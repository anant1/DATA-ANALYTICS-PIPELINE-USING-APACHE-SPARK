20180501,business,economy,3,WITH THE ARRIVAL IN BEIJING THIS WEEK OF AMERICAS TOP TRADE NEGOTIATORS  YOU MIGHT THINK THAT THE U S  AND CHINA ARE ABOUT TO ENTER HIGH LEVEL TALKS TO AVOID A TRADE WAR AND THAT THIS IS A STORY FOR THE BUSINESS PAGES  THINK AGAIN  THIS IS ONE FOR THE HISTORY BOOKS FIVE DAYS OF MEETINGS IN BEIJING WITH CHINESE  U S  AND EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND BUSINESS LEADERS MADE IT CRYSTAL CLEAR TO ME THAT WHATS GOING ON RIGHT NOW IS NOTHING LESS THAN A STRUGGLE TO REDEFINE THE RULES GOVERNING THE ECONOMIC AND POWER RELATIONS OF THE WORLDS OLDEST AND NEWEST SUPERPOWERS  AMERICA AND CHINA  THIS IS NOT A TRADE TIFF THIS IS A DEFINING MOMENT FOR U S CHINA RELATIONS  SAID RUAN ZONGZE  EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRYS RESEARCH INSTITUTE  THIS IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN TRADE AND TARIFFS  THIS IS ABOUT THE FUTURE IN ONE CORNER STAND PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS TEAM OF CHINA TRADE HARD LINERS  WHOSE INSTINCT IS BASICALLY RIGHT  THIS IS A FIGHT WORTH HAVING NOW  BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE  BEFORE CHINA GETS TOO BIG AND IN THE OTHER CORNER STANDS PRESIDENT XI JINPING OF CHINA  WHOSE INSTINCT MAY ALSO BE RIGHT  THIS IS A FIGHT WORTH HAVING NOW  BECAUSE IT IS TOO LATE  CHINA IS JUST TOO BIG OR  AS ONE CHINESE EXPERT PUT IT AT A TSINGHUA UNIVERSITY DIALOGUE ON TRADE I ATTENDED  NO ONE CAN CONTAIN CHINA ANYMORE  YOU HEAR THAT CONFIDENCE IN BEIJING A LOT TODAY FROM CHINESE  OUR ONE PARTY SYSTEM AND UNIFIED SOCIETY CAN TAKE THE PAIN OF A TRADE WAR FAR LONGER THAN YOU AMERICANS CAN  AND THERE IS A TRADE IMBALANCE TODAY BECAUSE WEVE BEEN INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE AND YOU AMERICANS HAVE BEEN EATING YOURS A CHINESE ECONOMIST WHO WORKED IN THE WEST SUMMARIZED IT THIS WAY  YOU BROUGHT CHINA INTO THE WORLD AND CHANGED CHINA  BUT NOW CHINA IS IN THE WORLD AND IT IS BECOMING SELF PROPELLED HERES HOW WE GOT HERE  IN ACT I  U S CHINA RELATIONS WERE ALL GEOPOLITICS  WITH THE U S  AND CHINA AGAINST THE SOVIET UNION  THAT LASTED UNTIL THE LATE 1970S  WHEN ACT II BEGAN  CHINA SHIFTED TOWARD CAPITALISM  BECOMING A HUGE FACTORY AND NEW MARKET  AND 30 YEARS LATER TURNED INTO THE WORLDS SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN LARGE PART THIS WAS DUE TO THE WORK ETHIC OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE  THE LONG TERM THINKING OF CHINAS LEADERS AND THE GOVERNMENTS MASSIVE INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND EDUCATION  BUT IN PART IT WAS ALSO DUE TO CHINAS WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO BEND OR IGNORE RULES OF THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AND  AT TIMES  OUTRIGHT CHEAT IN SOME CASES CHINA USED INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE TO JUST STEAL INNOVATIONS FROM THE WEST  OTHER MOVES WERE MORE SUBTLE  WHEN CHINA JOINED THE W T O  IN 2001  IT WAS ALLOWED IN AS A DEVELOPING NATION  SUBJECT TO VERY LOW TARIFFS ON ITS EXPORTS TO OUR COUNTRY BUT PERMITTED TO IMPOSE HIGH TARIFFS TO PROTECT ITS OWN RISING INDUSTRIES FROM U S  AND EUROPEAN COMPETITION THE ASSUMPTION WAS THAT AS CHINA GREW  AND THE W T O  MOVED TO A NEW REGIME  CHINA WOULD QUICKLY CUT ITS TARIFFS  LIKE ITS 25 PERCENT TAX ON CAR IMPORTS  COMPARED WITH THE 2 5 PERCENT TARIFF IMPOSED BY THE U S  BUT THE W T O  STILL HAS NOT COMPLETED A NEW TRADE ROUND AND CHINA HAS REFUSED TO VOLUNTARILY LOWER ITS TARIFFS MOREOVER  CHINA DEVELOPED AN INDUSTRIAL POLICY THAT OFTEN BENT W T O  RULES  THE GOVERNMENT GAVE AWAY CHEAP LAND  AND STATE GUIDED BANKS GRANTED CHEAP LOANS FOR NEW INDUSTRIES  BUT FOREIGN COMPANIES THAT WANTED ACCESS TO CHINAS MARKET WERE FORCED TO PAY TO PLAY  TO HAVE A CHINESE PARTNER AND BE WILLING TO TRANSFER THEIR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO THEM AS A RESULT  OVER TIME  BEIJING WAS ABLE TO FORCE MULTINATIONALS TO SHIFT MORE AND MORE OF THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS TO CHINA  AND GROW CHINESE COMPETITORS TO WESTERN COMPANIES IN ITS PROTECTED MARKET  AND THEN  ONCE THEY WERE BIG ENOUGH  UNLEASH THEM ON THE WORLD AS GIANTS EVEN WHEN THE U S  PROTESTED TO THE W T O   AS IN THE CASE OF HOW CHINA UNFAIRLY KEPT U S  CREDIT CARD COMPANIES OUT  THEN LOST THE ARBITRATION CASE AT THE W T O   CHINA STILL DRAGGED ITS FEET BEFORE FOLLOWING THROUGH ON PROMISES MADE 17 YEARS EARLIER TO OPEN UP  BY THEN  CHINESE COMPANIES  LIKE UNIONPAY  SO DOMINATED CHINAS CREDIT CARD MARKET THAT U S  COMPANIES  LIKE VISA  WERE LEFT WITH THE CRUMBS MEANWHILE  CHINESE GOVERNMENT GUIDED COMPANIES AND INVESTMENT FUNDS WENT ABROAD AND BEGAN TO BUY UP STRATEGIC INDUSTRIES TO BRING THEIR TECHNOLOGY BACK TO CHINA  LIKE GERMANYS BIGGEST AND BEST ROBOTICS COMPANY  KUKA U S  AND EUROPEAN BUSINESSES TOLERATED ALL OF THIS BECAUSE THEY WERE STILL MAKING MONEY IN CHINA OR WERE AFRAID TO BE FROZEN OUT OF ITS MASSIVE  GROWING MARKET  UNTIL A COUPLE YEARS AGO  WHEN MORE AND MORE TOLD THEIR GOVERNMENTS  THIS IS NOT WORKING ANYMORE  THAT USHERED IN ACT III ACT III OPENED IN OCTOBER 2015  WHEN CHINA ANNOUNCED ITS NEW LONG TERM VISION  MADE IN CHINA 2025  A PLAN TO DOMINATE 10 NEXT GENERATION INDUSTRIES  INCLUDING ROBOTICS  SELF DRIVING CARS  ELECTRIC VEHICLES  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  BIOTECH AND AEROSPACE WHEN THE U S  AND EUROPE SAW THIS  THEY BASICALLY SAID  WOW  WE WERE READY TO TURN THE OTHER CHEEK WHEN YOUR COMBINATION OF HARD WORK  CHEATING AND INDUSTRIAL POLICY WAS FOCUSED ON LOW END INDUSTRIES  BUT IF YOU USE THE SAME STRATEGIES TO DOMINATE THESE HIGH END INDUSTRIES  WERE TOAST  WE NEED SOME NEW RULES AND I HEARD THIS AS MUCH FROM E U  OFFICIALS AS U S  ONES  THAT IS WHY MANY E U  COUNTRIES ARE NOW SCRAMBLING TO PASS NEW LAWS TO PREVENT CHINA FROM BUYING UP THEIR MOST ADVANCED INDUSTRIES  AND THAT IS WHY CHINA IS TELLING E U  COUNTRIES  AS ONE E U  OFFICIAL PUT IT  WHATEVER YOU DO  DONT JOIN THE U S  CAMP ON TRADE  THE LAST THING BEIJING WANTS IS A U S E U  UNITED FRONT DEMANDING IT PLAY FAIR DONT GET ME WRONG  I AM A FREE TRADER AND GENUINELY NOT AFRAID OF SOME STATE DIRECTED 2025 PLAN BEATING WESTERN FREE MARKET INNOVATORS  I WELCOME CHINA FOCUSING MORE ON 21ST CENTURY INDUSTRIES  IT COULD BE BETTER FOR EVERYONE ECONOMICS IS NOT LIKE WAR  THEY CAN WIN AND WE CAN WIN  ON ONE CONDITION  WE ALL PLAY BY THE SAME RULES  HARD WORK AND INNOVATION  NOT HARD WORK AND STEALING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  MASSIVE GOVERNMENT INTERVENTIONS  IGNORING W T O  RULES  LACK OF RECIPROCITY AND FORCING WESTERN COMPANIES TO PAY TO PLAY INSIDE CHINA THAT IS WHAT THIS MOMENT IS ABOUT  THATS WHY ITS A FIGHT WORTH HAVING  DONT LET THE FACT THAT TRUMP IS LEADING THE CHARGE DISTRACT FROM THE VITAL IMPORTANCE OF THE U S  EUROPE AND CHINA ALL AGREEING ON THE SAME RULES FOR 2025  BEFORE IT REALLY IS TOO LATE HAVE NO DOUBT  THOUGH  BOTH PRESIDENTS TRUMP AND XI ARE APPROACHING THIS MOMENT WITH ENORMOUSLY HIGH RISK STRATEGIES AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE AT A HISTORIC JUNCTURE IN DEFINING THE WESTS ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH CHINA  CLEARLY OUR NO  1 PRIORITY  TRUMP IS ALSO RISKING A TRADE WAR WITH THE VERY ALLIES WE NEED TO MOVE CHINA IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION  JAPAN  SOUTH KOREA  EUROPE AND CANADA  BY THREATENING THEM WITH STEEL AND ALUMINUM TARIFFS IF THEY DONT MEET HIS DEMANDS  TRUMP SEEMS TO BELIEVE THAT HE CAN RESHAPE HOW CHINA APPROACHES THE NEXT ERA OF GLOBAL TRADE WITHOUT ALLIES  JUST AMERICAN BRUTE FORCE  GOOD LUCK WITH THAT AS ONE E U  OFFICIAL WARNED ME  IF YOUR CONCERN IS U S  JOBS  CHINA IS THE BIG CHALLENGE AND YOU SHOULD NOT BE STARTING A STEEL WAR WITH EUROPE  NOBODY IS GOING TO GO WITH YOU ON CHINA IF YOURE HITTING US ON STEEL  ADDED ONE LONGTIME U S  OBSERVER IN BEIJING  IF WE MAKE THIS THE U S  VERSUS CHINA ALONE  WE LOSE WORSE  TRUMP TORE UP THE TRANS PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP  WHICH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT TOGETHER THE MOST POWERFUL ECONOMIES ON THE PACIFIC RIM AROUND A SET OF TRADE RULES PERFECTLY ALIGNED WITH U S  INTERESTS AND FOCUSED ON ALL THOSE THINGS  LIKE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  THAT WE WANT CHINA TO EMBRACE AS IT MOVES TO 2025 IN SHORT  WITH A LOT OF ALLIES IN EUROPE AND ON THE PACIFIC  WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MOVE CHINA IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION  BUT TRUMP IS ALIENATING THEM ALL  HOW FOOLISH IS THAT TRUMP ALSO HAS NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT INVESTING IN THE REAL SOURCE OF LONG TERM U S  STRENGTH  INFRASTRUCTURE AND EDUCATION BUT XIS BET IS ALSO NO SLAM DUNK  CHINA IS A MUCH MORE OPEN COUNTRY TODAY THAN IT WAS 25 YEARS AGO  BUT ITS ALSO MUCH LESS OPEN THAN IT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO  XIS ALLIES ARGUE THAT HIS CRACKDOWN ON CORRUPTION  HIS REPEAL OF TERM LIMITS  WHICH POSITION HIM TO RULE FOR WHAT COULD BE DECADES  AND HIS TIGHTENING OF THE CONTROL THAT THE COMMUNIST PARTY WIELDS OVER EVERY INSTITUTION WAS URGENT BECAUSE COLLECTIVE RULE DID NOT WORK  CHINAS SOCIETY  GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY WERE BEING EATEN AWAY BY CORRUPTION FROM WITHIN  THOSE ALLIES SAY THAT MAY HAVE BEEN TRUE  BUT CREATING A REGIME OF ONE MAN RULE  CONTROLLING THE INTERNET  FREE SPEECH AND UNIVERSITIES MORE TIGHTLY THAN EVER  AND RESURRECTING THE TEACHING OF MARXIST THOUGHT CANNOT BE THE BEST WAY TO STIMULATE AND ATTRACT THE MOST CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE MINDS THAT CHINA NEEDS TO PROPEL A START UP ECONOMY AND DELIVER ON MADE IN CHINA 2025 WILL CHINAS BEST AND BRIGHTEST WANT TO WORK IN SUCH A SYSTEM  I DONT KNOW  CHINAS AUTOCRACY HAS MANAGED TO PRODUCE A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF PATENTS AND START UPS SO FAR  SO MAYBE XI CAN PULL THIS OFF  BUT ITS A BIG BET AS I SAID  THIS IS NOT JUST A FRONT PAGE BUSINESS NEWS STORY  WHATS BEING WRITTEN IS THE FIRST PAGE OF A WHOLE NEW CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF U S CHINA RELATIONS  AND HOW IT GETS WRITTEN AND HOW IT ENDS WILL SHAPE THE TRUMP AND XI LEGACIES  AND TOUCH EVERY MAJOR ECONOMY IN THE WORLD

20180504,entertainment,entertainment,9,FRIDAY PUZZLE  SOMETIMES THERE ARE TRADE OFFS TO BE MADE IN CROSSWORD CONSTRUCTION  IF A CONSTRUCTOR WANTS TO STACK LONG ENTRIES  HE OR SHE NEEDS TO ACCEPT THAT NOT ALL OF THE SHORT CROSSINGS WILL BE PRIZE WINNERS  AN ABUNDANCE OF BLACK SQUARES IN AN UNUSUAL DESIGN WILL CLOSE OFF A GRID THAT COULD HAVE BEEN WIDE OPEN AND HAD MORE OF THOSE LONG  EXCITING ENTRIES WE LIKE TO SEE ON THE WEEKEND  THESE THINGS DO NOT NECESSARILY MAKE FOR A BAD PUZZLE  MIND YOU  BUT THEY ARE SOME OF THE THINGS CONSTRUCTORS KEEP IN MIND AS THEY CREATE OUR ENTERTAINMENT FOR US MY FIRST IMPRESSION WHEN I LOOKED AT MICHAEL HAWKINSS GRID WAS  HUH  THIS DOESNT REALLY LOOK LIKE A FRIDAY GRID TO ME  THE BLACK SQUARE PATTERN WAS NOT THE TYPICAL STAIR STEP ONE  AND IT FELT AS IF PARTS OF HIS GRID WERE CLOSED OFF FOR REASONS I COULDNT QUITE FATHOM  IM NOT JUDGING BY ANY MEANS  WHEN I CONSTRUCTED CROSSWORD PUZZLES  BLACK SQUARE PLACEMENT WAS ONE OF MY WEAKNESSES  WELL BE DISCUSSING THAT MORE ON MAY 11  WHEN THE GRID DESIGN ARTICLE IN THE HOW TO MAKE A CROSSWORD PUZZLE SERIES COMES OUT ON THE OTHER HAND  MR  HAWKINS HAS SOME VERY NICE LONG ENTRIES IN HIS PUZZLE  HE ALSO HAS FIVE LOVELY DEBUTS  INCLUDING THE AU COURANT HACKTIVISM  THERE IS SOME TRICKY CLUING  WHICH ADDS TO THE CHALLENGE AND ENTERTAINMENT SO WHERE DOES THAT LAND US  TO FIGURE THIS OUT  WE BRING OUT SOMETHING READERS HAVE NOT SEEN IN A WHILE  THE SCALES OF CRUCIVERBAL JUSTICE  THESE SPECIAL AND COMPLETELY PROFESSIONALLY RENDERED SCALES ARE USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER WEVE HAD A GOOD TIME SOLVING THE PUZZLE  ONE NOTE  ITS AN ART  NOT A SCIENCE  MY FRIENDS  ALSO  THE BIRD MOVES AROUND A LOT  SO TAKE ALL THIS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT AND DECIDE FOR YOURSELF THE PRO SIDE OF THE SCALE MR  HAWKINS IS WELL WITHIN THE NUMBER OF WORDS  72  THAT WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE IN A FRIDAY PUZZLE  ITS NOT A RECORD BREAKER FOR FEWEST NUMBER OF WORDS  BUT THERE ARENT TOO MANY  EITHER  HIS 10 LETTER STACKS AT THE TOP AND BOTTOM ARE VERY INTERESTING  I ESPECIALLY LIKED HACKTIVISM  STAYCATION  PRETTY MUCH MY TYPICAL VACATION  AND LETS DO THIS  SOME OF THE LONG DOWNS ARE REALLY GOOD  KRYPTON  MONEY TALKS  CARAMEL CORN  SEA SALT  I ALSO LIKED OPEN WIDE AND TAKES OFF  THERE IS A NEAT AND SCRABBLY NORTHEAST  WITH XYLEM CROSSING A F C  WEST  THERE WAS A LOT OF EFFORT PUT INTO THE CLUING  AND THE WORDPLAY IS AT A SATISFYING LEVEL THE CON SIDE OF THE SCALE UNUSUAL AND CLOSED OFF GRID DESIGN  GRID DESIGN LEADS TO INTERRUPTIONS IN THE FLOW OF SOLVING AND SHORTER ENTRIES  A COMBINATION OF THE GRID DESIGN AND THE STACKS LEADS TO SOME GLUEY FILL  AMT  TECS  PSY  REF  CSI  OTHER THAN HACKTIVISM  THERE IS NOTHING REALLY CUTTING EDGE HERE  ALTHOUGH THE SCALES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS MIGHT NOT BE A CON TO EVERYONE SO I WOUND UP HAVING A PRETTY GOOD TIME  ALL TOLD  MR  HAWKINSS PUZZLE FELT UNUSUAL WHILE I SOLVED IT  MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE GRID DESIGN  BUT I THINK IT WAS WORTH MY TIME FOR THE FRIDAY MENTAL TUG OF WAR ALONE  ADD TO THAT THE NUMBER AND QUALITY OF LIVELY ENTRIES COMPARED WITH THE RELATIVELY LOW AMOUNT OF GLUEY FILL  AND I CAN SEE WHY THE EDITORS ACCEPTED MR  HAWKINSS PUZZLE TRICKY CLUES17A  A STAYCATION CAN BE ONE OF THE MOST RELAXING KINDS OF VACATIONS BECAUSE YOU 1  ESCAPE THE HORRORS OF AIR TRAVEL  AND 2  DONT HAVE TO UNPACK AND DO DIRTY VACATION LAUNDRY WHEN YOU GET HOME

20180502,politics,election,10,WASHINGTON  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS ANGRILY PROTESTING A LEAKED LIST OF QUESTIONS THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT S SPECIAL COUNSEL MAY WANT TO ASK HIM  WHILE AT THE SAME TIME CONTENDING THE LIST SHOWS ANEW THERE WAS NO CRIME OR COLLUSION WITH THE RUSSIANS BY HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  BUT THE QUESTIONS SUGGEST THAT INVESTIGATORS WANT TO FOCUS ON COLLUSION AND OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE THE QUESTIONS  SOME 49 IN ALL  WERE PUBLISHED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES  WHICH SAID THEY WERE COMPILED BY TRUMP S LAWYERS DURING NEGOTIATIONS WITH SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER S INVESTIGATORS OVER A POSSIBLE INTERVIEW WITH THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF  THE TIMES SAID IT GOT THE LIST FROM SOMEONE  OUTSIDE MR  TRUMP S LEGAL TEAM A PERSON FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER  WHO INSISTED ON ANONYMITY TO DISCUSS ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS  TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS THAT THE TRUMP LAWYERS EXTRAPOLATED A LIST OF EXPECTED QUESTIONS BASED OFF CONVERSATIONS WITH MUELLER S TEAM  THE QUESTIONS CONTAINED IN A DOCUMENT POSTED ONLINE BY THE TIMES ON MONDAY NIGHT REFLECTED QUESTIONS THAT DEFENSE LAWYERS ANTICIPATED RATHER THAN VERBATIM QUERIES THAT MUELLER S TEAM PROVIDED  THE PERSON SAID THE LEAK WAS  SO DISGRACEFUL  TRUMP TWEETED ON TUESDAY   NO QUESTIONS ON COLLUSION  HE SAID   COLLUSION THAT NEVER EXISTED  THAT S THE IDEA THAT HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN COLLABORATED WITH RUSSIANS WHO WERE TRYING TO HELP HIM TO THE OVAL OFFICE  AS FOR OBSTRUCTION OF THE INVESTIGATION AFTER HE TOOK OFFICE  HE SCOFFED   IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO OBSTRUCT JUSTICE FOR A CRIME THAT NEVER HAPPENED THERE S STILL NO WORD FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AS TO WHETHER TRUMP WILL SIT DOWN TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS OR OTHERS FOR THE INVESTIGATION SOME TAKEAWAYS FROM THE LIST OBSTRUCTION IS A KEY FOCUSIT HAS LONG BEEN CLEAR THAT MUELLER IS INTERESTED IN WHETHER TRUMP MAY HAVE OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE  THE QUESTIONS PUBLISHED BY THE TIMES SHOW JUST HOW MUCH OF A FOCUS IT COULD BE ALTHOUGH MUELLER S TEAM HAS INDICATED TO TRUMP S LAWYERS THAT HE S NOT CONSIDERED A  TARGET  OF THE PROBE  INVESTIGATORS WANT TO INTERVIEW HIM ABOUT SEVERAL EPISODES EARLY IN HIS TERM THE BULK OF THE QUESTIONS FOCUS ON THE FIRING OF FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY  TRUMP S RELATIONSHIP WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS  WHOM HE HAS ANGRILY CRITICIZED FOR RECUSING HIMSELF FROM THE RUSSIA PROBE  AND HIS FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER  MICHAEL FLYNN  ACCORDING TO COMEY  TRUMP ENCOURAGED COMEY TO DROP AN INVESTIGATION INTO FLYNN THE QUESTIONS ATTEMPT TO DRILL DOWN INTO TRUMP S CONFLICTING PUBLIC ANSWERS FOR HIS REASONS FOR FIRING COMEY  IN ONE INTERVIEW HE REFERENCED  THIS RUSSIA THING   AND ASK HIM ABOUT THE DECISION MORE DIRECTLY REGARDING THE DECISION TO FIRE MR  COMEY  WHEN WAS IT MADE  WHY  WHO PLAYED A ROLE  READS ONE QUESTION COLLUSION IS STILL A FOCUS  TOODESPITE TRUMP S DISMISSAL OF THE IDEA  THE LIST DOES APPEAR TO INDICATE THAT MUELLER IS LOOKING INTO POSSIBLE COLLUSION OR COORDINATION WITH RUSSIA  SOME TOUCH ON RUSSIAN MEDDLING IN THE U S  ELECTION AND WHETHER THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN COORDINATED IN ANY WAY WITH THE KREMLIN  ONE QUESTION ASKS WHAT TRUMP KNEW ABOUT MEMBERS OF HIS CAMPAIGN STAFF  INCLUDING FORMER CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN PAUL MANAFORT  REACHING OUT TO MOSCOW MUELLER HAS BROUGHT SEVERAL CHARGES AGAINST MANAFORT ALREADY  INCLUDING MONEY LAUNDERING AND BANK FRAUD  NONE OF THE CHARGES RELATES TO ALLEGATIONS OF RUSSIAN ELECTION INTERFERENCE AND POSSIBLE COORDINATION WITH TRUMP ASSOCIATES  AND MANAFORT HAS DENIED HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH ANY SUCH EFFORT ANOTHER QUESTION ASKS WHAT DISCUSSIONS TRUMP MAY HAVE HAD REGARDING  ANY MEETING  WITH RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN  STILL ANOTHER ASKS WHAT THE PRESIDENT MAY HAVE KNOWN ABOUT A POSSIBLE ATTEMPT BY HIS SON IN LAW  JARED KUSHNER  TO SET UP A BACK CHANNEL WITH RUSSIA BEFORE THE U S  INAUGURATION MUELLER IS WATCHING TRUMP S TWEETSAT LEAST TWO QUESTIONS DIRECTLY ADDRESS TWEETS FROM THE PRESIDENT ONE ASKS   WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF YOUR MAY 12  2017  TWEET  THAT REFERENCES A TWEET TRUMP POSTED AFTER REPORTS THAT COMEY DESCRIBED A PRIVATE DINNER WITH THE PRESIDENT IN PERSONAL MEMOS  COMEY WROTE IN A MEMO THAT TRUMP REPEATEDLY ASKED HIM FOR LOYALTY JAMES COMEY BETTER HOPE THAT THERE ARE NO  TAPES  OF OUR CONVERSATIONS BEFORE HE STARTS LEAKING TO THE PRESS  TRUMP TWEETED ANOTHER QUESTION ASKS ABOUT TWEETS IN WHICH TRUMP SUGGESTED COMEY SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED FOR THE WAY HE HANDLED AN INVESTIGATION INTO HILLARY CLINTON S EMAILS THE QUESTIONS ALSO REFERENCE TELEVISION INTERVIEWS THAT TRUMP HAS GIVEN WILL TRUMP ACTUALLY FACE THESE QUESTIONS IT S STILL UNCLEAR WHETHER MUELLER S INVESTIGATORS WILL BE ABLE TO ASK TRUMP ANY QUESTIONS  OR WHETHER THESE ARE THE ONES THEY WOULD ASK  TRUMP HAS SAID HE WANTS TO TALK TO MUELLER  BUT MORE RECENTLY  HE AND HIS TEAM OF LAWYERS  WHICH HAS UNDERGONE CHANGES IN RECENT MONTHS  HAVE NOT SAID WHEN  OR IF IT S ALSO NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE LEAK OF THE QUESTIONS WAS MEANT TO SOMEHOW INFLUENCE WHETHER TRUMP WILL DO THE INTERVIEW COMEY  IN AN INTERVIEW  GAVE AN OPINION THAT STEERED CLEAR OF POLITICS AND SOUNDED LIKE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL HE USED TO BE   JUST AS WE VE DONE IN MANY INVESTIGATIONS  YOU WANT TO DEVELOP A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTS AND THEN CHECK THEM WITH THE SUBJECT AND SEE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT IT IN THE MEANTIME  MUELLER S INVESTIGATION CONTINUES  ON TUESDAY  THE SPECIAL COUNSEL S OFFICE AND FLYNN  A KEY COOPERATOR  AGREED TO PUT OFF SETTING HIS SENTENCING DATE FOR ANOTHER 60 DAYS  SAYING THE DELAY WAS NECESSARY  DUE TO THE STATUS  OF THE INVESTIGATION ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER CHAD DAY CONTRIBUTED TO THIS REPORT

20180503,politics,trump,9,LAST WEEK WE ASKED STUDENTS TO POST SUGGESTED TO MEASURES  AND THEN  AND PERHAPS ONLY THEN  WILL YOU LEARN TO APPRECIATE MUSIC THE WAY IT WAS MEANT TO BE APPRECIATED THE BEST WAY TO WATCH A CONCERT WHERE CLASSICAL MUSIC IS BEING PLAYED IS TO SIMPLY NOT WATCH AT ALL  CLOSE YOUR EYES  LET YOUR MIND WANDER AS THE ORCHESTRA CARRIES YOU THROUGH MAJOR AND MINOR  THROUGH TEMPOS YOU CAN FEEL THROUGHOUT YOUR ENTIRE BODY  DONT LET YOURSELF BE INTIMIDATED COLLIN FROM LAWRENCE DISLIKES THE PRETENTION AROUND CLASSICAL MUSIC  AND SAYS IT IS FOR EVERYONE IT IS SAD TO HEAR THAT PEOPLE ARE INTIMIDATED BY CLASSICAL MUSIC I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY SAYING THAT I HAVE BEEN PLAYING THE PIANO FOR A WHILE AND I CAN SEE WHERE PEOPLE MIGHT FEEL INTIMIDATED BY A CLASSICAL PIECE  IN MOST CLASSICAL PIECES THERE ISNT A BAND OR A PRODUCER  THERE ARE 50 OR SO MUSICIANS WORKING TOGETHER TO PRODUCE A MASTERPIECE TO THE EAR  THIS IS INTIMIDATION IN ITS OWN RIGHT  MOST PEOPLE DONT SIT DOWN WITH SOME FRIENDS AND THROW ON THE FOUR SEASONS BY VIVALDI  IT IS COMPLEX AND FULL OF LIFE  TO TRULY ENJOY IT YOU MUST LISTEN TO IT LIVE  BUT  WHERE THERE IS LIVE MUSIC  THERE WILL BE PEOPLE  HERE IS WHERE I CAN UNDERSTAND  I CANT TELL YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TRY TO PUT THEMSELVES ABOVE EVERYONE ELSE BY TALKING ABOUT HOW SPLENDID THE CRESCENDO WAS OR HOW THE STACCATO REALLY GIVES THE PIECE A UNIQUE SOUND THIS STUFF EVEN ANNOYS ME  AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS  TO SOMEONE JUST LOOKING TO ENJOY SOME NICE MUSIC  THIS CAN BE A MAJOR TURN OFF  I THINK THIS IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE FOR NEWCOMERS  THERE SEEMS TO BE AN OBLIGATION TO SAY CRESCENDO INSTEAD OF  IT GETS LOUDER  THIS NEGATIVE STIGMA MAKES IT SEEM LIKE YOU MUST BE WELL EDUCATED TO ENJOY MUSIC  THIS ISNT TRUE  IF YOU HAVE EARS  YOU CAN APPRECIATE MUSIC  ITS THAT SIMPLE KAPLAN AKTAS FROM NORTH CAROLINA THINKS FAMILIARITY ADDS TO THE ATTRACTION IVE LOVED CLASSICAL MUSIC SINCE I FIRST LISTENED TO IT AND TO PUT IT PLAINLY  I CANT WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THIS CLASSIC MUSIC INSECURITY COMPLEX BECAUSE CLASSIC MUSIC IN AND OF ITSELF IS A FORM OF ART  THE SYMPHONIES ARE EACH LIKE A VIVID PAINTING AND THE COMPOSER AN ARTIST  AS FOR THE SECOND QUESTION  I WOULD TOTALLY BE WILLING TO LISTEN TO A PERFORMANCE OR PIECE DUE TO THE DEDICATION OF THE COMPOSER OR VIOLINIST ETC  AND THE BEAUTY THAT IS CLASSIC MUSIC THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I CANT APPRECIATE MUSIC IF I KNOW WHAT IT WAS TRULY ABOUT OR HOW IT WAS CREATED  OR SIMPLY BECAUSE IVE LISTENED TO IT WAY TO MANY TIMES  BUT ON THE CONTRARY  THE MORE I KNOW ABOUT A CERTAIN SONG  ON THE MATTER OF HOW IT WAS MADE OR ITS MEANING  I CAN LIKE IT MUCH MORE LIKE OVERTURE WITH CANNONS  YES  HE ACTUALLY HAD CANNONS AT THE PERFORMANCE  WHICH WAS MADE BY TCHAIKOVSKY TO COMMEMORATE NAPOLEONS INVASION OF RUSSIA  OR RICHARD WAGNERS RIDE OF THE VALKYRIES WHICH REMINDS ME OF THE ICONIC OPENING SCENE OF RIDE OF THE VALKYRIES AND MANY OTHER PARALLEL SCENES ELLIOTT ODEEN FROM NORTH CAROLINA HOPES CLASSICAL STYLE MUSIC WILL CONTINUE TO BE PLAYED AND ENJOYED I AM A MUSICIAN AND I LOVE AND APPRECIATE ALL MUSIC  I APPRECIATE MODERN DAY MUSIC AND SYMPHONIC PIECES FROM THE 1800S  I KNOW PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE CMI  THE INSECURITY OF NOT BEING ABLE TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF MUSIC BUT STILL ARE MOVED  I DONT THINK ANYONE SHOULD FEEL THAT WAY BECAUSE YES THE COMPOSER OR ARTIST HAVE INTENTIONS WITH THE WAYS THEY WANT YOU TO FEEL BUT MUSIC IS FOR EVERYONE  WHETHER YOU ARE A MUSICIAN OR JUST A CASUAL LISTENER  ITS OKAY TO HAVE OPINIONS ABOUT MUSIC IN WHICH YOU DONT KNOW THE FULL MEANING CLASSICAL STYLE MUSIC WILL HOPEFULLY ALWAYS BE MADE SO THERE IS ALWAYS TIME TO HAVE A GREAT APPRECIATION FOR IT EVEN IF YOU DONT FULLY GET IT ELEANOR BLACK FROM WILMINGTON  N C  HAS JUST BEGUN TO APPRECIATE CLASSICAL MUSIC I HAVE RECENTLY BEGUN TO LISTEN TO CLASSICAL MUSIC  I THINK IT IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE AND IM ASHAMED TO SAY THAT I DIDNT REALIZE I HAD BEEN INTIMIDATED BY IT UNTIL I READ THIS ARTICLE  EVERYTHING ABOUT CLASSICAL MUSIC IS BOLD AND SOPHISTICATED  THE VOLUME  THE TEMPO  EVEN THE WORDS THEY USE TO DESCRIBE THEIR PIECES SUCH AS THE WORK FEATURES A TRUNCATED DEVELOPMENT WITH CHROMATIC MODULATIONS TO DISTANT KEYS AND MODALLY INFLECTED MOTIVIC CELLS  THE CLASSICAL MUSIC INSECURITY COMPLEX IS WHAT CAUSES PEOPLE TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE LISTENING AND OR TALKING ABOUT THIS GENRE  YOU DONT HAVE TO KNOW A THING ABOUT CLASSICAL MUSIC TO ENJOY LISTENING TO IT  ITS ALL ABOUT THE WAY THE MUSIC MAKES YOU FEEL WHEN YOU LISTEN TO IT AND I HOPE THAT MORE PEOPLE WILL ONE DAY BE WILLING TO BRANCH OUT OF THEIR COMFORT ZONE AND TRY LISTENING TO IT JOHN SMITH FROM CHERRY HILL  N J  REFERENCES SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE THAT MUSIC CHANGES THE BRAIN  AND THINKS BOTH MUSIC AND THE BRAIN INSPIRE AWE MUSICOPHILIA  MUSIC   THE BRAIN IS ONE OF THE MASTERPIECES OF THE LATE RENOWNED NEUROLOGIST  OLIVER SACKS  TO ME IT IS HIS CROWNING GLORY  SACKS WROTE THAT WITH THE BRAIN SCANS OF THE 80S AND 90S  SCIENTISTS WERE ABLE TO OBSERVE THE ACTIVITY IN CENTERS OF THE BRAIN FAR MORE ACCURATELY THAN BEFORE  THEY DISCOVERED THAT MUSIC ENGAGES MORE BRAIN ACTIVITY THAN ANY OTHER HUMAN AREA OF STUDY  IN FACT  HE MENTIONED IN AN INTERVIEW WITH TERRY GROSS IN FRESH AIR ON NPR THAT IF HE HAD EINSTEINS BRAIN  IT WOULD LOOK NO DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER BRAIN  BUT IF HE TOOK THE BRAIN OF A PROFESSIONAL MUSICIAN  THE IMPACT OF MUSIC ON THE BRAIN RESULTS IN HIGHLY VISIBLE CHANGES IN ITS STRUCTURE  INCLUDING THE THICKENING OF THE CORPUS COLLOSSUM THAT CONNECTS THE TWO HEMISPHERES OF THE BRAIN AND GROWTH IN THE AREA OF THE BRAIN WHERE SOUND IS PROCESSED  AS WELL AS OTHER AREAS  MUSIC AND THE BRAIN INSPIRE AWE AND WONDERMENT  JUST RELAX AND ENJOY IT  YOUR BRAIN WILL TAKE CARE OF THE REST  OF COURSE  IF YOU WISH TO STUDY  YOU CAN DO THAT TOO JULIAN FANDINO FROM NEW YORK SAYS EXPOSURE BRINGS A LEVEL OF COMFORT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN EXPOSED TO CLASSICAL MUSIC  ART  AND THEATER  EVER SINCE I WAS IN MY MOTHERS WOMB  CLASSICAL MUSIC HAS BEEN PART OF MY LIFE  MY INTEREST AND ENJOYMENT OF SUCH ART FORMS COMES AS A RESULT OF MY EXPOSURE TO SUCH  THIS HAS ALLOWED ME TO BE MORE COMFORTABLE AND INTERESTED IN SEEKING AN UNDERSTANDING OF THESE MEDIUMS  IN THE END  IT WAS MY INTERACTIONS WITH CLASSICAL MUSIC  ART  AND THEATER THAT HAVE FURTHER ENHANCED MY ENJOYMENT OF THEM  I FEEL MY EXPERIENCE IS A GREAT EXAMPLE FOR THE CLAIM MADE BY MR  HOFFMAN  THERES NO DENYING THAT THE MORE WE KNOW ABOUT MUSIC  AS WITH COOKING OR GARDENING OR FOOTBALL  THE MORE LEVELS OF ENJOYMENT ARE AVAILABLE TO US RAMATOULAYE DIALLO FROM NEW YORK SAID RELATIVES AND FRIENDS HAVE INFLUENCE GROWING UP  I WOULD ALWAYS LISTEN TO RAP AND R B  IF SOMEONE WERE TO TELL ME TO LISTEN TO CLASSICAL MUSIC I WOULD HAVE PROBABLY LAUGHED AND WONDER IF THEY WERE SERIOUS  THE PEOPLE I WAS SURROUNDED BY INFLUENCED ME TO LISTEN TO MUSIC ASIDE FROM CLASSICAL MUSIC  IN ALL I WOULD SAY THAT I AM INTIMIDATED BY MODERN ART AND CLASSICAL MUSIC BUT THAT ALL IS FROM MY ROOTS AND HOW I GREW UP  READING THIS ARTICLE DID NOT CHANGE MY OPINION ON CLASSICAL MUSIC BECAUSE I AM SO COSTUMED TO A SPECIFIC TYPE A MUSIC  I DO NOT SEE MYSELF ATTENDING A PERFORMANCE BECAUSE I AM SIMPLY NOT INTERESTED IN IT  HOWEVER  I DO AGREE WITH HOFFMAN WHEN HE SAID THAT THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM HAVE A PART IN CLASSICAL MUSIC INSECURITY STUDENTS WEIGH IN ON OUR PICTURE PROMPT BREAKDANCING WITH THEIR THOUGHTS ABOUT WHETHER DANCE SHOULD BE AN OLYMPIC EVENT KAYLA RENEE FROM PENNSYLVANIA SAYS IT SHOULD I SAY THAT IF CHEERLEADING AND GYMNASTICS ARE CONSIDERED A SPORT  THAT BREAKDANCING SHOULD BE TOO  BREAKDANCING IS MORE THAN JUST DANCING IT TARGETS YOUR MUSCLES AND REQUIRES STRENGTH  JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER SPORT  BREAKDANCING HAS ITS OWN WORLD OF BATTLING AND COMPETITIONS WHICH IS WHY I THINK IT SHOULDNT BE AN OLYMPIC SPORT  BUT IF IT WAS THATD BE PRETTY COOL BROOKE MYERS FROM KING OF PRUSSIA AGREES BREAK DANCING SHOULD DEFINITELY BE IN THE OLYMPICS  IT TAKES TONS OF PRACTICE LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE  USES A LOT OF CONCENTRATION  AND TAKES A LOT OF WORK  IT WOULD ALSO ADD A LITTLE MORE SPICE TO THE OLYMPICS  ID ALSO LIKE TO SEE ROCK CLIMBING AS AN OLYMPIC SPORT  ITS SO DIFFERENT AND PEOPLE DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT BUT IT TAKES THE SAME AMOUNT OF WORK  PRESSURE  CONCENTRATION  AND PRACTICE IF NOT MORE PINAPPLECAKE FROM NC THINKS DANCE IS MORE ABOUT ARTISTIC EXPRESSION THAN COMPETITION TAKING AN ART LIKE DANCING TO THE OLYMPICS IS SOMETHING I WOULD NOT WATCH  TO ME DANCING IS A WAY TO EXPRESS MYSELF WHEN I AM HAPPY OR EATING REALLY GOOD FOOD  WATCHING PEOPLE SHOW OFF THEIR DANCING SKILLS MIGHT BE COOL FOR THE NEXT PERSON BUT FOR ME ITS SOMETHING THAT HAS A DEEPER MEANING THAN COMPETITION NICK HARGROVE FROM WILMINGTON  N C  BELIEVES DANCE DOES NOT FIT THE CRITERIA FOR AN OLYMPIC EVENT I PERSONALLY DO NOT THINK BREAKDANCING SHOULD BE AN OLYMPIC SPORT  THERE HAS TO BE A POINT WHERE YOU DRAW THE LINE  THE ARTICLE WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT SOME THINGS SUCH AS A RUBIKS CUBE COMPETITION OR HACKY SACK WHICH JUST SEEMS PLAIN OUT ABSURD TO ME  WHILE THESE ACTIVITIES MAY TAKE A EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF TIME AND DEDICATION I DO NOT PERCEIVE THE PEOPLE COMPETING IN THESE COMPETITIONS AS ATHLETES  HONESTLY I THINK FOR THE IOC TO OPEN UP THE OLYMPICS TO NEW COMPETITIONS  IT RUINS THE INTEGRITY OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES  BREAKDANCING HAS NO PLACE IN THE OLYMPICS UNTIL IT IS FURTHER ESTABLISHED  SEROUJ APRAHAMIAN  A BREAKDANCER  EVEN PETITIONED THAT THE IOC WHO WAS KNOWN FOR BALLROOM DANCING WOULD HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO RUN A BREAKDANCING COMPETITION ANOTHER THING I FEEL LIKE THAT IS CRUCIAL WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER A NEW SPORT SHOULD BE INTRODUCED TO THE OLYMPIC GAMES IS IS THERE ROOM FOR IT  WHILE THERE ARE CURRENTLY 42 SUMMER SPORTS THERE ARE ONLY 15 WINTER SPORTS  ONE SPORT THAT I ENJOY PLAYING AND WATCHING IS BASEBALL  WHILE IT IS NOT RECOGNIZED AS AN OLYMPIC GAME I AM COMPLETELY FINE WITH IT AS THERE IS THE WORLD BASEBALL CLASSIC WHICH IS ALSO HELD EVERY FOUR YEARS WHILE THE ARTICLE MAY HAVE JOKINGLY MENTIONED DONKEY KONG AS A POTENTIAL OLYMPIC EVENT I DO SEE GAMING BEING AT LEAST QUESTIONED AS WHETHER IT SHOULD BE A OLYMPIC EVENT OR NOT  I PLAY PLENTY OF VIDEO GAMES MYSELF BUT RATHER THAN INTRODUCING ESPORTS INTO THE OLYMPICS THEY SHOULD INSTEAD CREATE AN E OLYMPICS HOW ALIKE ARE YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS  CHALLENGED STUDENTS TO THINK ABOUT THESE RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH THE LENS OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ON BRAIN ACTIVITY JAMES WILT FROM WILMINGTON  N C  THINKS FRIENDS CAN HAVE DISSIMILAR PERSONALITIES WHEN I FINISHED READING BOTH ARTICLES  I WAS LEFT SURPRISED AND SKEPTICAL THAT THERE MIGHT BE A SCIENTIFIC CORRELATION TO US BEING FRIENDS  ALTHOUGH THIS MIGHT BE TRUE  FRIENDSHIPS DEVELOP OVER TIME  YOU DONT INSTANTLY BECOME GOOD FRIENDS WITH SOMEONE  IT TAKES A WHILE  SOME OF MY FRIENDS IVE KNOWN FOR YEARS BUT HAVENT STARTED ACTUALLY BEING FRIENDS WITH UNTIL THIS YEAR  FRIENDSHIPS ARE NOT ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON SHARING EXTREMELY SIMILAR PERSONALITIES  IM A QUIET LIBERAL WHO ISNT THE MOST SOCIAL PERSON ON THE PLANET WHILE A LOT OF MY FRIENDS ARE VERY TALKATIVE CONSERVATIVES WHO ARE INCREDIBLY SOCIAL  IT DOESNT MATTER  WERE FRIENDS BECAUSE WERE DIFFERENT  BECAUSE IF WE WERE ALL SIMILAR IT WOULD BE LIKE TALKING TO YOURSELF ALL OF THE TIME AND THAT WOULD BECOME MADDENING ANON FROM GERMANTOWN  MD  PREFERS FRIENDS WITH DIFFERENT OPINIONS I HAPPEN TO GO FROM FRIEND TO FRIEND  NOT HAVING A PERMANENT GROUP  HOWEVER  THE PEOPLE I HAPPEN TO BE FRIENDS WITH ALWAYS HAVE CHARACTERISTICS SIMILAR TO MY OWN  HUMOR  FOR ONE  IS A DRIVING FACTOR IN WHO I LOOK TO SEEK COMPANIONSHIP FROM  I BELIEVE ITS IMPORTANT TO SURROUND YOURSELF WITH DIFFERENT OPINIONS  SO YOU WONT SHROUD YOURSELF IN A BUBBLE  AND SO YOU CAN GROW AS A PERSON  I AM NOT VERY SURPRISED TO SEE A SCIENTIFIC CORRELATION  BECAUSE THERE MUST BE SOME REASON AS TO WHY I AM DRAWN TO SPECIFIC PEOPLE  SPECIFICALLY THOSE OF THE OPPOSITE GENDER WHO ARE AROUND MY AGE AND HAVE SIMILAR BUT NOT EXACTLY THE SAME SOCIOECONOMIC CONDITIONS JIWON LEE FROM CA SHARES COMMON ATTRIBUTES AND BACKGROUND WITH FRIENDS MY FRIENDS AND I ARE VERY ALIKE IN A WAY OF BEING INDECISIVE AND INNOCENT  ALSO  WE ALL ARE ASIANS  SOPHOMORES  AND SHORT WE HAVE ALMOST SAME HEIGHTS  WE ARE INTERESTED IN ASIAN FOOD AND CULTURE  SINCE I HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE VERY SIMILAR TO ME IN TERMS OF PERSONALITY  INTERESTS  APPEARANCE  AND EDUCATIONAL LEVEL  I HAVE EXPECTED THAT A PERSONS FRIENDS WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THE PERSON IN PERSONALITY OR BACKGROUNDS  BUT I NEVER KNEW THAT FRIENDS HAVE SIMILAR BRAIN ACTIVITIES  I THOUGHT THAT WAY BECAUSE WE BECAME FRIENDS AFTER SOME TIME WE MET FOR THE FIRST TIME  I DONT THINK WE REALLY HAD ANY INSTANT CHEMISTRY WITH MY BEST FRIENDS  I DONT REMEMBER WHY  BUT WE STARTED HAVING LUNCHES TOGETHER AT SOME POINT  THEN  WE SOMEHOW CONTINUED OUR AWKWARD CONVERSATIONS AND FOUND OUT WHAT WE HAVE IN COMMON  THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING SIMILAR FRIENDS IS THAT WE COULD KEEP TALKING CONSTANTLY ABOUT MANY TOPICS BECAUSE WE USUALLY TALK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE ALL INTERESTED IN AND KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT  HOWEVER  HAVING SIMILAR FRIENDS DOES NOT HELP VERY MUCH ABOUT EXTENDING MY KNOWLEDGE OR VIEWS BECAUSE I WOULDNT GET TO HEAR DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES  ON THE OTHER HAND  I COULD LEARN A LOT FROM FRIENDS WHO ARE NOT SIMILAR TO ME  BUT I OFTEN FEEL OVERWHELMED WHEN THEY EXPLAIN SO MUCH INFORMATION TO ME  AND I DONT UNDERSTAND MOST OF THEIR EXPLANATION RACHEL LONG FROM WEKIVA HIGH SCHOOL REMEMBERS BONDING RIGHT AWAY I TEND TO SEE PATTERNS WITH MY CLOSEST FRIENDS WITH THE WAY WE BEHAVE  THE WAY WE SPEAK  OUR FACIAL EXPRESSIONS AND MANNERISMS  BUT THIS IS ALL AFTER WE HAVE BEEN VERY CLOSE FOR A WHILE  I HAVE A VERY LARGE AND DIVERSE FRIEND GROUP BUT ONE COMMONALITY THAT I KNOW WE ALL SHARE IS DETERMINATION AND DRIVE TO SUCCEED AND SIMILAR MENTALITIES WHEN IT COMES TO SCHOOL AND SPORTS ALIKE  THE FACT THAT MY FRIENDS AND I ARE SO ALIKE IN THIS WAY CAUSES US TO PUSH EACH OTHER TO BE OUR BEST SELVES  INSTEAD OF ALLOWING EACH OTHER TO JUST BE GOOD  HOWEVER  SOMETIMES THIS BECOMES MORE OF A COMPETITION THAN MOTIVATION  WHILE NOT ALL OF MY FRIENDS ARE MY BEST FRIEND  THE PEOPLE THAT I CONSIDER MY BEST FRIENDS ARE THE LEAST LIKE ME  THEY WERE EASY TO CONNECT WITH AND WE DIDNT JUDGE EACH OTHER UPON FIRST MEETING  WE WERE ABLE TO BOND RIGHT AWAY KAYLA RENEE FROM PENNSYLVANIA LIKES DIFFERENCES ME AND MY FRIENDS ARE SIMILAR  I WOULDNT USE THE WORD ALIKE  BEING EXACTLY LIKE YOUR FRIENDS IS BORING  BECAUSE EVENTUALLY YOU LEARN THEIR EVERY MOVE  MY FRIENDS AND I DONT ALWAYS SEE EYE TO EYE ON EVERYTHING BUT FOR THE MOST PART WE HAVE THE SAME TASTES IN MUSIC AND ENJOY THE SAME ACTIVITIES  NO TWO FRIENDS SHOULD BE EXACTLY ALIKE OR ENJOY EVERYTHING TOGETHER  FRIENDS ARGUE AND DISAGREE ALL THE TIME  WITHOUT OUR DIFFERENCES WED ALL BE  ORDINARY JORDYN IVES FROM WESTFIELD  N J  AGREES DIFFERENCE MAKES FRIENDSHIP INTERESTING I SHARE THE SAME CORE VALUES WITH ALL OF MY FRIENDS  WHAT BRINGS US TOGETHER IS OUR OVERALL TRUST THAT WE HAVE WITH EACH OTHER  AND AN UNDERSTANDING THAT GOES BEYOND SIMPLE THINGS  WE ALL VALUE HONESTY  KINDNESS  GRADES AND MOST OF ALL LOYALTY  WHILE AT THE CENTER  WE ALL VERY MUCH SIMILAR  THERE IS LITTLE OVERLAP IN OUR PERSONALITIES AND INTERESTS  EVERYBODY IN MY GROUP HAS DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THEY ARE INVOLVED IN  THAT IS WHAT MAKES US INTERESTING  IF EVERYBODY WAS THE SAME  THE WORLD WOULD BE A VERY BORING PLACE  SOME OF MY FRIENDS LIKE SPORTS  OTHERS ART AND WRITING  BUT NO MATTER HOW DIFFERENT WE ARE  WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS THAT WE ALL SHARE A MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING  AND HAVE SIMILAR VALUES ABOVE ALL ELSE STUDENTS RESPONDED TO THE QUESTION ARE YOU CONFORMING TO OR REBELLING AGAINST YOUR PARENTS WISHES FOR YOU  WITH DETAILS OF THEIR HOPES AND DREAMS JESSICA LEE FROM WILMINGTON  N C  KNOWS HER PARENTS HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS  BUT TRUSTS THEM WHAT MY PARENTS WANT IS WHATS BEST FOR ME  ITS WHAT THEYVE ALWAYS WANTED  IVE NEVER HAD TO REBEL AGAINST MY PARENTS BECAUSE WE WANT THE SAME THINGS  I LONG TO BE A DOCTOR WHEN I GROW UP  AND THEY SUPPORT ME  MAYBE ITS BECAUSE THEYRE DOCTORS TOO  BEING HALF ASIAN  I KNOW THE STRUGGLES THAT THE AUTHOR POINTS OUT  BUT I DO REALIZE THAT MY PARENTS HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS NOT BECAUSE OF MY BACKGROUND  BUT BECAUSE OF ME  IT SOUNDS LIKE THE AUTHOR HAD NUMEROUS TOXIC FIGHTS WITH HER PARENTS  WHICH IS NOT THE CASE IN MY FAMILY  MY PARENTS ONLY PUSH ME TO DO WHAT THEY KNOW I CAN DO  ALTHOUGH I KNOW THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH OTHER FAMILIES I TALK TO MY PARENTS ABOUT MY FUTURE KNOWING THAT THEY KNOW MORE THAN I DO  I WANT TO GO INTO THE SAME FIELD AS THEM  SO I ASK IF THEY COULD DO IT OVER AGAIN  WHAT PROFESSION WOULD THEY GO INTO  I THINK I AM MORE LIKE MY DAD  BUT I CAN RELATE TO MY MOM TOO  SEEING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MY FAMILY AND THE AUTHORS FAMILY WIDENS MY PERSPECTIVE ABOUT AMERICAN EXPECTATIONS  I THINK THAT AS LONG AS A CHILD KNOWS THAT THEIR PARENTS WANT WHATS BEST FOR THEM  ITS EASIER FOR BOTH SIDES TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER I LOVE AND TRUST MY PARENTS  AND WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE OF THEIR EXPECTATIONS  I AM GRATEFUL THAT THEY ARE OPEN ABOUT MY ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND DECISIONS  ITS IMPORTANT TO FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN EXPECTATIONS AND OPEN MINDEDNESS ASHTON H FROM NC BOTH CONFORMS AND REBELS PARENTS  HOPEFULLY  WANT THE BEST FOR THEIR CHILD  HOWEVER  WHAT THE PARENT WANTS MAY NOT BE WHAT CHILD WANTS OR EVEN WHAT THE CHILD NEEDS  PERSONALLY  I FALL IN BETWEEN REBELLING AND CONFORMING  I TRY NOT TO DO ANYTHING THAT WOULD HORRIBLY UPSET THEM  BUT I ALSO WONT BACK DOWN  THERE ARE SOME THINGS ABOUT ME THAT ARE JUST PART OF WHO I AM  WHETHER OR NOT PARENTS WANT TO ACCEPT IT  MOST OF MY CHOICES DO UPSET THEM  AND DEFINITELY CONFUSE THEM  AND MOST OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT WHAT IS MORE WIDELY ACCEPTED TODAY BY THE WORLD WAS NOT WHAT WAS WIDELY ACCEPTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF THEIR LIVES  THESE DECISIONS DO AFFECT MY RELATIONSHIP QUITE A BIT  AND HAVE SINCE CAUSED A LOT OF STRESS AND STRIFE  BUT IN THE END  IT IS MY LIFE  IM NOT INTERESTED IN BREAKING LAWS OR HURTING ANYONE  I JUST WANT TO BE MYSELF THE PARENTS OF JORDYN IVES FROM WESTFIELD  N J  HAVE ONE RULE MY PARENTS WANT ME TO DO SOMETHING WITH MY LIFE THAT IS MY CHOICE  BUT THERE IS ONE CONTENDER  I MUST BE ABLE TO SUPPORT MYSELF  AFTER COLLEGE  I MUST BE ABLE TO LIVE ON MY OWN AND MAINTAIN A JOB  I HAVE TO MAJOR IN SOMETHING THAT HAS GREAT JOB PROSPECTS  SO I CAN GO OUT INTO THE REAL WORLD  I AM CONFIDENT THAT WHATEVER CAREER I CHOOSE  MY PARENTS WILL SUPPORT ME  THEIR ULTIMATE WISH IS THAT I PURSUE A CAREER IN SOMETHING THAT I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT  I AM GOING TO FOLLOW MY PARENTS GUIDANCE WHEN IT COMES TIME TO PICK A MAJOR  BECAUSE THE LAST THING I WANT IS TO BE OUT OF COLLEGE  AND MY PARENTS ARE SAYING I TOLD YOU SO VERONICA FROM KAPLONS PARENTS HAVE BECOME MORE INVOLVED IN HER PLANS OVER THE YEARS TRUTH BE TOLD  MY PARENTS WHO I LOVE DEARLY ARE SOMEWHAT PARADOXICAL CHARACTERS  THE YOUNGER I WAS  THE MORE FREEDOM I HAD WHEN IT CAME TO MY FUTURE  DENTIST

ME AWAY FROM THE INEVITABLE HORRORS WHICH AWAIT ME  HOW DO WE ENGAGE IN THESE DEEP  ANALYTICAL  THOUGHT PROVOKING CONSERVATIONS ABOUT MY FUTURE  FOR NOW  THERE IS NOTHING A GOOD MOVIE CANT FIX SOME STUDENTS ALSO MAKE SUGGESTIONS FOR HOW TO HAVE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS WITH PARENTS  ROSIE FROM OXFORD  MISS  THINKS YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD STAND UP FOR WHAT THEY WANT SOME OF MY DECISIONS ARE WAY OFF OF MY PARENTS WISHES AND DECISIONS  BOTH OF MY PARENTS ARE LAWYERS AND BOTH OF MY GRANDFATHERS ARE LAWYERS  MY DAD  I BELIEVE  WOULD LIKE MY SIBLINGS OR I TO TAKE OVER ONE OF THE FAMILIES BUSINESSES  I WOULD LIKE TO BE AN OPHTHALMOLOGIST  WHICH IS MY DREAM JOB  MY PARENTS AGREE WITH ME ON THAT  BUT THEY SOMETIMES DISAGREE WITH ME ON THE LITTLE THINGS  ALL IN ALL  MY PARENTS LOVE ME VERY MUCH  THEY RESPECT ME AND MY DECISIONS TOO  EVEN IF MY DECISIONS ARE NOT WHAT THEY WANT FOR ME  OTHERS SHOULD CONFRONT THEIR PARENTS  AND SAY THEY ARE SET ON THIS PARTICULAR THING  IF NOT  YOU COULD BE FORCED

PLANS  I LIKE KNOWING DEFINITIVELY WHAT IM GOING TO DO  WHEN IM GOING TO DO IT  AND WHERE  THE PLANS CHANGED AS I GREW UP   WHEN I WAS ELEVEN  I WANTED TO BE A VETERINARIAN  AND THEN I REALIZED ID HAVE TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERY ANIMAL  WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN  I WANTED TO BE A BARN MANAGER  AND THEN I REALIZED ID MAKE NEXT TO NOTHING  NOW  IM SEVENTEEN  AND I WANT TO BE AN OT AND LIVE IN NEW

YEAR OLD WILL FORGET  POINTED OUT THE SHARP EDGE OF REALITY WHEN MY HEAD WAS IN THE CLOUDS  MY MOM TAUGHT ME COMPASSION AND EMPATHY  AND I TOOK THOSE LESSONS AND RAN WITH THEM  AND NOW I HOPE MY LIFE REVOLVES AROUND THOSE THINGS  SHE IS HARDLY EVER CONFUSED OR ANGRY ABOUT DECISIONS I MAKE   IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO RELATE TO KIDS WHO PANICKED OVER FLUNKING TESTS BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS WOULD KILL THEM AND ALEC BARDEN FROM WILMINGTON  N C  RECOMMENDS INVITING ONES PARENTS INTO THE CONVERSATION PERSONALLY  I AM CONFORMING TO MY PARENTS  YOUR PARENTS ARE THE ONES THAT YOU LIVE WITH UNTIL YOU GO OFF TO COLLEGE  THEY PROVIDE A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD AND FOOD ON THE TABLE  YOUR PARENTS PAY FOR COLLEGE AND TEACH YOU VALUABLE LIFE LESSONS  I AM VERY RESPECTFUL TOWARDS MY PARENTS AT ALL TIMES AS FOR THE ARTICLE  WHEN MS  KUO WRITES INVITE YOUR PARENTS INTO THE CONVERSATION  LET THEM BELIEVE THEY ARE HELPING TO GUIDE YOU  OFFER INFORMATION THAT MIGHT PERSUADE THEM  MENTION OLDER PEOPLE WHOM YOU HAVE CONSULTED  SPELLING OUT THEIR PATHS I FULLY AGREE WITH HER  COMMUNICATING AND INTERACTING WITH YOUR PARENTS IS SOMETHING THAT I HAVE ALWAYS DONE  I KNOW MANY TEENAGERS THAT BASICALLY IGNORE THEIR PARENTS  I BELIEVE THAT IS VERY DISRESPECTFUL  DEVELOPING A WEAK RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KIDS AND THEIR PARENTS STUDENTS SHARE THE PLACES THAT ACT AS THE PUBLIC SQUARE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES IN RESPONSE TO OUR PICTURE PROMPT JORDYN IVES FROM WESTFIELD  N J  GATHERS WITH FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS DOWNTOWN IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD  THE DOWNTOWN AREA ACTS AS A GATHERING PLACE FOR THE COMMUNITY  AFTER SCHOOL  STUDENTS FROM BOTH MIDDLE SCHOOLS FLOCK TO THE CENTER OF TOWN  LINES ARE FORMED OUTSIDE OF THE LOCAL DRUG STORE WHERE PENNY CANDY IS SOLD  STARBUCKS  THE ARCADE AND PIZZA RESTAURANTS WHERE SLICES CAN BE BOUGHT FOR UNDER 2 BUCKS  THE RESTAURANTS THAT LINE OUR STREETS ARE GREAT FOR FAMILIES TOO  ALONG WITH THE LARGE PARK SITUATED IN THE MIDDLE OF TOWN  IT IS THE DOWNTOWN AREA THAT REALLY MAKES OUR COMMUNITY WHAT IT IS  I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR IT  AND ALTHOUGH I MAY TAKE THIS LUXURY FOR GRANTED  I TRULY AM AMAZED AT HOW WONDERFUL IT FEELS LIKE TO LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD WITH AN EXCELLENT DOWNTOWN AREA XANDER KRUVCZUK FROM THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THINKS SOCIAL MEDIA HAS MADE PUBLIC GATHERING PLACES LESS COMMON IT MY HOMETOWN  THE PLACE WHERE ALL MY FRIENDS STILL MEET UP AT IS THE MOVIE THEATER  WHENEVER A MOVIE THAT WE ALL WANT TO SEE IS PLAYING  WE SCHEDULE A TIME AND GO TO SEE IT  OTHER THAN THAT THOUGH  WE NEVER REALLY HANG OUT OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL  I FEEL LIKE ONLINE COMMUNICATION HAS DIMINISHED THE AMOUNT OF PLACES SUCH AS THESE  I CAN EASILY SEE HOW WAFFLE HOUSE WOULD BE A GOOD MEETING PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO GATHER  THE ONLY BAD PART ABOUT WAFFLE HOUSE IS THAT THERE ARE NONE IN THE NORTHEAST  ITS SUCH A GREAT PLACE TO BE WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS OUR STUDENT OPINION PROMPT DO YOU GAMIFY YOUR LIFE  ASKS STUDENTS IF THEY TRACK ANY NUMBERS RELATED ASPECT OF THEIR LIVES  LIKE HOURS SLEPT OR STEPS TAKEN EACH DAY ZECH EDWARDS FROM NEVADA  TEXAS  SAYS COMPETITION IS THE REASON WHY SOME PEOPLE GAMIFY AS OF NOW  I DO NOT RELATE TO ANYTHING THAT MR  YAGODA DOES BUT DO RELATE TO THE IDEAS HE ADDRESSES  I THINK THE REASON PEOPLE MAY HAVE THESE TENDENCIES BECAUSE IN TODAYS AGE  EVERYONE IS COMPETITIVE  AND  BEING COMPETITIVE MYSELF IN LIFE  REALIZE IT MAKE SENSE TO RELATE IT TO A VIDEO GAME  MY SMALL TRIUMPHS CONSIST OF GETTING BETTER GRADES THAN A FRIEND ON A TEST OR BEATING SOMEONE IN A RACE OR LIFTING MORE THAN SOMEONE  I AM NOT SURPRISED AT THE EXTENT TO WHICH MR  YAGODA GAMIFYS HIS EVERYDAY LIFE  BECAUSE  WHILE I DO NOT RELATE IT TO GAMES  I DO COMPETE WITH THOSE AROUND ME AND SET GOALS IN THE SAME WAY LILIANA R FROM TEXAS THINKS IT IS FUN I DO IDENTIFY WITH THE HABITS AND BEHAVIORS THAT YAGODA DESCRIBES  ITS POSSIBLE PEOPLE DO THIS TO HAVE FUN WITH LIFE  AND LOOK AT IT LIKE A LEVEL IN A GAME  SOMETIMES WHEN IM IN THE CAR ILL IMAGINE SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS AROUND ME IN THE BUILDINGS OR FIELDS I SEE CHANDLER ROSS FROM TEXAS SEES THE PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS I SEE WHERE MR  YOGODA IS COMING FROM IN HIS ARTICLE  MANY PEOPLE PLAN TO OR EVEN CARRY THROUGH WITH MAPPING OUT THEIR DAYS OR EVEN WEEKS SO THAT THEY STAY ON TRACK  EXAMPLE IS SOME FAMILIES MAKE A WEEK MEAL MENU 1  SO THEY KNOW WHAT EACH DAY OF THE WEEK THEY ARE EATING AND 2  SO THEY CAN BUT JUST THINGS ON THEIR LIST FROM THE GROCERY STORE TO MAKE THOSE MEALS AND NOT BUY EXTRA ITEMS THEY DONT NEED JAZMINE FROM TEXAS TRACKS SCHOOL GRADES I PERSONALLY DO NOT IDENTIFY MYSELF WITH THE HABITS AND BEHAVIORS SHE DESCRIBES  BY GAMIFY SHE MEANS BY TRACKING NUMBERS OF ANY SORT  SUCH AS YOUR WEIGHT GAIN  YOUR ELECTRIC BILL  AND YOUR GRADES FOR SCHOOL  THE ONLY THING I REALLY TEND TO GAMIFY IS MY SCHOOL GRADES  BECAUSE IF I GAMIFY EVERYTHING ELSE IT WOULD BECOME A HASSLE OF TIME AND WOULD BECOME AN ENERGY DRAINER JORDYN IVES FROM WESTFIELD  N J  THINKS NUMBERS ENHANCE REALITY BY GAMIFYING LIFE  ONCE REMEDIAL TASKS  LIKE GOING TO CVS OR TAKING A SHOWER BECOME ADVENTURES  NUMBERS ARE A WAY TO ENHANCE REALITY  ADDING EXCITEMENT TO PLACES THAT NEED THEM MOST  I CAN IDENTIFY WITH MR  YAGODAS PLIGHT  BECAUSE I DO THE SAME ON AN ALMOST DAILY BASIS  WHEN I AM IN SCHOOL  I OFTEN CREATE A HAND WRITING COMPETITION BETWEEN MY RIGHT AND LEFT HANDS  CONSIDERING THAT I AM A RIGHTY  THAT HAND ALWAYS WINS  BUT NEVERTHELESS I STILL LIKE TO KEEP SCORE  IN MY HEAD I PLAY GEOGRAPHY TRIVIA WITH MYSELF  THINKING OF A RANDOM COUNTRY THAN TRYING TO SAY THE CAPITAL  BELIEVE ME  IT MAKES THOSE BORING MOMENTS GO BY IN A HEARTBEAT  IF IT WAS FOR THE GAMES THAT I PLAY WITH MYSELF  LIFE WOULD BE A LOT LESS FUN  THEY ARE NOT JUST A WAY TO PASS TIME  BUT TO ENRICH IT MACKENZIE BOONE FROM WILMINGTON  N C  SAYS GAMES FIGHT BOREDOM EVER SINCE I WAS LITTLE I HAVE HATED BEING BORED IN THE CAR  CONSIDERING MY FAMILY TAKES MANY A ROAD TRIP  I STARTED PRETENDING MY HAND WAS ON AN OBSTACLE COURSE  I WOULD JUMP AND RUN ON TELEPHONE LINES  AND HAVE TO BLINK IN BETWEEN EVERY WHITE LINE ON THE ROAD  IT WOULD KEEP ME OCCUPIED FOR A WHILE  BUT EVENTUALLY ID GET BORED AND WANT TO STOP  BUT I NEVER COULD  ID GET THIS STRONG AND REALLY STRANGE FEELING THAT IF I DIDNT FINISH THE GAME MY CHARACTER WOULD DIE  WHICH MANIFESTED ITSELF INTO A WEIRD GAME I COULDNT WIN  OBVIOUSLY THIS ISNT THE SAME AS MAKING WEIGHT LOSS A GAME  OR TURNING A CVS INTO A BATTLEGROUND  BUT IM SAYING I UNDERSTAND THE FASCINATION AND INNATE DESIRE FOR SEEMINGLY POINTLESS OR BORING JOURNEYS TO HAVE A PURPOSE  WINNING AND LOSING ARE FEELINGS THAT CREATE DRIVE  TO ACHIEVE OR AVOID AND I DONT THINK ITS STRANGE TO LIVE BY THAT EVEN IN THE MOST SIMPLE TASKS STUDENTS COMMENTED ON OUR PICTURE PROMPT PROCRASTINATING WITH THEIR POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE WORK HABITS MACKENZIE BOONE FROM WILMINGTON  N C  IS A MAJOR PROCRASTINATOR I THINK EVERY PROCRASTINATOR BELIEVES THEY ARE THE WORST PROCRASTINATOR  WHICH IS EXACTLY HOW I FEEL  MY PROCRASTINATION HABITS WERE ONCE A THING THAT LEFT ME TO COMPLETE MY WORK IN A SPUR OF CREATIVITY  WHENEVER THE MOMENT FELT RIGHT BUT ITS GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE I SIT AND I WAIT FOR SOME CREATIVE IDEA TO HIT  IT NEVER COMES  AND ME BEING SO DETERMINED TO DO MY BEST  I JUST DONT DO IT  OR WHEN IT COMES TO STUDYING WHICH REQUIRES NO CREATIVITY  I FEEL THE NEED TO WAIT FOR PANIC TO SET IN TO MOTIVATE ME BUT USUALLY MY PANIC BECOMES SO OVERWHELMING I IGNORE IT LIKE I IGNORE THE LOOMING WORLD WAR  THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE PROJECTS THOUGH  THAT I HAVE DONE THE NIGHT BEFORE INVOLVING SOME ARTISTIC THEME THAT WERE  NOT TO BRAG  BUT IM GOING TO BRAG  SOME OF THE BEST IN THE CLASS  WHICH DOESNT HELP ME IN TRUTH BECAUSE THEN I FOOL MYSELF INTO BELIEVING PROCRASTINATION WILL ALWAYS BENEFIT ME  WHICH I KNOW ISNT TRUE BUT I STILL SOMEHOW STAND BY THAT FACT  SO MAYBE MY PROCRASTINATION HABITS WILL DESTROY MY ACADEMIC LIFE AND MY FUTURE TO COME  BUT ILL CROSS THAT BRIDGE WHEN I COME TO IT BUT BETZABETH4D FROM YC CLIP LIKES TO GET THINGS DONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE MOST OF THE TIME I WOULD SAID I FEEL MYSELF AS A PRE CRASTINATOR  I HATE WHEN I HAVE TO FINISH ANY TASK AND I CANNOT DO IT FOR SORT OF REASON  IN MY PERSONAL OPINION PROCRASTINATE A TASK IS A WASTE OF THE TIME  IF I FINISH SOMETHING  I BELIEVE I CAN ENJOY THE FREE TIME THAT I HAVE WITHOUT ANY WORRIES  OR ALSO I CAN START A NEW TASK WITHOUT HAVE TO THINK IN THE OTHER ONE  HOWEVER AFTER READ THIS ARTICLE ITS MAKE ME THINK IN A DIFFERENT WAY  I NEVER THOUGH PROCRASTINATION COULD BE VERY HELPFUL WHEN YOU ARE PLANNING ABOUT TO BE CREATIVE GIANCARLO4D FROM YC CLIP FALLS IN BETWEEN I AM SOMETHING IN BETWEEN  SOMETIMES WHEN I HAVE TIME  I DECIDE TO DO THE WORK EARLY  BUT WHEN MY FRIENDS CALL ME  I DECIDE TO PROCRASTINATE A LITTLE BIT JUST TO HAVE FUN  PROCRASTINATING MAKES US REDUCE STRESS  HOWEVER  PROCRASTINATION IS IN THEORY BAD  BECAUSE WE LEAVE OUR WORK TO THE END  MOST OF THE TIME WE DO NOT END DOING OUR DUTY  I FEEL SO BAD WITH MY HABITS BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE TOO ENOUGH TIME TO DO MY PERSONAL THINGS  FOR EXAMPLE GOING OUT WITH FRIENDS  ENJOYING WITH MY FAMILY OR EXERCISING  I ONLY THINK ABOUT WORK AND STUDY  I THINK THAT I HAVE TO CHANGE MY HABITS AND CREATE A LITTLE SPACE FOR MYSELF  POSTPONE A PROJECT TO THE LAST MINUTE DOES NOT MAKE A BETTER JOB BECAUSE YOU HAVE LESS TIME TO RESEARCH AND TO CORRECT ERRORS  IN MY EXPERIENCE  IT IS BETTER TO DO OUR DUTY IN THE BEGINNING THAN PROCRASTINATE  IF YOU DO NOT DO WELL AND HAVE MANY ERRORS ONE PROJECT THAT IS EVALUATED IN THOUSANDS DOLLARS  MAY BE DEVALUED TO ONLY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS SOME STUDENTS ARE FRUSTRATED BY THEIR PROCRASTINATION HABITS  LIKE REX HARDY FROM WILMINGTON  N C I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A PROCRASTINATOR AND IT SEEMS A PROBLEM IM NEVER GOING TO SOLVE IT ALL STARTED BACK IN THE 4TH GRADE WITH MRS  MCCULLOUGH  I HAD BEEN ASSIGNED MY FIRST BIG PROJECT  THE NOTORIOUS SCIENCE FAIR PROJECT  NOT REALLY KNOWING HOW MUCH TIME IT WOULD TAKE  I WAITED AND WAITED UNTIL THE NIGHT BEFORE IT WAS DUE  I STAYED UP TIL 1 OR 2 IN THE MORNING  WHICH WAS FAR PAST MY 7 30 BEDTIME LITTLE DID I KNOW THAT THIS WOULD BE THE ROUTINE FOR EVERY PROJECT AND TEST FOR THE REST OF MY SCHOOL CAREER  IVE TRIED MANY TIMES TO BREAK THIS HABIT  YET I CANT  THE BEST IVE DONE IS A TEMPORARY FIX THAT LASTED FOR ABOUT A COUPLE OF WEEKS  NEW YEARS RESOLUTIONS  WORDS FOR THE YEAR  AND FAR IN ADVANCE PLANNING HASNT DONE THE TRICK  NOW  PROCRASTINATION DOESNT MEAN ALL IVE GOTTEN IS BAD GRADES  IN FACT  THAT SCIENCE FAIR PROJECT WAS PICKED 3RD IN MY SCHOOL AND WAS CHOSEN TO COMPETE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL  IN REALITY  I GOT AWAY WITH PROCRASTINATION ALL THROUGH ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOL  THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR PROCRASTINATION HAS REALLY KICKED ME IN THE BUTT  LIKE MY MOM HAS TOLD ME ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS  THE WORK IS ONLY GOING TO GET HARDER AND HARDER AND THIS HABIT ISNT GOING TO WORK  I SHOULDVE LISTENED A LONG TIME AGO AND I PROBABLY WOULDNT BE SITTING WITH A B AVERAGE IN AP WORLD OR STAYING UP TONIGHT TO FINISH MULTIPLE ASSIGNMENTS  I KNOW SOMETHING HAS GOT TO CHANGE OR MY DREAMS OF MAKING IT TO A BIG TIME COLLEGE WILL BE GONE EVENTUALLY ILL FIGURE IT OUT  RIGHT BUT OTHERS SEE THE BENEFITS OF PUTTING THINGS OFF UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE  JONATHON CALKINS FROM ST  CLOUD  FLA  SAYS IT CAN HELP WITH MEMORY I AM ALSO A PROCRASTINATOR  PROCRASTINATING IS OFTEN SEEN AS A NEGATIVE THING  I  ON THE OTHER HAND  SEE IT VERY DIFFERENTLY  I BELIEVE THAT I PERFORM MY BEST WHEN I WORK UNDER THE PRESSURE OF A TIME CONSTRAINT  FROM STUDYING LAST MINUTE  THINGS TEND TO STAY FRESH IN MY BRAIN ALLOWING ME TO REMEMBER THINGS BETTER  WHEN I STUDY OR DO MY HOMEWORK WITHOUT PROCRASTINATING I OFTEN FIND MYSELF DAYDREAMING OR GETTING DISTRACTED TO EASILY  PROCRASTINATING HAS GOTTEN ME THIS FAR IN SCHOOL SO I MIGHT AS WELL KEEP IT GOING ANDREA HERNANDEZ FROM SAINT CLOUD  FLA  FEELS MORE FOCUSED UNDER PRESSURE IT COULD BE TWO IN THE MORNING AND ILL STILL FIND AN EXCUSE TO NOT COMPLETE AN ESSAY DUE THE NEXT DAY  IN FACT  ILL JUST PUT IT ASIDE AND SET AN ALARM FOR 5 00A M  THE SOUND GOES OFF  BLARING IN MY EARS AND THE FEELING OF REGRET IMMEDIATELY SETTLES IN  I CONTEMPLATE MY LIFE AND ALL THE HORRIBLE DECISIONS IVE MADE LEADING UP TO THIS MISERY  YET I ALWAYS SEEM TO BE THE MOST FOCUSED UNDER PRESSURE  KNOWING THE JOB NEEDS TO GET DONE UNDER A TIME CONSTRAINT ALLOWS ME TO GIVE MY UNDIVIDED ATTENTION TO THE TASK AT HAND  DISREGARDING ALL DISTRACTIONS SURROUNDING ME  AS MUCH AS I HATE HAVING TO PROCRASTINATE  IT HAS SERVED ME WELL ALL ALONG AND HUBERNEY4D FROM YC CLIP IS MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIMENT I AM CERTAINLY SURE THAT I AM A PROCRASTINATOR  I OFTEN FEEL FRUSTRATED WHEN GETTING CLOSE TO A DEADLINE  BECAUSE I HAD WASTED TIME IN MEANINGLESS ACTIONS JUST FOR ENTERTAINMENT OR LEISURE WITHOUT COMPLETING OR EVEN STARING AN IMPORTANT WORK OR TASK  I DO NOT THINK PROCRASTINATING HAS A BRIGHT SIDE  PROCRASTINATION MAKES YOU WASTE VALUED TIME YOU COULD USE PERFORMING AN IMPORTANT TASK  ALTHOUGH  I HAD BEEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE MY LIMITED TIME CAUSED BY PROCRASTINATING FORCE ME TO TAKE RISKS  I WOULD NOT TAKE OTHERWISE  AS WHEN I WAS  TAKING PAINTING CLASSES AND VERY OFTEN MY PROCRASTINATION HABITS BROUGHT ME TO THE DEADLINE WITH AN EMPTY CANVAS  IN THOSE MOMENTS IN ORDER TO FINISH MY PAINTING IN ONE NIGHT  I EXPERIMENTED WITH DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES THAT SOMETIMES HELPED ME NOT ONLY FINISH FASTER MY PAINTING  BUT ALSO LEAVING GOOD RESULTS
20180504,politics,north korea,6,WASHINGTON  PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ORDERED THE PENTAGON TO PREPARE OPTIONS FOR DRAWING DOWN AMERICAN TROOPS IN SOUTH KOREA  JUST WEEKS BEFORE HE HOLDS A LANDMARK MEETING WITH NORTH KOREAS LEADER  KIM JONG UN  ACCORDING TO SEVERAL PEOPLE BRIEFED ON THE DELIBERATIONS REDUCED TROOP LEVELS ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE A BARGAINING CHIP IN MR  TRUMPS TALKS WITH MR  KIM ABOUT HIS WEAPONS PROGRAM  THESE OFFICIALS SAID  BUT THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT A PEACE TREATY BETWEEN THE TWO KOREAS COULD DIMINISH THE NEED FOR THE 28 500 SOLDIERS CURRENTLY STATIONED ON THE PENINSULA MR  TRUMP HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO WITHDRAW TROOPS FROM SOUTH KOREA  ARGUING THAT THE UNITED STATES IS NOT ADEQUATELY COMPENSATED FOR THE COST OF MAINTAINING THEM  THAT THE TROOPS ARE MAINLY PROTECTING JAPAN AND THAT DECADES OF AMERICAN MILITARY PRESENCE HAD NOT PREVENTED THE NORTH FROM BECOMING A NUCLEAR THREAT HIS LATEST PUSH COINCIDES WITH TENSE NEGOTIATIONS WITH SOUTH KOREA OVER HOW TO SHARE THE COST OF THE MILITARY FORCE  UNDER AN AGREEMENT THAT EXPIRES AT THE END OF 2018  SOUTH KOREA PAYS ABOUT HALF THE COST OF THE UPKEEP OF THE SOLDIERS  MORE THAN  MILLION A YEAR  THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS DEMANDING THAT IT PAY FOR VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE COST OF THE MILITARY PRESENCE THE DIRECTIVE HAS RATTLED OFFICIALS AT THE PENTAGON AND OTHER AGENCIES  WHO WORRY THAT ANY REDUCTION COULD WEAKEN THE AMERICAN ALLIANCE WITH SOUTH KOREA AND RAISE FEARS IN NEIGHBORING JAPAN AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT THE UNITED STATES IS EMBARKING ON A RISKY NUCLEAR NEGOTIATION WITH THE NORTH OFFICIALS DECLINED TO SAY WHETHER MR  TRUMP WAS SEEKING OPTIONS FOR A FULL OR PARTIAL REDUCTION OF TROOPS  THOUGH A FULL WITHDRAWAL WAS UNLIKELY  THEY EMPHASIZED THAT RETHINKING THE SIZE AND CONFIGURATION OF THE AMERICAN FORCE WAS OVERDUE  REGARDLESS OF THE SUDDEN FLOWERING OF DIPLOMACY WITH NORTH KOREA BUT MR  TRUMPS MEETING WITH MR  KIM INJECTS AN UNPREDICTABLE NEW ELEMENT  HIS ENTHUSIASM FOR THE ENCOUNTER  AND THE PROSPECT OF ENDING A NEARLY 70 YEAR OLD MILITARY CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TWO KOREAS  HAS RAISED CONCERNS THAT HE MAY OFFER TROOP CUTS IN RETURN FOR CONCESSIONS BY MR  KIM DEFENSE SECRETARY JIM MATTIS ADDED TO THOSE CONCERNS LAST FRIDAY WHEN HE SUGGESTED THAT THE FUTURE OF THE AMERICAN MILITARY PRESENCE MIGHT BE ON THE TABLE THATS PART OF THE ISSUES THAT WELL BE DISCUSSING IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH OUR ALLIES FIRST  AND OF COURSE WITH NORTH KOREA  HE SAID  FOR RIGHT NOW  WE JUST HAVE TO GO ALONG WITH PROCESS  HAVE THE NEGOTIATIONS AND NOT TRY TO MAKE PRECONDITIONS OR PRESUMPTIONS ABOUT HOW ITS GOING TO GO A SPOKESMAN FOR THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF  COL  PATRICK RYDER  SAID HE HAD NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOP OPTIONS BEING PREPARED FOR THE PRESIDENT FOR MR  TRUMP  WITHDRAWING TROOPS WOULD HAVE MULTIPLE BENEFITS  SAID VICTOR D  CHA  A KOREA SCHOLAR AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY WHO WAS FOR A TIME UNDER CONSIDERATION TO BE AMBASSADOR TO SEOUL  IT WOULD APPEAL TO HIS POLITICAL BASE  SAVE THE UNITED STATES MONEY AND GIVE HIM A VALUABLE CHIT IN HIS NEGOTIATION WITH MR  KIM BUT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE U S SOUTH KOREA ALLIANCE  MR  CHA SAID  IT WOULD REPRESENT A MAJOR RETRENCHMENT KELLY E  MAGSAMEN  A TOP ASIA POLICY OFFICIAL AT THE PENTAGON DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION  SAID  U S  PRESENCE IN SOUTH KOREA IS A SACROSANCT PART OF OUR ALLIANCE THE SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT REITERATED THIS WEEK THAT THE TROOPS WERE STILL NEEDED AND WOULD NOT BE PULLED OUT AS A RESULT OF A PEACE TREATY WITH NORTH KOREA  BUT EVEN CLOSE ALLIES OF PRESIDENT MOON JAE IN HAVE RAISED DOUBTS ABOUT THE RATIONALE FOR A LONG TERM AMERICAN PRESENCE WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO U S  FORCES IN SOUTH KOREA IF A PEACE TREATY IS SIGNED  MOON CHUNG IN  AN ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT  SAID IN A WIDELY READ ARTICLE PUBLISHED THIS WEEK  IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO JUSTIFY THEIR CONTINUING PRESENCE MR  KIM RECENTLY DECLARED  THROUGH SOUTH KOREAN OFFICIALS  THAT HE WOULD DROP THE NORTHS LONGSTANDING INSISTENCE THAT AMERICAN TROOPS LEAVE THE PENINSULA  SOME EXPERTS ARGUE THAT WATCHING AMERICAN SOLDIERS DEPART IS FAR LESS IMPORTANT TO HIM THAN WINNING RELIEF FROM ECONOMIC SANCTIONS FOR YEARS  THE AMERICAN PRESENCE HAS BEEN MORE IMPORTANT AS A SYMBOL OF DETERRENCE THAN AS A FIGHTING FORCE  AT THEIR CURRENT LEVELS  THE TROOP NUMBERS ARE DOWN BY ABOUT A THIRD FROM THE LEVEL IN THE 1990S AS THE SOUTH KOREANS HAVE BECOME A PREMIER FIGHTING FORCE  WITH THEIR OWN SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES  THE ABILITY TO OPPOSE THE NORTHS ARTILLERY ALONG THE DEMILITARIZED ZONE AND NOW THEIR OWN CYBERFORCES  THEY HAVE BECOME LESS DEPENDENT ON THE UNITED STATES  MOST AMERICAN TROOPS HAVE PULLED BACK TO WELL SOUTH OF SEOUL SINCE PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH REMOVED TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS FROM SOUTH KOREA IN THE EARLY 1990S  THE NUCLEAR DETERRENT AGAINST THE NORTH HAS BEEN BASED FAR AWAY  IN MISSILE SILOS ON THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES  SUBMARINES IN THE PACIFIC OR BOMBERS BASED ON GUAM MR  TRUMP IS NOT THE FIRST PRESIDENT TO PUSH FOR TROOP REDUCTIONS  JIMMY CARTER RAN FOR OFFICE ON A PROMISE TO WITHDRAW ALL GROUND COMBAT FORCES  IN PART TO PROTEST SOUTH KOREAS AUTOCRATIC GOVERNMENT AT THE TIME  RESISTANCE FROM THE MILITARY AND CONGRESS STYMIED HIS EFFORTS  IN 2004  GEORGE W  BUSHS DEFENSE SECRETARY  DONALD H  RUMSFELD  SHIFTED NEARLY 10 000 TROOPS FROM SOUTH KOREA TO THE IRAQ WAR DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION  FORMER OFFICIALS SAID  THE PENTAGON WAS ALWAYS RELUCTANT TO CONSIDER TROOP REDUCTIONS OR THE SUSPENSION OF JOINT MILITARY EXERCISES WHEN THE WHITE HOUSE TALKED ABOUT POTENTIAL PATHWAYS TO RIDDING NORTH KOREA OF ITS WEAPONS IT WOULD BE FOOLISH TO GIVE ANY OF THAT AWAY EARLY IN DISCUSSIONS  GIVEN THE LONG NORTH KOREAN TRACK RECORD OF BREAKING AGREEMENTS  SAID CHRISTINE WORMUTH  A FORMER TOP DEFENSE DEPARTMENT POLICY OFFICIAL IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION MR  TRUMP  HOWEVER  HAS LONG ARGUED THAT AMERICAS MILITARY PRESENCE IS NOT AN ASSET BUT A LIABILITY  NOT JUST IN SOUTH KOREA BUT IN JAPAN AS WELL  AS BOTH COUNTRIES BECAME WEALTHY  HE SAID  THEY SHOULD HAVE TAKEN ON MORE OF THE BURDEN FOR THEIR DEFENSE  DURING THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  HE EVEN SUGGESTED THAT THE TWO NATIONS ACQUIRE THEIR OWN NUCLEAR WEAPONS SO THEY DID NOT HAVE TO DEPEND ON THE AMERICAN NUCLEAR UMBRELLA GRUDGINGLY  MR  TRUMP ADMITTED THAT THE TROOPS HAD KEPT THE PEACE ON THE PENINSULA  BUT HE SAID THEY HAD NOT PREVENTED THE NORTH FROM ACQUIRING NUCLEAR WEAPONS OR MENACING ITS NEIGHBORS WEVE GOT OUR SOLDIERS SITTING THERE WATCHING MISSILES GO UP  HE SAID IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE NEW YORK TIMES IN JULY 2016  YOU SAY TO YOURSELF  WELL  WHAT ARE WE GETTING OUT OF THIS OVER THE PAST YEAR  OFFICIALS SAID  MR  TRUMP HAS CONTINUED TO QUESTION THE NEED FOR TROOPS WITH AIDES LIKE HIS FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER  LT  GEN  H  R  MCMASTER  AND HIS DEPUTY  MAJ  GEN  RICKY L  WADDELL BEFORE THE WINTER OLYMPICS IN PYEONGCHANG  WHEN TENSIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND NORTH KOREA WERE HIGH  THE PRESIDENT BROACHED THE IDEA OF WITHDRAWING THE DEPENDENTS OF TROOPS FROM SOUTH KOREA FOR SECURITY REASONS  HIS CHIEF OF STAFF  JOHN F  KELLY  TALKED HIM OUT OF THE PLAN  A FORMER OFFICIAL SAID  BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE STOKED FEARS OF AN IMMINENT MILITARY STRIKE AGAINST THE NORTH DURING THAT PERIOD  TENSIONS FLARED BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE PENTAGON BECAUSE MR  TRUMPS AIDES BELIEVED THE MILITARY WAS DRAGGING ITS FEET IN PROVIDING THE PRESIDENT WITH OPTIONS FOR A LIMITED STRIKE ON NORTH KOREA NOW  OFFICIALS SAID  THE SITUATION WAS REVERSED  THE PENTAGON WORRIES THAT MR  TRUMP WILL PUSH TOO SWIFTLY TO DEMILITARIZE
20180506,politics,politics,4,WASHINGTON  AS HE WEIGHS OPENING NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT NEGOTIATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA  PRESIDENT TRUMP FACES A REGIME THAT FOR DECADES HAS HIDDEN KEY ELEMENTS OF ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAMS FROM INTERNATIONAL MONITORS AND HAS BANNED INSPECTORS FROM THE COUNTRY AS A RESULT  THE FIRST STEP IN ANY MEANINGFUL AGREEMENT WOULD BE A DECLARATION FROM NORTH KOREA ABOUT THE SCOPE OF ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM  A DECLARATION THAT NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE FOLLOWED BY WHAT EXPERTS CALL THE MOST EXTENSIVE INSPECTION CAMPAIGN IN THE HISTORY OF NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT  ONE THAT WOULD HAVE TO DELVE INTO A PROGRAM THAT STRETCHES BACK MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY AND NOW COVERS SQUARE MILES OF INDUSTRIAL SITES AND HIDDEN TUNNELS ACROSS THE MOUNTAINOUS NORTH  AND IT MIGHT DEMAND MORE THAN THE 300 INSPECTORS THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY NOW DEPLOYS TO ASSESS THE NUCLEAR FACILITIES OF NEARLY 200 COUNTRIES FOR MR  TRUMP  GETTING THE RIGHT DECLARATION AND INSPECTION PROCESS IS CRITICAL GIVEN HIS ARGUMENT THAT FALSE DECLARATIONS FROM IRAN UNDERCUT THE LEGITIMACY OF THE 2015 NUCLEAR ACCORD  WHICH HE IS DEBATING PULLING OUT OF LATER THIS WEEK WHILE THERE IS NO QUESTION IRAN HID MUCH OF ITS WEAPONS DESIGNING PAST  NORTH KOREA HAS CONCEALED PROGRAMS ON A FAR LARGER SCALE AND BUILT AN ARSENAL OF 20 TO 60 NUCLEAR WARHEADS  COMPARED WITH NONE IN IRAN  IN FACT  THE IRAN INSPECTIONS  THE I A E A  SAYS  HAVE GONE ON WITHOUT A HITCH IN THE PAST TWO YEARS  THOUGH IT IS A FAR SMALLER  COMPARATIVELY EASIER EFFORT NORTH KOREA COULD MAKE IRAN LOOK EASY  ERNEST J  MONIZ  THE FORMER ENERGY DEPARTMENT SECRETARY AND NUCLEAR SCIENTIST WHO NEGOTIATED MANY DETAILS OF THE 2015 DEAL DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION  SAID LAST WEEK THIS ISNT TRUST  BUT VERIFY  HE SAID  USING PRESIDENT RONALD REAGANS PHRASE FROM ARMS CONTROL NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION  ITS DISTRUST EVERYTHING AND VERIFY  VERIFY  VERIFY SUCCESS WITH A RELATIVELY SMALL FORCE OF INSPECTORS IN NORTH KOREA  ACCORDING TO FORMER WEAPONS INSPECTORS  DEPENDS ON THE FULL COOPERATION OF ITS LEADER  KIM JONG UN  IN OPENING UP THE VAST NUCLEAR ENTERPRISE HE INHERITED FROM HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER FOUR YEARS AGO  THE RAND CORPORATION  WHICH OFTEN CONDUCTS STUDIES FOR THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT  ESTIMATED THAT FINDING AND SECURING THE NORTHS WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION IF THE NATION FELL APART  OR INTO ANY SITUATION IN WHICH IT MIGHT BE HOSTILE TO INSPECTION  COULD REQUIRE UP TO 273 000 TROOPS  THAT IS FAR MORE THAN THE PEAK OF THE AMERICAN OCCUPYING FORCE IN IRAQ LIKE IRAN  NORTH KOREA WOULD HAVE TO BEGIN ANY DENUCLEARIZATION PACT WITH A COMPREHENSIVE LISTING OF ALL ITS ATOMIC SITES  FACTORIES AND WEAPONS  WHICH AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES WOULD IMMEDIATELY COMPARE WITH THEIR OWN ESTIMATES THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ENSUING VERIFICATION WOULD DEPEND ON HOW EXTENSIVE A DISARMAMENT MR  TRUMP HAS IN MIND  AND WHETHER IT MATCHES MR  KIMS DEFINITION EVERYONE AGREES THAT SUCH A PROGRAM OF DISARMAMENT WOULD INVOLVE THE NORTHS SURRENDERING ITS NUCLEAR ARMS  BUT AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE VASTLY DIFFERING ESTIMATES OF THE SIZE OF THE ARSENAL  BE IT THE C I A S ASSESSMENT OF AROUND 20 NUCLEAR WEAPONS OR THE DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCYS ESTIMATE OF ABOUT 60  THAT MEANS IT IS POSSIBLE THAT INSPECTORS WOULD NEVER KNOW FOR SURE IF THEY HAD FOUND EVERYTHING SO FAR  THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT SAID WHETHER NORTH KOREA WOULD HAVE TO DISMANTLE MOST OR ALL OF ITS NUCLEAR FUEL PRODUCTION FACILITIES  WHICH ARE BELIEVED TO BE MUCH MORE NUMEROUS THAN IRANS  NOR IS IT CLEAR WHETHER THE NORTH WOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP ITS MISSILES NORTH KOREA IS ALSO BELIEVED TO POSSESS LARGE STORES OF GERM WEAPONS AND NERVE GAS  LIKE THE KIND USED TO ASSASSINATE MR  KIMS HALF BROTHER IN AN ATTACK LAST YEAR IN MALAYSIA BUT IT IS THE SPRAWLING NUCLEAR COMPLEX THAT POSES THE LARGEST PROBLEM  INSPECTORS AT THE I A E A  ARE NOT TRAINED TO RECOGNIZE OR HANDLE NUCLEAR WEAPONS  THEY ARE BASICALLY FORENSIC ACCOUNTANTS  KEEPING TRACK OF URANIUM AND PLUTONIUM FLOWS THROUGH FACTORIES AND OF EQUIPMENT THAT CAN BE USED TO PRODUCE NUCLEAR FUEL RIDDING THE NORTH OF ITS WARHEADS WOULD REQUIRE MILITARY SPECIALISTS FROM THE WESTERN NUCLEAR STATES  INCLUDING RENDER SAFE TEAMS TRAINED TO PREVENT ARMS FROM DETONATING  AS WELL AS POSSIBLE AGREEMENTS WITH CHINA OR RUSSIA TO TAKE THE WEAPONS EVEN SO  THE AGENCY WOULD PROBABLY BE OVERWHELMED LAST YEAR  TERO VARJORANTA  THE CHIEF INSPECTOR OF THE VIENNA BASED AGENCY  TOLD NUCLEAR EXPERTS THAT PIERCING NORTH KOREAS SECRETIVE MAZE WOULD REQUIRE NOVEL AND MODIFIED MONITORING AND VERIFICATION APPROACHES TO BE DEVELOPED  AND PROBABLY IMPLEMENTED  AT SHORT NOTICE IN A VERY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT THE AGENCY NOW MONITORS THE NUCLEAR ACTIVITIES OF 180 NATIONS WITH A CORPS OF SOME 300 INSPECTORS  INCLUDING THE 80 ASSIGNED TO ITS IRAN TASK FORCE WESTERN EXPERTS PUT THE NORTHS TOTAL NUMBER OF NUCLEAR SITES  INCLUDING ITS MAIN ATOMIC CENTER AT YONGBYON  ITS MOUNTAIN TESTING COMPLEX AND A NUMBER OF CLANDESTINE LABS AND FACILITIES  AT 40 TO 100  ACCORDING TO THE RAND REPORT IRAN  BY CONTRAST  HAS ABOUT A DOZEN SIGNIFICANT SITES AND NEVER DEVELOPED NUCLEAR WEAPONS  NOR DID IRAQ THAT IS JUST ONE METRIC TO EXPLAIN WHY THE DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH KOREA HAS NO GOOD PARALLELS IN DISARMAMENT HISTORY  SAID DAVID A  KAY  A NUCLEAR EXPERT WHO IN 2003 AND 2004 LED THE AMERICAN HUNT FOR UNCONVENTIONAL ARMS IN IRAQ THE GOAL OF NUCLEAR DISMANTLEMENT IN NORTH KOREA  DR  KAY SAID IN AN INTERVIEW  IS FAR MORE COMPLEX THAN ANYTHING THE ADMINISTRATION IS TALKING ABOUT  BECAUSE ITS ATOMIC COMPLEX IS SO LARGE  SO ADVANCED  AND IN SOME CASES  SO WELL HIDDEN THE NORTHS ATOMIC INDUSTRIAL SITE HAS SOME 400 BUILDINGS  A VAST MAZE LARGELY UNKNOWN TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD  AND ONE THAT IS MUCH LARGER THAN MOST AMERICAN WEAPON LABORATORIES AT LEAST TWO BUILDINGS HOLD REACTORS  ONE CREDITED WITH MAKING THE PLUTONIUM THAT FUELED SOME OF NORTH KOREAS ATOM BOMBS  EXPERTS SAY THE SITE IS NOW INAUGURATING A LARGE NEW REACTOR AT MOUNT MANTAP  A MILE HIGH PEAK  THE NORTH DUG A SYSTEM OF DEEP TUNNELS FOR TESTING ITS NUCLEAR BOMBS  SIX HAVE BEEN TESTED SO FAR EXPERTS SUSPECT THE MOST RECENT  IN SEPTEMBER  WAS A HYDROGEN BOMB  THERE IS SHARP DISAGREEMENT OVER WHETHER THE GARGANTUAN BLAST MADE THE SITE UNUSABLE  NEW EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THE MOUNTAIN CAN SUPPORT NEW ROUNDS OF EXPLOSIVE TESTING THE 2014 RAND STUDY  CONDUCTED FOR THE UNITED STATES ARMY  IMAGINED THE NORTHS COLLAPSE AND A MILITARY RUSH TO SECURE AND REMOVE ITS WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION  THE TROOP ESTIMATES WERE DRIVEN BY THE NEED TO SECURE THE NUCLEAR SITES  THOUGH THE STUDY ALSO LOOKED AT NORTH KOREAS CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ARMS  AS WELL AS LONG RANGE MISSILES IN ADDITION  THE STUDY TOOK INTO ACCOUNT A WIDE RANGE OF EXPECTED OPPOSITION AND HOSTILITY FROM NORTH KOREAS MILITARY  IT PUT THE AMERICAN FORCE REQUIREMENTS AT 73 000 TROOPS IN A SITUATION WHERE IT WAS UNCLEAR HOW THEY WOULD BE RECEIVED  OR UP TO 273 000 IF THERE WAS ACTIVE RESISTANCE  CURRENTLY  THE UNITED STATES KEEPS ABOUT 28 000 TROOPS IN SOUTH KOREA DR  KAY  THE HEAD OF THE AMERICAN HUNT IN IRAQ FOR UNCONVENTIONAL WEAPONS  ESTIMATED THAT UP TO 300 INSPECTORS WOULD BE NEEDED IN THE NORTH  BUT HE SAID THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO FIND ENOUGH SPECIALISTS WITH THE REQUISITE SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE FRANKLY  HE SAID  THERES A LIMIT TO THE TALENT POOL TO SUCCEED WITH A RELATIVELY SMALL FORCE OF INSPECTORS  DR  KAY SAID THE NORTHS DENUCLEARIZATION PROGRAM WOULD REQUIRE THE NATIONS FULL COOPERATION  TO FREE INSPECTORS FROM WHAT HE CALLED THE ARDUOUS TASK OF HUNTING DOWN CLANDESTINE SITES AND OUTWITTING OTHER ASPECTS OF DECEPTION AND DENIAL IN THE END  DR  KAY SAID  A SUCCESSFUL CASE OF ATOMIC VERIFICATION WOULD PROBABLY RELY EXTENSIVELY ON THE NORTH KOREANS THEMSELVES  AS ONLY THEY UNDERSTOOD THE REAL DIMENSIONS OF THEIR SPRAWLING NUCLEAR COMPLEX THE INSPECTIONS  HE ADDED  WOULD PROBABLY COME DOWN TO MONITORING HOW NORTH KOREAN EXPERTS GO ABOUT THE DENUCLEARIZATION ITS NOT GOING TO BE LIKE IRAQ  WHERE WED FIND SOMETHING AND DESTROY IT  DR  KAY SAID  ITS GOING TO BE COMING IN AS OBSERVERS OF WHAT THE NORTH IS GOING TO DO  AND THAT WILL LET YOU KEEP THE NUMBERS SMALL  IT WILL BE LOOKING OVER THEIR SHOULDERS DR  KAY SAID THAT SUCH AN OUTCOME WAS PROBABLY ALL RIGHT IF ALL YOU WANT IS A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE  AS MR  TRUMP HAS WELCOMED BUT  HE ADDED  IT WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH TO REACH THE DEMANDING STANDARD OF OBTAINING HARD PROOF THAT A COUNTRY HAS GOTTEN RID OF ALL ITS NUCLEAR ARMS AND THE COMPLICATED MEANS OF PRODUCING THEM IM NOT SURE THATS WHAT THEY MEAN BY DENUCLEARIZATION  HE SAID

20180503,politics,politics,3,AS SCOTT PRUITT  THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY  WAS PREPARING TO DEFEND HIMSELF BEFORE CONGRESS LAST WEEK AGAINST CHARGES OF EXTRAVAGANT SPENDING AND OTHER IMPROPRIETIES  HE FOUND TIME TO TRAVEL TO COCHRAN  GA  TO ADDRESS THE GEORGIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION ON THE DAY AFTER EARTH DAY  HE ANNOUNCED YET ANOTHER POLICY THAT WILL DAMAGE THE ENVIRONMENT HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTING  HE TOLD THE GROUP THAT THE E P A  WOULD NOW DECLARE THE BURNING OF WOOD FROM MANAGED FORESTS FOR ENERGY PRODUCTION BY POWER PLANTS AND OTHER STATIONARY SOURCES TO BE CARBON NEUTRAL BY THAT  HE MEANT THAT  IN THE AGENCYS VIEW  THERE WOULD BE NO NET RELEASE OF CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE  BECAUSE REPLANTING THE FOREST THAT HAD JUST BEEN CUT AND BURNED COULD OFFSET THOSE EMISSIONS  THIS DETERMINATION COULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR WOOD BURNING POWER PLANTS TO WIN REGULATORY APPROVAL BUT MR  PRUITTS DECLARATION CONTRADICTS SOME BASIC FACTS  BURNING WOOD FROM FORESTS TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY IS NOT CARBON NEUTRAL WHEN THE DIRECT EMISSIONS FROM COMBUSTION  PLUS EMISSIONS FROM SOIL AND LOGGING AND PROCESSING THE WOOD  ARE CONSIDERED  SCIENTIFIC STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IT WILL WORSEN THE CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE FOR DECADES OR THROUGH THE END OF THIS CENTURY  THIS WAS NOT A DECISION BASED IN SCIENCE  BUT IN POLITICS  A GIVEAWAY TO THE FOREST PRODUCTS INDUSTRY  AS MR  PRUITT HAS PUT IT  IT WILL PROVIDE THE INDUSTRY WITH CERTAINTY IN THE AGENCYS PERMITTING PROCESS THE FORESTRY ASSOCIATION UNDERSTANDABLY APPLAUDED THE DECISION  ADMINISTRATOR PRUITTS ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY REFLECTS THE CLEAR SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS ON FOREST BIOMASS  SAID ANDRES VILLEGAS  THE PRESIDENT OF THE GROUP THIS STATEMENT ALSO COULD NOT BE FARTHER FROM THE TRUTH  WE ARE AMONG 13 RESEARCH SCIENTISTS WHO HAVE JOINED TO CHALLENGE THESE BLATANTLY INACCURATE ASSERTIONS  WE ARE NOT OUTLIERS ON THIS  IN JANUARY  796 SCIENTISTS FROM THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE SENT A LETTER TO THE EUROPEAN UNION PARLIAMENT WARNING AGAINST A PLAN THAT WOULD PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR CUTTING TREES TO BURN FOR ENERGY EVEN IF FORESTS ARE ALLOWED TO REGROW  THOSE SCIENTISTS WROTE  USING WOOD DELIBERATELY HARVESTED FOR BURNING WILL INCREASE CARBON IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND WARMING FOR DECADES TO CENTURIES  AND THAT IS THE CASE  THE SCIENTISTS ADDED  EVEN WHEN WOOD REPLACES COAL  OIL OR NATURAL GAS ITS BASIC SCIENCE  THE SIMPLE FACT IS THAT CUTTING AND BURNING TREES ADDS CARBON DIOXIDE TO THE ATMOSPHERE  TRAPPING RADIANT HEAT FROM THE EARTH AND MAKING THE PLANET WARMER THE ADDED CARBON DIOXIDE IS REMOVED FROM THE ATMOSPHERE ONLY IF THE FOREST THAT IS CUT DOWN IS REPLACED BY A NEW GENERATION OF TREES   TREES AND OTHER GREEN PLANTS REMOVE CARBON DIOXIDE FROM THE AIR AND USE IT TO MAKE LEAVES  WOOD AND ROOTS THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS  BUT REGROWTH TAKES TIME  A CENTURY OR MORE FOR NATIVE FORESTS  ASSUMING THEY DONT FALL VICTIM TO WILDFIRE OR DISEASE  AND REGROWTH NEVER OCCURS IF THE LAND IS DEVELOPED OR CONVERTED TO PASTURE OR FARMLAND MOREOVER  THROUGHOUT THE MANY DECADES BEFORE THE REPLACEMENT FORESTS CAN GROW ENOUGH TO REMOVE THE EXTRA CARBON DIOXIDE FROM THE ATMOSPHERE  THE PREVIOUSLY ADDED GAS WILL THAW MORE PERMAFROST AND MELT MORE ICE  MAKE OCEAN ACIDIFICATION WORSE  ACCELERATE GLOBAL WARMING  SPEED SEA LEVEL RISE  INCREASE THE INCIDENCE OF EXTREME WEATHER  WORSEN DROUGHT AND WATER STRESS  AND HURT CROP YIELDS  EFFECTS THAT WILL PERSIST FOR CENTURIES OR LONGER WE MUST REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS NOW  NOT INCREASE THEM ATMOSPHERIC LEVELS OF CARBON DIOXIDE WOULD BE RISING MUCH FASTER THAN THEY ARE NOW IF THERE WERE NO FORESTS  IN THE UNITED STATES  FORESTS REMOVED ABOUT 11 6 PERCENT OF THE CARBON DIOXIDE PUMPED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE IN THIS COUNTRY IN 2016 FORESTS ARE ALSO VITAL FOR OTHER REASONS  OF COURSE  PROTECTING AGAINST FLOODS AND SUPPORTING DIVERSE PLANT AND ANIMAL COMMUNITIES  ONE NEEDS ONLY TO VISIT THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES TO SEE CLEAR CUTTING BY THE BIOMASS INDUSTRY AND THE DESTRUCTION OF SOME OF THE MOST BIODIVERSE LANDS ON THE CONTINENT  THE RESULTING SOIL EROSION RUINS THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THESE LANDS AND LEADS DIRECTLY TO THE SILTING OF RIVERS AND INCREASED FLOODING  FURTHERMORE  AIR POLLUTION FROM THE WOOD BIOENERGY INDUSTRY DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES BURNING WOOD FOR FUEL DISCHARGES MORE CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS THAN BURNING COAL AND IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN UTILITY SCALE WIND OR SOLAR ENERGY  AS OF EARLY LAST YEAR  BRITAIN HAD SPENT ABOUT  3 BILLION OVER THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS TO SUBSIDIZE WOOD PELLETS IMPORTED FROM NORTH AMERICA AND BURNED FOR ENERGY  BRITISH TAXPAYERS THERE ARE PAYING ELECTRICITY PROVIDERS TO MAKE CLIMATE CHANGE WORSE WILL THE UNITED STATES NOW FOLLOW THIS ERRONEOUS PATH AS WELL  IN 2016  ABOUT 2 PERCENT OF TOTAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN THE UNITED STATES WAS FROM WOOD AND WOOD WASTE  ACCORDING TO THE ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION  THATS MORE THAN ENOUGH  THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SHOULD FOCUS ON EXPANDING ZERO EMITTING SOURCES LIKE SOLAR AND WIND POWER  NEITHER PRODUCES HEALTH DAMAGING AIR POLLUTION OR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WHILE GENERATING ELECTRICITY MR  PRUITTS DECISION TO CONSIDER FOREST BIOENERGY AS CARBON NEUTRAL IS NEITHER SCIENTIFICALLY JUSTIFIED NOR ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENT  HIS JUSTIFICATION IS A CONCOCTED FACT TO SUPPORT THE FOREST PRODUCTS INDUSTRY AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PLANET

MAJOR TAX OVERHAUL  MR  RENACCI WILL BE RIGHT THERE WITH HIM AS HE TRIES TO UNSEAT SENATOR SHERROD BROWN  MR  RENACCI IS CLOAKING HIMSELF IN THE TRUMP AURA  HOPING THAT HE CAN REPLICATE THE SUCCESS THAT MR  TRUMP FOUND IN THIS STATE IN THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION  BUT IT IS A CLOAK THAT MAY REST UNCOMFORTABLY ON THE SHOULDERS OF AN AFFLUENT  SOFT SPOKEN BUSINESSMAN CUT FAR MORE FROM THE MOLD OF THE OLD REPUBLICAN PARTY THAN MR  TRUMPS NEW ONE AND IF MR  RENACCI CAN CLEAR THE HURDLE OF TUESDAYS REPUBLICAN SENATE PRIMARY HERE  HE WILL FACE ANOTHER  FAR HIGHER ONE IN MR  BROWN  A GRAVELLY VOICED POPULIST WHOSE LONGSTANDING SUPPORT FOR PROTECTIONIST TRADE POLICIES  INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING AND ENTITLEMENTS LIKE MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY IS MORE IN LINE WITH MR  TRUMP THAN THE JIM RENACCI WHO WAS ELECTED TO CONGRESS IN 2010 AS AN OLD LINE  SMALL GOVERNMENT CONSERVATIVE BUT AS MR  RENACCI SEES IT  AFTER HELPING TO SEND MR  TRUMP TO THE WHITE HOUSE  OHIO VOTERS NOW HAVE A CHANCE TO REMOVE ONE OF THE IMPEDIMENTS STANDING IN THE PRESIDENTS WAY BY DENYING MR  BROWN  A DEMOCRAT  FROM SERVING A THIRD TERM THE REASON WHY THE PRESIDENT ENDORSED ME AND ASKED ME TO RUN IS HE WANTS SOMEBODY WHO CAN HELP HIM GET HIS AGENDA DONE  NOT SOMEBODY WHOS GOING TO VOTE AGAINST HIM  MR  RENACCI SAID AS HE SAT IN A BOOTH AT A CHICKEN WING RESTAURANT HERE MR  RENACCI  WITH AN ESTIMATED NET WORTH OF AT LEAST  MILLION  ACCORDING TO ROLL CALL  HAS HAD A LONG AND VARIED BUSINESS CAREER  WITH INVOLVEMENT IN NURSING HOMES  HARLEY DAVIDSON DEALERSHIPS  A CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP AND PARTIAL

AS HE HELD ON TO THE TRADITIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE REPUBLICAN VOTE BUSINESSMEN AND BUSINESSWOMEN HAVE DIFFERENT STYLES  HE CONCEDED  IM MORE THE QUIET STYLE ALL OF THAT MAKES HIS EMBRACE OF MR  TRUMP AN IMPERFECT FIT  FOR ONE THING  MR  TRUMP PLEDGED TO DRAIN THE SWAMP  AND MR  RENACCI  WHO WAS FIRST ELECTED TO THE HOUSE NEARLY EIGHT YEARS AGO  IS TESTING JUST HOW LONG SOMEONE CAN BE IN WASHINGTON BEFORE BECOMING PART OF WHAT MUST BE DRAINED IN FACT  NOT TOO LONG AGO  MR  RENACCI WANTED OUT OF CONGRESS ENTIRELY  HE HAD BEEN RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR  BUT HE SWITCHED TO THE SENATE RACE AFTER JOSH MANDEL  THE REPUBLICAN STATE TREASURER  DROPPED OUT OF THE CONTEST THIS IS A GUY THAT DOESNT WORK THE ROOM  SAID DAVID B  COHEN  A POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF AKRON  ITS UNCLEAR WHETHER HE REALLY ENJOYS WHAT HE DOES FOR A LIVING RIGHT NOW IN TUESDAYS PRIMARY  MR  RENACCI FACES COMPETITION FOR TRUMP VOTERS WHO MIGHT AGAIN BE DRAWN TO SOMEONE WHO PRESENTS HIMSELF AS AN INSURGENT  HIS MAIN OPPONENT IS MIKE GIBBONS  A WEALTHY INVESTMENT BANKER WHO SPEAKS ADMIRINGLY OF MR  TRUMPS AGENDA AND RAISED MONEY FOR HIM WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IM AN OUTSIDER  AND IM BLUNT  AND I TELL THE TRUTH  MR  GIBBONS SAID AT A RALLY OUTSIDE CINCINNATI ON THURSDAY  WHERE HE APPEARED WITH SENATOR RAND PAUL  REPUBLICAN OF KENTUCKY   THE ESTABLISHMENT IS ALL BEHIND THE OTHER GUY  MR  PAUL SAID OF MR  RENACCI  NOT MEANING IT AS A COMPLIMENT IN AN INTERVIEW  MR  GIBBONS SAID MR  RENACCI SIMPLY DID NOT CONNECT WITH PEOPLE AND COULD NOT BEAT MR  BROWN  AT THE RALLY  HE WAS UNSPARING  ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I HAVE GOING FOR ME IS WHEN JIM RENACCI SPEAKS TO A GROUP  I GET MORE VOTES  HE SAID TO LAUGHS  ID LIKE TO INCREASE HIS SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS ANOTHER COMPLICATION IS THE ISSUE OF TRADE MR  BROWN VOTED AGAINST THE NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT AS A HOUSE MEMBER AND EVEN WROTE A BOOK CALLED MYTHS OF FREE TRADE  WHEN MR  TRUMP IMPOSED TARIFFS ON IMPORTED STEEL AND ALUMINUM THIS YEAR  MR  BROWN CHEERED HIM ON MR  RENACCI  BY CONTRAST  HAS VOTED FOR TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH SOUTH KOREA  COLOMBIA AND PANAMA  AND HE ALSO SUPPORTED GIVING PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA ENHANCED TRADE NEGOTIATING POWER THE TRADE ISSUE HAS BEEN DIFFICULT FOR RENACCI BECAUSE HE IS REALLY YOUR TYPICAL BIG BUSINESS REPUBLICAN  PROFESSOR COHEN SAID  TRUMPS MORE POPULIST TONE ON ISSUES LIKE TRADE DOVETAILS REALLY WELL WITH SHERROD BROWNS POSITION ON TRADE AND OTHER POPULIST ISSUES THAT BROWN HAS BEEN ADVOCATING FOR DECADES ASKED ABOUT TRADE  MR  RENACCI STRUGGLED  HE SUGGESTED THAT MR  BROWN WAS FOCUSED ON PROTECTING STEELWORKERS AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER INDUSTRIES  LIKE FARMING AND MANUFACTURING  PRECISELY THE CRITICISM LEVELED AT MR  TRUMP  HE THEN SUGGESTED THAT THE PRESIDENT IS COMING AROUND TO HIS VIEWS WHAT HES DOING IS HES LISTENING  LEARNING AND THEN HES GOING TO LEAD  SO IN THE END I THINK THE TARIFF POLICIES AND PROGRAMS WILL CHANGE  MR  RENACCI SAID OF MR  TRUMP  IN THE END  HELL GET CLOSER TO WHAT OHIO NEEDS MR  RENACCIS EMBRACE OF MR  TRUMP CARRIES AN OBVIOUS DANGER  TURNING OFF VOTERS WHO SEE A RISK THAT HE WOULD SIMPLY BE A RUBBER STAMP OUR PRESIDENTS

20180501,politics,election,1,WASHINGTON  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS ANGRILY PROTESTING A LEAKED LIST OF QUESTIONS THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT S SPECIAL COUNSEL MAY WANT TO ASK HIM  WHILE AT THE SAME TIME CONTENDING THE LIST SHOWS ANEW THERE WAS NO CRIME OR COLLUSION WITH THE RUSSIANS BY HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  BUT THE QUESTIONS SUGGEST THAT INVESTIGATORS WANT TO FOCUS ON COLLUSION AND OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE THE QUESTIONS  SOME 49 IN ALL  WERE PUBLISHED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES  WHICH SAID THEY WERE COMPILED BY TRUMP S LAWYERS DURING NEGOTIATIONS WITH SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER S INVESTIGATORS OVER A POSSIBLE INTERVIEW WITH THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF  THE TIMES SAID IT GOT THE LIST FROM SOMEONE  OUTSIDE MR  TRUMP S LEGAL TEAM A PERSON FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER  WHO INSISTED ON ANONYMITY TO DISCUSS ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS  TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS THAT THE TRUMP LAWYERS EXTRAPOLATED A LIST OF EXPECTED QUESTIONS BASED OFF CONVERSATIONS WITH MUELLER S TEAM  THE QUESTIONS CONTAINED IN A DOCUMENT POSTED ONLINE BY THE TIMES ON MONDAY NIGHT REFLECTED QUESTIONS THAT DEFENSE LAWYERS ANTICIPATED RATHER THAN VERBATIM QUERIES THAT MUELLER S TEAM PROVIDED  THE PERSON SAID THE LEAK WAS  SO DISGRACEFUL  TRUMP TWEETED ON TUESDAY   NO QUESTIONS ON COLLUSION  HE SAID   COLLUSION THAT NEVER EXISTED  THAT S THE IDEA THAT HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN COLLABORATED WITH RUSSIANS WHO WERE TRYING TO HELP HIM TO THE OVAL OFFICE  AS FOR OBSTRUCTION OF THE INVESTIGATION AFTER HE TOOK OFFICE  HE SCOFFED   IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO OBSTRUCT JUSTICE FOR A CRIME THAT NEVER HAPPENED THERE S STILL NO WORD FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AS TO WHETHER TRUMP WILL SIT DOWN TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS OR OTHERS FOR THE INVESTIGATION SOME TAKEAWAYS FROM THE LIST OBSTRUCTION IS A KEY FOCUSIT HAS LONG BEEN CLEAR THAT MUELLER IS INTERESTED IN WHETHER TRUMP MAY HAVE OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE  THE QUESTIONS PUBLISHED BY THE TIMES SHOW JUST HOW MUCH OF A FOCUS IT COULD BE ALTHOUGH MUELLER S TEAM HAS INDICATED TO TRUMP S LAWYERS THAT HE S NOT CONSIDERED A  TARGET  OF THE PROBE  INVESTIGATORS WANT TO INTERVIEW HIM ABOUT SEVERAL EPISODES EARLY IN HIS TERM THE BULK OF THE QUESTIONS FOCUS ON THE FIRING OF FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY  TRUMP S RELATIONSHIP WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS  WHOM HE HAS ANGRILY CRITICIZED FOR RECUSING HIMSELF FROM THE RUSSIA PROBE  AND HIS FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER  MICHAEL FLYNN  ACCORDING TO COMEY  TRUMP ENCOURAGED COMEY TO DROP AN INVESTIGATION INTO FLYNN THE QUESTIONS ATTEMPT TO DRILL DOWN INTO TRUMP S CONFLICTING PUBLIC ANSWERS FOR HIS REASONS FOR FIRING COMEY  IN ONE INTERVIEW HE REFERENCED  THIS RUSSIA THING   AND ASK HIM ABOUT THE DECISION MORE DIRECTLY REGARDING THE DECISION TO FIRE MR  COMEY  WHEN WAS IT MADE  WHY  WHO PLAYED A ROLE  READS ONE QUESTION COLLUSION IS STILL A FOCUS  TOODESPITE TRUMP S DISMISSAL OF THE IDEA  THE LIST DOES APPEAR TO INDICATE THAT MUELLER IS LOOKING INTO POSSIBLE COLLUSION OR COORDINATION WITH RUSSIA  SOME TOUCH ON RUSSIAN MEDDLING IN THE U S  ELECTION AND WHETHER THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN COORDINATED IN ANY WAY WITH THE KREMLIN  ONE QUESTION ASKS WHAT TRUMP KNEW ABOUT MEMBERS OF HIS CAMPAIGN STAFF  INCLUDING FORMER CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN PAUL MANAFORT  REACHING OUT TO MOSCOW MUELLER HAS BROUGHT SEVERAL CHARGES AGAINST MANAFORT ALREADY  INCLUDING MONEY LAUNDERING AND BANK FRAUD  NONE OF THE CHARGES RELATES TO ALLEGATIONS OF RUSSIAN ELECTION INTERFERENCE AND POSSIBLE COORDINATION WITH TRUMP ASSOCIATES  AND MANAFORT HAS DENIED HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH ANY SUCH EFFORT ANOTHER QUESTION ASKS WHAT DISCUSSIONS TRUMP MAY HAVE HAD REGARDING  ANY MEETING  WITH RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN  STILL ANOTHER ASKS WHAT THE PRESIDENT MAY HAVE KNOWN ABOUT A POSSIBLE ATTEMPT BY HIS SON IN LAW  JARED KUSHNER  TO SET UP A BACK CHANNEL WITH RUSSIA BEFORE THE U S  INAUGURATION MUELLER IS WATCHING TRUMP S TWEETSAT LEAST TWO QUESTIONS DIRECTLY ADDRESS TWEETS FROM THE PRESIDENT ONE ASKS   WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF YOUR MAY 12  2017  TWEET  THAT REFERENCES A TWEET TRUMP POSTED AFTER REPORTS THAT COMEY DESCRIBED A PRIVATE DINNER WITH THE PRESIDENT IN PERSONAL MEMOS  COMEY WROTE IN A MEMO THAT TRUMP REPEATEDLY ASKED HIM FOR LOYALTY JAMES COMEY BETTER HOPE THAT THERE ARE NO  TAPES  OF OUR CONVERSATIONS BEFORE HE STARTS LEAKING TO THE PRESS  TRUMP TWEETED ANOTHER QUESTION ASKS ABOUT TWEETS IN WHICH TRUMP SUGGESTED COMEY SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED FOR THE WAY HE HANDLED AN INVESTIGATION INTO HILLARY CLINTON S EMAILS THE QUESTIONS ALSO REFERENCE TELEVISION INTERVIEWS THAT TRUMP HAS GIVEN WILL TRUMP ACTUALLY FACE THESE QUESTIONS IT S STILL UNCLEAR WHETHER MUELLER S INVESTIGATORS WILL BE ABLE TO ASK TRUMP ANY QUESTIONS  OR WHETHER THESE ARE THE ONES THEY WOULD ASK  TRUMP HAS SAID HE WANTS TO TALK TO MUELLER  BUT MORE RECENTLY  HE AND HIS TEAM OF LAWYERS  WHICH HAS UNDERGONE CHANGES IN RECENT MONTHS  HAVE NOT SAID WHEN  OR IF IT S ALSO NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE LEAK OF THE QUESTIONS WAS MEANT TO SOMEHOW INFLUENCE WHETHER TRUMP WILL DO THE INTERVIEW COMEY  IN AN INTERVIEW  GAVE AN OPINION THAT STEERED CLEAR OF POLITICS AND SOUNDED LIKE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL HE USED TO BE   JUST AS WE VE DONE IN MANY INVESTIGATIONS  YOU WANT TO DEVELOP A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTS AND THEN CHECK THEM WITH THE SUBJECT AND SEE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT IT IN THE MEANTIME  MUELLER S INVESTIGATION CONTINUES  ON TUESDAY  THE SPECIAL COUNSEL S OFFICE AND FLYNN  A KEY COOPERATOR  AGREED TO PUT OFF SETTING HIS SENTENCING DATE FOR ANOTHER 60 DAYS  SAYING THE DELAY WAS NECESSARY  DUE TO THE STATUS  OF THE INVESTIGATION ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER CHAD DAY CONTRIBUTED TO THIS REPORT
20180502,entertainment,movies,5,THIS IS THE FIRST OF FIVE ARTICLES  WRITTEN FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ONE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE  JESSE WANTS TO MEET ME FOR COFFEE  AND I BET I KNOW WHY  WHAT I DONT KNOW IS WHY IM NOT PREPARED OF COURSE HE INTENDS TO PROPOSE TO MY DAUGHTER  SARAH  THE NEWS IS MERELY THAT ITS IMMINENT  OF COURSE SHELL SAY YES  EVEN I  WITH MY PERFERVID IMAGINATION  CANNOT CONCOCT A SCENARIO IN WHICH SHE TURNS HIM DOWN  IVE HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO THINK OF THE RIGHT THING TO SAY  AND YET ALL I CAN MANAGE IS A HUG AND A MAZEL TOV  SINCE YIDDISH SEEMS TO BE THE DEFAULT LANGUAGE FOR MONUMENTAL GOOD NEWS WHEN IM OTHERWISE SPEECHLESS THIS IS THE INAUGURAL MOMENT OF MY TENURE AS THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE  AND IVE BLOWN IT  A HUG AND CONGRATULATIONS IS NOT THE MEMORABLE RESPONSE THAT JESSE WILL RECALL AND RECOUNT FOR DECADES  YOUD THINK A WRITER COULD MUSTER SOMETHING MORE  I BETTER START WORKING ON MY TOAST WAIT  MY PINBALL BRAIN LIGHTS UP WITH A BIGGER IDEA  I OFFER JESSE A DIAMOND FOR THE ENGAGEMENT RING  AND WE MAKE A DATE FOR HIM TO COME BY AND LOOK AT THE JEWELS THERE ARENT MANY TO SPEAK OF  I LEAD AN UNADORNED LIFE  PROBABLY IN REACTION TO MY MOTHERS DEFINING PROPOSITION  WHICH BOILED DOWN TO I WEAR JEWELRY  THEREFORE  I AM  I HAVE NEVER BOUGHT MYSELF ANYTHING MORE THAN THE OCCASIONAL CHEAP EARRINGS  BECAUSE GIVEN THE CHOICE BETWEEN A SERIOUS PAIR AND A PLANE TICKET  I ALWAYS TOOK THE TRIP  I RELY ON HAND ME DOWNS  LITTLE DIAMOND STUDS THAT BELONGED TO MY MOTHER  MINUS THE WEIRD GOLD TEARDROPS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO HANG FROM THEM  MY FATHERS OLD WATCH  WHICH WORKS EVERY NOW AND THEN  HIS FAVORITE RING  A LOCKET MY MOTHER GOT WHEN SHE WAS BORN THATS PRETTIER THAN THE ONE I GOT WHEN I WAS THE ONLY LIKELY CANDIDATE FOR THE RING IS A STONE FROM MY GRANDMOTHERS WEDDING RING  MY MOTHER GAVE IT TO ME ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO  OR RATHER  GAVE ME THE STONES RESET IN A NEW RING MADE FOR MY GRANDPARENTS 50TH ANNIVERSARY  BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT I WAS TOO OLD NOT TO HAVE A DIAMOND MORE SUBSTANTIAL THAN THE EARRINGS SHED ALREADY GIVEN ME ITS THE UGLIEST RING IVE EVER SEEN  SHE SAID  BUT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE STONES  SHE WASNT EXAGGERATING  THE 1921 ORIGINAL MIGHT HAVE BEEN NICE  THE 1971 REDO LOOKED LIKE A FREEWAY ON RAMP  WITH VERY SMALL DIAMONDS CIRCLING UP TO THE BIGGER STONE  THE ETCHED GOLD SETTING A FAIR APPROXIMATION OF WORN CONCRETE SARAH WAS TAKING A JEWELRY MAKING CLASS IN HIGH SCHOOL AT THE TIME  SO SHE DESIGNED A THIN WHITE GOLD CHAIN WITH THE SMALL DIAMONDS SET INTO IT AND THE BIGGER STONE AT THE CENTER  A JEWELER TURNED THE DRAWING INTO A NECKLACE IVE WORN EVER SINCE  THE STONE NESTLED JUST BELOW MY COLLARBONE WHEN I GOT HOME FROM COFFEE WITH JESSE  I TOOK OFF THE NECKLACE AND HELD THE CHAIN TIGHT AROUND MY RING FINGER  TO SEE WHAT THE DIAMOND MIGHT LOOK LIKE ON SARAHS HAND  IT WAS PRETTY PERFECT 3 GENERATIONS OF DNAAS IT TURNS OUT  SARAH HAS HAD THE SAME IDEA  WHICH SHE MENTIONS BARELY A WEEK LATER  WHEN JESSE IS OUT OF TOWN  SHE WONDERS  ON A PURELY THEORETICAL AND HYPOTHETICAL BASIS  YOU UNDERSTAND  IF I MIGHT CONSIDER LETTING HER HAVE THE DIAMOND FOR AN ENGAGEMENT RING  TINY SARAH AND ANCIENT ETHEL MET TWICE AND SHARED A RAPTUROUS INTEREST IN THE LITTLE SINGING BIRDS IN A BIG CAGE AT THE NURSING HOME WHERE ETHEL LIVED AS SHE HEADED FOR 102  SARAH GREW UP LIGHT ON RELATIVES  SHE LIKED HAVING A GREAT GRANDMOTHER  AND ETHEL LIKED BEING ONE  HAVING STARTED TO WONDER  ALOUD  WHY GOD KEPT HER HANGING AROUND  WHEN I TOLD HER I WAS PREGNANT  SHE WROTE BACK TO SAY HOW PLEASED SHE WAS TO HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION I FEINT  IM HAPPY THAT SARAH WANTS THE STONE SHES GOING TO GET  BUT I CANT TELL HER THAT WELL  I SAY  LET ME MAKE SURE FIRST THAT IT ISNT A RHINESTONE OR SOMETHING  WHICH GETS A CHUCKLE AND BUYS ME SOME TIME HERES A DILEMMA  WHOM SHOULD I BETRAY  I CAN RUIN JESSES PLAN AND TELL SARAH THAT THE DIAMONDS ON ITS WAY  OR I CAN KEEP A SECRET FROM MY FLESH AND BLOOD  WHICH FEELS LIKE LYING  AND HOPE THAT SHELL FORGIVE ME THE RHINESTONE JOKE BUYS ME TIME  AND HAVING CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE STONES A FAKE  I FIGURE I OUGHT TO CONSULT AN EXPERT  I FIND A JEWELER WHOSE TESTIMONIALS OUTSTRIP THE COMPETITION AND SHOW HIM WHAT I HOPE IS A VERY OLD DIAMOND HE SMILES  ITS A 97 YEAR OLD STONE HOW CAN YOU TELL ITS IMPERFECT  HE SAYS  IT WAS CUT BY A PERSON  NOT A LASER THERES A SMALL NOTE OF APOLOGY IN HIS VOICE  AND YET IM SUDDENLY LIGHTHEARTED  CUT BY A PERSON AND  SO  IMPERFECT  THIS SEEMS JUST RIGHT FOR THE DICE ROLL OF HAPPILY EVER AFTER  AT THE MOMENT I RESIDE IN THE GAP BETWEEN DIVORCE AND DATING  WHERE I PONDER WHETHER TO CLAMBER UP THE OPPOSITE SLOPE OR JUST PLANT TOMATOES AND SETTLE IN RIGHT HERE  WATCHING WHATEVER ROMANCE TURNER CLASSIC MOVIES SENDS MY WAY  I AM A WISER REALIST AND A DIE HARD ROMANTIC  SO IMPERFECTION APPEALS TO ME  I JUST HOPE JESSE WONT BE DISAPPOINTED HE ISNT  HE DROPS BY VERY SOON AFTER TO CLAIM THE NECKLACE ON HIS WAY TO THE JEWELER I WANTED TO WEAR IT RIGHT UP TO THE LAST MINUTE  SO I UNDO THE CLASP  DROP THE NECKLACE INTO A LITTLE FABRIC POUCH  AND GIVE IT TO HIM IM HANDING IT OFF WITH THREE GENERATIONS OF DNA ON IT  I SAY  AND THEN WE STAND THERE  HE WANTS TO DASH OFF AND YET HE DOESNT  I WANT HIM TO SAIL AWAY AND YET I DONT  SO I PUT ON MY COAT AND WALK THE BLOCK TO THE SUBWAY WITH HIM  TO DRAG THIS OUT  WE LINGER FOR A MOMENT BEFORE HE SAYS THANK YOU  TURNS AND HURRIES DOWN THE STAIRS  I CANNOT SAY FOR SURE THAT HIS FEET TOUCH THE GROUND THE ILLUSION AND THE MAGICSARAH KNOWS THAT I DO NOT PROCRASTINATE  SO I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING TO HER ABOUT THE DIAMOND  FOR DAYS I HIDE BEHIND TEXTS ABOUT HOW INSANELY BUSY I AM  BUT WE HAVE A DATE TO LISTEN TO AN OLD FRIEND WHOS SINGING AT A TIMES SQUARE CLUB  AND I CANT PULL OFF PHONY EXCUSES IN PERSON  I DECIDE TO TELL HER THAT SHE CAN HAVE THE DIAMOND  BUT NOT THAT JESSE ALREADY HAS IT  WHEN WE GO OUT TO EAT AFTER THE SHOW  BY THE TIME SHE FIGURES OUT HOW TO TELL HIM  THE RING WILL BE READY THE SHOW RUNS LATE  NO TIME FOR SUPPER ON A WORK NIGHT  BUT I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND  AS WE HEAD FOR THE SUBWAY  I SCAN THE NEIGHBORHOOD FOR A PROPER SETTING  SIXTH AVENUE AND 50TH STREET IS A MIDNIGHT CONSTRUCTION ZONE  BUT THERE IS A LITTLE STAND OF TREES AT 49TH STREET  STILL WEARING THEIR TINY IVORY HOLIDAY LIGHTS  I MARCH HER OVER  PUT MY HANDS ON HER SHOULDERS  AND TELL HER SHE CAN HAVE THE DIAMOND  WHICH CONVENIENTLY ECLIPSES THE QUESTION OF WHY IM NOT WEARING IT I CAN SUMMON UP THE SENSE MEMORY OF A HANDFUL OF FIERCE  LINGERING HUGS OVER TIME  HAVING TO DO WITH VARIOUS ANIMALS WHO BECAME PART OF OUR FAMILY  OR WILDLY DECORATED BIRTHDAY CAKES  OR FIRST JOBS OR BOOKS PUBLISHED OR WHATEVER WE AGREE MATTERS  THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF 49TH AND SIXTH BECOMES PART OF THAT FAMILY LIBRARY  THE MOMENT WHEN A GHOST GREAT GRANDMOTHER  A FRAIL GRANDMOTHER  AND SARAH AND I SHARE A SINGLE EMBRACE  ALL THAT HISTORY  ALL THAT FLAWED AND WELL INTENTIONED LOVE AND THATS WHERE THIS PART OF THE STORY ENDS  NOT WITH THE PROPOSAL  NOT WITH THE WEDDING PLANS  THE DRESS  THE FOOD  THE INVITATIONS  NONE OF IT THIS ENDS  EVEN AS IT BEGINS  WITH A MAN DASHING DOWN THE SUBWAY STAIRS  A DIAMOND NECKLACE IN HIS JACKET POCKET  A WOMAN ANTICIPATING A RING THAT HOLDS THEN AND NOW TOGETHER  AND A PENDING MOTHER OF THE BRIDE WHO KNOWS FLAT OUT WHAT AN ILLUSION ROMANCE CAN BE  AND YET INDULGES  DESPITE EVERYTHING  IN A GLORIOUS DOSE OF WHY NOT

A LEFT HANDER TROTS OUT OF THE TAMPA BAY BULLPEN AND OVERCOMES INCALCULABLE ODDS THAT IS HOW IT WAS IN THE ROOKIE  THE FILM ABOUT JIM MORRIS  A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER AND COACH WHO REACHED THE MAJORS IN 1999  AND THAT IS HOW IT WAS ON APRIL 25 FOR JONNY VENTERS  WHO RETURNED TO THE MAJORS AFTER A 2 027 DAY ABSENCE  WITH AN ELBOW THAT HAD UNDERGONE THREE TOMMY JOHN SURGERIES IT FELT LIKE I WAS MAKING MY DEBUT AGAIN  VENTERS SAID  I HAD ALL THE SAME NERVES AND EXCITEMENT AND ANXIETY VENTERS RETIRED THE ORIOLES CHRIS DAVIS ON A GROUNDER IN BALTIMORE THAT NIGHT  AND HAS SINCE TOSSED SCORELESS INNINGS IN BOSTON AND DETROIT  HE ONCE PITCHED LIKE THIS WITH REGULARITY  AS AN ALL STAR FOR THE ATLANTA BRAVES IN 2011  WHEN HE LED THE MAJORS IN APPEARANCES WITH 85  HE MISSED TWO WEEKS WITH AN ELBOW IMPINGEMENT THE NEXT JULY  BUT HELPED THE BRAVES REACH THE PLAYOFFS AND PITCHED IN THE 2012 NATIONAL LEAGUE WILD CARD GAME THAT WAS VENTERSS FINAL APPEARANCE IN THE MAJORS UNTIL LAST MONTH  HE UNDERWENT HIS SECOND TOMMY JOHN SURGERY IN 2013  HIS FIRST WAS IN 2005  FIFTEEN MONTHS INTO RECOVERY  IN 2014  VENTERS TORE HIS REBUILT LIGAMENT AGAIN AND NEEDED A THIRD TOMMY JOHN PROCEDURE  THE BRAVES RELEASED HIM AFTER THAT THE 2015 SURGERY COST VENTERS A THIRD FULL SEASON  IN 2016  AFTER FIVE APPEARANCES FOR A RAYS CLASS A TEAM  HE NEEDED ANOTHER ELBOW SURGERY TO REATTACH A LIGAMENT  WHILE THAT OPERATION WAS NOT OFFICIALLY TOMMY JOHN SURGERY  IT SIDELINED HIM FOR THE REST OF THAT SEASON FOR HIM  SINCE 2012  ITS JUST BEEN SETBACK AFTER SETBACK AFTER SETBACK  SAID BRAVES RELIEVER PETER MOYLAN  WHO WAS ONE OF VENTERSS TEAMMATES IN ATLANTA  HES HAD TO FIGHT AND FIGHT  AND THEN IT HAPPENS AGAIN MOYLAN HAS DEALT WITH SIMILAR MEDICAL MISFORTUNE  TWO TOMMY JOHN SURGERIES  A SHOULDER OPERATION AND THREE BACK SURGERIES  MOYLAN WAS A PLAYER COACH IN THE MINORS FOR THE BRAVES IN 2015 BEFORE RE ESTABLISHING HIMSELF ON THE MOUND  TO EVEN HAVE A CHANCE AFTER MULTIPLE BREAKDOWNS  HE SAID  A PITCHER CANNOT WORRY ABOUT RECURRENCE IF YOURE TENTATIVE AND YOURE NOT THROWING THE BALL THE WAY YOU SHOULD  THEN YOURE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE STUFF TO GET BACK TO WHERE YOU NEED TO BE  MOYLAN SAID  YOU CANT THROW 80 PERCENT AND GET BACK TO THE BIG LEAGUES  YOUVE GOT TO GO ALL OUT AND SEE IF ITS GOING TO WORK FOR VENTERS  IT JUST NEVER SEEMED TO WORK  EVEN LAST SEASON  WHEN HE PITCHED AT FOUR LEVELS IN THE RAYS FARM SYSTEM  HE WORKED ONLY 23 INNINGS  BUT THE RAYS KEPT GIVING HIM CHANCES  AND VENTERS KEPT HIS PERSPECTIVE  HE LIVED WITH HIS WIFE AND THREE CHILDREN NEAR THE RAYS COMPLEX IN PORT CHARLOTTE  FLA  REPORTED FOR REHABILITATION WORK IN THE MORNING AND RETURNED TO HIS FAMILY AT NIGHT THERES A LOT OF PEOPLE GOING THROUGH A LOT WORSE THINGS  VENTERS SAID  IM TRYING TO PLAY A GAME

REACH THE BRAVES  HE NEARLY GAVE UP AFTER THE 2016 SURGERY  HE SAID  BUT PERSISTED BECAUSE OF SUPPORT FROM HIS FAMILY  AND A LACK OF MORE APPEALING CAREER OPTIONS I ACTUALLY HAD A LOT OF TIME TO THINK ABOUT THAT  BUT THIS IS ALL IVE EVER KNOWN  VENTERS SAID  I THOUGHT ABOUT COACHING  THAT WOULD BE A POSSIBILITY  BUT THERE WAS NEVER ANYTHING THAT I WANTED TO DO OTHER THAN THIS  TO BE HONEST WITH YOU  ITS ALL I KNOW  THERE WAS NO REAL GREAT BACKUP PLAN  THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF DESPERATION IN THERE  TOO  BACKED INTO A CORNER AT HIS BEST  VENTERS FRUSTRATED HITTERS WITH A HARD  SINKING FASTBALL AT AROUND 95 MILES PER HOUR  HE HAS LOST TWO OR THREE M P H  SINCE HIS ALL STAR PEAK  MY STUFFS NOT AS LIFE Y AS IT USED TO BE  HE SAID   BUT HE STILL THROWS HARD ENOUGH  WITH ENOUGH MOXIE  TO COMPETE  ACCORDING TO FANGRAPHS  VENTERS IS BELIEVED TO BE ONLY THE SECOND PITCHER WITH THREE DOCUMENTED TOMMY JOHN SURGERIES TO RETURN TO THE MAJORS  AFTER JASON ISRINGHAUSEN IT SURPRISES ME THAT ANYBODY WOULD HAVE THAT PERSEVERANCE  TO GO THROUGH WHAT JONNY WENT THROUGH  SAID BRIAN SNITKER  THE BRAVES MANAGER  WHO COACHED FOR ATLANTA WHEN VENTERS PLAYED THERE  HE NEEDS TO WRITE A BOOK OR HIRE HIMSELF OUT AS A MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER OR SOMETHING  AND NOW HIS BOYS ARE OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT WENT ON AND SEE DAD PITCH  SO THATS REALLY COOL  BECAUSE HES SUCH A WONDERFUL KID VENTERS AND HIS WIFE  VIVIANA

THE POSITION  WHO CAUGHT THAT LINE DRIVE FROM THE CHICAGO CUBS WILLSON CONTRERAS   IT WAS CHARLIE CULBERSON  WHO WAS PLAYING THERE BECAUSE A BACK INJURY HAD FORCED SEAGER TO MISS THE NATIONAL LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES NOW  THE DODGERS WILL HAVE TO WIN AGAIN WITHOUT SEAGER  AND FOR A MUCH LONGER STRETCH  SEAGERS SEASON IS OVER BECAUSE OF AN ELBOW INJURY THAT REQUIRES TOMMY JOHN SURGERY  AND WHILE IT IS EASY TO IMAGINE A DEAL FOR BALTIMORES MANNY MACHADO AS A REPLACEMENT  THE DODGERS SEEM UNLIKELY TO TRADE PREMIUM PROSPECTS FOR A PLAYER FACING FREE AGENCY NEXT WINTER  BESIDES  THEIR PROBLEMS RUN DEEPER THAN SHORTSTOP CONSIDER THE DODGERS ROSTER FOR THEIR WORLD SERIES LOSS TO HOUSTON LAST FALL  OF THOSE 25 PLAYERS  SIX ARE GONE  CULBERSON  YU DARVISH  ANDRE ETHIER  BRANDON MCCARTHY

STINTS WITH THE TORONTO AND MILWAUKEE ORGANIZATIONS  IN THE VENEZUELAN WINTER LEAGUE AND  FOR EIGHT GAMES IN 2007  WITH THE LONG ISLAND DUCKS OF THE ATLANTIC LEAGUE  ACUNA SR  PEAKED AT CLASS AA  BUT NOT FOR LACK OF TALENT HE HAD A LOT OF TOOLS  AND HE COULD DO A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING  SAID JIM DUQUETTE  WHO WAS THE METS GENERAL MANAGER IN 2004  WE THOUGHT HED BE A BIG LEAGUER  AND WE HELD ON TO HIM FOR A LONG TIME ACUNA SR  HAD EXCELLENT SPEED  AVERAGING 29 STEALS PER YEAR IN THE METS SYSTEM  AND A STRONG ARM  INTERNALLY  DUQUETTE SAID  THE METS BELIEVED ACUNA COULD BE SIMILAR TO RAUL MONDESI  THE LONGTIME MAJOR LEAGUE OUTFIELDER  AS LONG AS HE DEVELOPED POWER BUT ACUNA SR  HIT JUST FIVE HOME RUNS IN NEARLY 1 800 CAREER AT BATS IN CLASS AA  ACUNA JR  A LEFT FIELDER WHO WAS CONSIDERED THE MAJORS BEST PROSPECT BEFORE HIS PROMOTION LAST MONTH  HIT 21 HOMERS IN THREE LEVELS OF THE MINORS LAST SEASON THE POWER TOOL APPARENTLY SKIPS A GENERATION  DUQUETTE SAID  ADDING THAT CONCERNS ABOUT WORK ETHIC ALSO HELD BACK ACUNA SR WE DIDNT WANT TO REWARD A GUY BY SENDING HIM TO TRIPLE A WHEN HE WASNT WORKING HARD  HE SAID  WE THOUGHT THAT WAS A BAD MESSAGE TO SEND  AND WE ALSO THOUGHT IT COULD BE MOTIVATION  BUT DOUBLE A WAS HIS MAJOR LEAGUES  AND GETTING OUT OF DOUBLE A IS THE GREAT EQUALIZER  THE GOOD PLAYERS GET TO DOUBLE A  AND THEN THE BEST MOVE ON FROM THERE ACUNA JR  SOARED THROUGH CLASS AA  SPENDING JUST 57 GAMES THERE LAST SEASON  COMPARED WITH 485 FOR HIS FATHER  ACUNA JR  WHO IS FROM VENEZUELA  BELIEVES HIS BROTHERS COULD JOIN HIM IN SURPASSING THEIR FATHERS

WICKED SLIDER AND FASTBALL  HADER IS SIMILARLY TERRIFYING FOR HITTERS  ON MONDAY  HADER DID SOMETHING NO PITCHER HAS DONE SINCE JOHNSON IN A GAME AGAINST THE CINCINNATI REDS  HADER RECORDED THE MAJOR LEAGUES FIRST EIGHT STRIKEOUT SAVE SINCE JOHNSON DID IT FOR SEATTLE IN 1996  WHEN A BACK INJURY LIMITED HIM TO BULLPEN WORK  JOHNSON WOULD DOUBLE THAT TOTAL IN AN UNUSUAL RELIEF APPEARANCE ON JULY 19  2001  THAT EARNED  A WIN FOR HIM AND THE SINGLE GAME RECORD FOR STRIKEOUTS BY A RELIEVER  WITH 16 THE GAME HAD BEGUN THE NIGHT BEFORE  WITH CURT SCHILLING STARTING FOR ARIZONA IN SAN DIEGO  ELECTRICAL EXPLOSIONS IN A LIGHT TOWER AT QUALCOMM STADIUM CAUSED THE GAME TO BE SUSPENDED IN THE THIRD INNING  WHEN THE PADRES ARRIVED AT THE BALLPARK TO RESUME THE GAME THE NEXT DAY  THEY LEARNED JOHNSON WOULD BE TAKING OVER FOR SCHILLING I REMEMBER THINKING  OH GREAT  INSTEAD OF BEING A BULLPEN GAME  ITS GOING TO BE A RANDY JOHNSON GAME  SAID PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES BROADCASTER BEN DAVIS  THEN A CATCHER FOR THE PADRES  CURT SCHILLING AND RANDY JOHNSON IN THE SAME GAME  TALK ABOUT A TWO HEADED MONSTER SCHILLING HAD ALLOWED NO HITS  AND JOHNSON EXTENDED THE NO HITTER INTO THE EIGHTH INNING  LOSING IT ON A TWO OUT SINGLE BY WIKI GONZALEZ  JOHNSON SET THE RELIEF STRIKEOUT RECORD BY FANNING DAVIS TO END THE GAME  IN HIS CAREER OFF JOHNSON  DAVIS WAS 1 FOR 15 OFF WITH 11 STRIKEOUTS  THOUGH THE ONE HIT WAS A HOME RUN I DID HIT THE HOME RUN  WHICH IS THE ONLY THING I REMEMBER  I DONT REMEMBER ALL THE STRIKEOUTS  DAVIS SAID  LAUGHING  BUT FOR RANDY TO DO IT WITH TWO PITCHES  98 MILE AN HOUR FASTBALL AND A 92 MILE AN HOUR SLIDER  YOU THOUGHT  WELL  ITS A 50 PERCENT CHANCE  BUT HE DIDNT JUST THROW HARD  HE COULD LOCATE AS WELL  AND FROM HIS ARM ANGLE AND RELEASE POINT  HE WAS THROWING FROM LIKE 50  51 FEET WHEN HE GOT DONE JOHNSON KEPT ON GOING THAT SEASON  OF COURSE  BEATING THE YANKEES THREE TIMES IN THE WORLD SERIES TO LIFT THE DIAMONDBACKS TO THEIR ONLY CHAMPIONSHIP  INCLUDING THE POSTSEASON

OUR CIRCLE OF COMPETENCE   WE RE GOING TO MISS A LOT OF THINGS I MADE THE WRONG DECISION ON GOOGLE AND AMAZON MUNGER   I VE BEEN TO GOOGLE HEADQUARTERS   IT LOOKS LIKE A KINDERGARTEN ON CORPORATE PROFITS AMERICAN INDUSTRY HAS GOTTEN INCREDIBLY MORE PROFITABLE IN AGGREGATE IN THE LAST 20 30 YEARS   THIS HAS BECOME SOMEWHAT AN ASSET LIGHT ECONOMY   IT IS A CHANGING WORLD AND  THE BIGGEST COMPANIES  WILL EARN EVEN MORE MONEY WITH THE TAX RATE GOING DOWN  ON BERKSHIRE S COMPANY CULTURE I VE BEEN ON 19 BOARDS  AND I VE NEVER SEEN A BOARD LIKE OURS   IT S A GROUP OF OWNER ORIENTED  BERKSHIRE CONSCIOUS  BUSINESS SAVVY OWNERS   PEOPLE OPT INTO IT TO A GREAT DEAL ON APPLE S CASH HOARD IT S EXTREMELY HARD TO FIND ACQUISITIONS THAT WOULD BE ACCRETIVE TO APPLE  IN  THE   BILLION RANGE  AS I LOOK AROUND THE HORIZON  I DON T SEE ANYTHING THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR THEM  WHEREAS I DO SEE A BUSINESS THAT THEY KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT   I M DELIGHTED TO SEE THEM REPURCHASING SHARES   MENTALLY  YOU CAN SAY WE OWN 5 PERCENT OF IT   OVER THE PASSAGE OF TIME  WE MAY OWN 6 OR 7 PERCENT BECAUSE THEY REPURCHASE SHARES  ON BNSF RAILROAD WE GET A DECENT RETURN ON THE CAPITAL INTENSIVE BUSINESSES  WE BOUGHT MOST AT DECENT PRICES AND THEY VE BEEN RUN VERY WELL ON NEWSPAPERSNO ONE EXCEPT THE WALL STREET JOURNAL  THE NEW YORK TIMES AND  NOW  THE WASHINGTON POST HAS COME UP WITH A DIGITAL PRODUCT THAT WILL IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY REPLACE THE REVENUE BEING LOST AS PRINT NEWSPAPERS LOSE CIR AND ADVERTISING   THE JOURNAL  THE TIMES AND PROBABLY THE POST HAVE AN ECONOMICALLY VIABLE MODEL IN THE DIGITAL WORLD WHERE THE DAILY NEWSPAPER WAS A PRIMARY  SOURCE OF INFORMATION  THEY RE NO LONGER PRIMARY ON U S  EXCEPTIONALISM THIS COUNTRY REALLY  REALLY WORKS   THIS COUNTRY HAS SIX TIMES THE PER CAPITA GDP GROWTH THAT IT HAD WHEN I WAS BORN   THIS IS A REMARKABLE  REMARKABLE COUNTRY   I WOULD LOVE TO BE A BABY BORN IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY  ON CRYPTOCURRENCIES BEING A BUBBLE THEY RE  NON PRODUCTIVE ASSETS  IT ESSENTIALLY WILL NOT DELIVER ANYTHING OTHER THAN SUPPOSED SCARCITY  WHAT DOES IT PRODUCE ITSELF    ANYTIME YOU BUY NON PRODUCTIVE ASSETS  YOU ARE COUNTING ON SOMEONE LATER ON BUYING A NON PRODUCTIVE ASSET  IT DOES COME TO A BAD ENDING   CRYPTOCURRENCIES WILL COME TO BAD ENDINGS ON REINSURANCE WE WILL BE IN THE REINSURANCE BUSINESS 5 YEARS FROM NOW  10 YEARS FROM NOW  20 YEARS FROM NOW   IT WILL BE SUBJECT TO MORE UPS AND DOWNS THAN SOMETHING LIKE GEICO   BUT IT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF BERKSHIRE ON WELLS FARGO SCANDAL WELLS FARGO IS A COMPANY THAT PROVED THE EFFICACY OF INCENTIVES  AND IT S JUST THAT THEY JUST HAD THE WRONG INCENTIVES   THE FACT THAT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS AT SOME LARGE INSTITUTIONS IS NOT UNIQUE   I SEE NO REASON WHY WELLS FARGO AS A COMPANY   GOING FORWARD IS IN ANY WAY INFERIOR TO THE OTHER BIG BANKS WITH WHICH IT COMPETES  WE HAVE A LARGE UNREALIZED GAIN  IN THE STOCK  I LIKE IT AS AN INVESTMENT   THE CEO  IS CORRECTING MISTAKES MADE BY OTHER PEOPLE ON MEASURING EFFECT OF TAX CUTS IT S VERY  VERY DIFFICULT IN ECONOMICS TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF SINGLE VARIABLES  EVERY QUESTION YOU GET IN ECONOMICS  YOU SHOULD THEN SAY   AND THEN WHAT  ON HEALTHCARE PARTNERSHIP WITH JPMORGAN AND AMAZON COM  WE SIMPLY HAVE THREE ORGANIZATIONS WITH LEADERS I ADMIRE AND TRUST   WE HAVE A HUGELY NON COMPETITIVE MEDICAL COST IN AMERICAN BUSINESS RELATING TO ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD   THE MOTIVATIONS ARE NOT PRIMARILY PROFIT MAKING  WE WANT OUR EMPLOYEES TO GET BETTER MEDICAL SERVICES AT LOWER COST   WE KNOW THE RESISTANCE WILL BE UNBELIEVABLE  AND IF WE FAIL   AT LEAST WE TRIED  I THINK WE LL PROBABLY HAVE A CEO WITHIN A COUPLE OF MONTHS ON GE INVESTMENT IN 2008 WE PROBABLY COULD VE EXTRACTED BETTER TERMS  IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN COUNTERPRODUCTIVE IN THE END   WE COULD HAVE MADE BETTER PURCHASES 3 4 MONTHS LATER  WE DIDN T PUSH IT TO THE LIMIT ON USING CASH FOR A SPECIAL DIVIDEND WE HAD A VOTE ON WHETHER PEOPLE WANTED A DIVIDEND   THE B SHARES VOTED 47 1 AGAINST IT  THEY EXPECT US TO DO WHATEVER WE THINK MAKES SENSE FOR ALL SHAREHOLDERS  AND IF WE THOUGHT WE CAN T USE THE MONEY EFFECTIVELY IN THE BUSINESS  WE SHOULD GET IT OUT   WE WON T ALWAYS BE IN A WORLD OF LOW INTEREST RATES OR HIGH PRIVATE MARKET PRICES   IT S VERY UNLIKELY WE D PAY OUT A BIG SPECIAL DIVIDEND ON PRICING RISK THE KIND OF RISK THAT YOU CAN T REALLY LOOK UP IN A BOOK AND SEE ACTUARIALLY  I ENJOY THINKING THROUGH THE PRICING OF THAT ON INFLATION LONG TERM BONDS ARE A TERRIBLE INVESTMENT AT CURRENT RATES  OR ANYTHING CLOSE TO CURRENT RATES  RATES  ON SHORT TERM BILLS  HAVE GONE UP LATELY  SO IN 2018 MY GUESS IS WE LL HAVE AT LEAST  MILLION  MORE  IN PRE TAX INCOME THAN WE HAD LAST YEAR ON DEALS I DO NOT WORRY ABOUT THE SLOWING DEAL FLOW  MY PHONE IS NOT RINGING OFF THE HOOK WITH GOOD DEALS BUT WE WILL STILL BE THE FIRST  POINT  OF CALL  IRRESPECTIVE OF ME OR CHARLIE NOT BEING THERE  ON INVESTING IN GUN MANUFACTURERS  I DO NOT BELIEVE IN IMPOSING MY POLITICAL OPINIONS ON THE ACTIVITIES OF OUR BUSINESSES ON KRAFT HEINZ THE 3G PEOPLE HAVE GONE INTO CERTAIN SITUATIONS WHERE THERE WERE PROBABLY   A LOT OF EXPENSES THAT WERE NOT DELIVERING A DOLLAR OF VALUE FOR A DOLLAR EXPENDED  THEY MADE CHANGES VERY FAST TO A SITUATION THAT PROBABLY SHOULDN T HAVE EXISTED IN THE FIRST PLACE OUR MANAGERS HAVE DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES OF KEEPING TRACK OF TRYING TO MAXIMIZE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY DON T INCUR OTHER THAN NECESSARY COSTS CONSUMER PACKAGED GOODS ARE STILL A TERRIFIC BUSINESS ON GEICO  THE GROWTH DID SLOW DOWN  BUT ITS NOT BECAUSE WE WANTED IT TO  IF YOU LOOK AT THE FIRST QUARTER  OUR MARGINS WERE AROUND 7 PERCENT  WHICH IS ACTUALLY A LITTLE MORE THAN WE AIMED FOR  THE UNDERWRITING GAINS FOR MARGINS ARE PERFECTLY SATISFACTORY NOW  AND WEVE GAINED MARKET SHARE HERE AND MARKET SHARE THERE  WE WILL KEEP GAINING MARKET SHARE   GEICO IS A JEWEL  ITS AN INCREDIBLE COMPANY  ITS SAVING ITS CUSTOMERS PROBABLY  5 BILLION A YEAR AGAINST WHAT THEY WOULD BE PAYING OTHERWISE ON PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP S PROPOSED TARIFFSBUFFETT   WE VE SEEN STEEL COSTS INCREASE SOMEWHAT  I DON T THINK EITHER  THE U S  OR CHINA  WILL DIG THEMSELVES INTO SOMETHING THAT PRECIPITATES AND CONTINUES ANY REAL TRADE WAR   THE BENEFITS OF TRADE ARE BASICALLY NOT VISIBLE  NO ONE THINKS ABOUT BENEFITS DAY BY DAY   THE NEGATIVES  AND THERE ARE NEGATIVES  ARE VERY APPARENT AND VERY PAINFUL MUNGER   THE CONDITIONS IN STEEL WERE ALMOST UNBELIEVABLY ADVERSE TO THE AMERICAN STEEL INDUSTRY  EVEN DONALD TRUMP CAN BE RIGHT ON SOME OF THIS STUFF ON CHINA U S  TRADE IN AUGUST  I WILL BE 88  IN A YEAR THAT ENDS IN AN 8  EIGHT IS A LUCKY NUMBER IN CHINA    THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA ARE GOING TO BE THE TWO SUPERPOWERS OF THE WORLD  ECONOMICALLY AND IN OTHER WAYS FOR A LONG  LONG  LONG TIME  WE HAVE A LOT OF COMMON INTERESTS AND LIKE ANY TWO BIG ECONOMIC ENTITIES THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THERE WILL BE TENSIONS  BUT IT IS A WIN WIN SITUATION WHEN THE WORLD TRADES ON BERKSHIRE IN 50 YEARS I THINK THE REPUTATION OF BERKSHIRE BEING A GOOD HOME FOR COMPANIES   I DON T THINK THAT S DEPENDENT ON ME AND CHARLIE THE ANSWER IS I DON T KNOW  AND I DIDN T KNOW WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE 50 YEARS AGO   WE WILL BE AS SHAREHOLDER ORIENTED AS ANY LARGE COMPANY IN THE WORLD  WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL BE

20180501,business,market,10,SOME IDEAS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS  SOME EVEN GROW SO LARGE THAT THEY TURN INTO PARADIGMS  THEIR LOGIC ORGANIZING THE WAY WE SEE EVERYTHING AROUND THEM  AND IF YOURE UNCERTAIN WHAT FRAMEWORK DOMINATES MODERN LIFE  WELL  YOU CAN TAKE IT FROM THE TED CONFERENCE FIXTURE AND ADVERTISING FOR HUMANITY FOUNDER DAN PALLOTTA  WHO PUT IT BLUNTLY ENOUGH IN A 2011 ARTICLE FOR HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW  BRAND IS EVERYTHING  AND EVERYTHING IS BRAND HE WAS WRITING IN THE SERVICE OF BUILDING HIS OWN BRAND  WHICH IS ABOUT REBRANDING OTHER PEOPLES BRANDS  THE BRAND  IN FACT  IS SUCH A UBIQUITOUS ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE FOR SO MANY THINGS  COMPANIES  PRODUCTS  PEOPLE  THAT IT HAS BEEN FORCED TO SPAWN AN EXPANSIVE GLOSSARY OF SUBCATEGORIES AND VARIETIES  THERE ARE PUBLIC BRANDS  CIVIC INSTITUTIONS  BRAND EXTENSIONS  NEW PRODUCTS FROM EXISTING BRANDS  FIGHTER BRANDS  CHEAPER BRANDS RELEASED BY COSTLIER BRANDS TO REATTRACT LOST BRAND LOYALTY  AND BRAND LEADERS  THE VERY BEST BRANDS  EVEN ASPECTS OF BRANDING ITSELF ARE BRANDED  WITH BRAND MANAGERS  MARKETERS  BUILDING BRAND EQUITY  LIKABILITY  THROUGH THE CULTIVATION OF BRANDFACE  THE WAY THE CONSUMER SEES HERSELF WHEN SHE ENGAGES WITH THE BRAND  THE APOTHEOSIS OF ALL THIS MIGHT BE THE LIFESTYLE BRAND  A CORPORATE BID TO ESCAPE THE HUMDRUM REALITY OF SELLING PRODUCTS AND INSTEAD MARKET AN ENTIRE WAY OF BEING  TACO BELL IS ENTERING THE CATEGORY WITH A FOREVER 21 CLOTHING LINE TARGETED AT MAKING WARDROBES A WHOLE LOT SAUCIER  LEXUS HAS CHASED THE LUXURY LIFESTYLE INTO THE SEA BY INTRODUCING A YACHT  A VICE PRESIDENT FOR GOOD FOODS DESCRIBES ITS GUACAMOLE AS PART OF A LIFESTYLE BRAND THAT ADDS OPTIMUM NUTRITION AND WELLNESS  ALONG WITH THE FUN FACTOR THAT CAN BE ENJOYED DURING HOLIDAYS LIKE CINCO DE MAYO ANYTHING THAT CAN BE CONSUMED IS NOW UNDERSTOOD AS A BRAND  AND ON THE INTERNET  THATS EVERY LAST BIT OF CONTENT  THIS IS HOW A CONSULTANT LIKE ERIC GARLAND CAN  ON THE STRENGTH OF A VIRAL TWEET STORM ABOUT THE GAME THEORY BEHIND AMERICAN POLITICS  BRAND HIMSELF AS A RUSSIAN CONSPIRACY SAGE AND MARKET SUBSCRIPTIONS TO  GAMETHEORYTODAY  ITS ALSO WHY ACTUAL BRANDS  LIKE HAMBURGER HELPER OR DENNYS  HANG AROUND SOCIAL MEDIA MASQUERADING AS PEOPLE  POSTING JOKES AND MEMES AND ROASTING HATERS  EVEN THE MOST CYNICAL INTERNET USERS SPEAK SEMISERIOUSLY ABOUT OUR POSTS BEING ON BRAND OR OFF BRAND  THERE IS NO REFUGE FROM THE LOGIC OF THE BRAND  AND IF THERE IS  SOME UP AND COMING STRATEGIST WILL SOON ENOUGH BOLSTER HER OWN BRAND BY COLONIZING IT CORPORATE BRANDING FIRST EMERGED AS A PRACTICAL MEASURE  IN THE 1920S  THE RISE OF AMERICAN CONSUMER CULTURE PRODUCED A GLUT OF PRODUCTS THAT COULDNT BE DIFFERENTIATED FROM ONE ANOTHER ON SIGHT  THE BRANDING THAT EMERGED AROUND THEM HAS  AT POINTS  HAD A GLIMMER OF UTILITY TO IT  SERVING AS A WAY TO ESTABLISH THE AUTHENTICITY AND RELIABILITY OF A PARTICULAR THING FROM A PARTICULAR SOURCE  BUT THE IDEA OF A BRAND RAPIDLY SPREAD BEYOND THAT SEAL OF QUALITY AND SUBSUMED A WHOLE CONSTELLATION OF SENTIMENTS A COMPANY MIGHT PROVOKE IN A PERSON  MANY OF THEM WHOLLY ABSTRACTED FROM THE PRODUCT ITSELF  IN HER 1999 BOOK  NO LOGO  NAOMI KLEIN PRESENTS THE ACCELERATION OF CORPORATE BRANDING AS A KIND OF HOLLOWING OUT  COMPANIES THAT USED TO MANUFACTURE WARES OR HARVEST FOODS  THAT USED TO SELL THINGS  BECAME BRANDS  WHICH SELL IDEAS  ACTUAL PRODUCTION PROCESSES BECAME SECONDARY  OUTSOURCED TO FAR FLUNG SUBCONTRACTORS  THE BRANDS REAL INVESTMENT WAS TO IMBUE THE PRODUCTS WITH MEANING  NIKE ISNT A RUNNING SHOE COMPANY  KLEIN WROTE IN THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION  IT IS ABOUT THE IDEA OF TRANSCENDENCE THROUGH SPORTS AT ITS CORE  BRANDING IS A PROCESS OF HUMANIZATION  IT IMBUES COMPANIES WITH PERSONALITIES  OFTEN THE PERSONIFICATION IS OVERT  ONCE THERE WERE AUNT JEMIMA AND BETTY CROCKER  NOW THERES THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION AND FENTY BEAUTY  AS THE CELEBRITY ADMAN BRUCE BARTON ONCE SAID  INSTITUTIONS HAVE SOULS  JUST AS MEN AND NATIONS HAVE SOULS  A COMPANY WITH A SOUL BECOMES RELATABLE  BUT IN A DECEPTIVE WAY  THE MORE WE THINK OF IT AS A BRAND  THE MORE OUR FOCUS SHIFTS AWAY FROM THINGS LIKE LABOR PRACTICES AND SUPPLY CHAINS AND ONTO ISSUES OF NARRATIVE AND IDENTITY SO WENDYS  WHICH USED TO BE PERSONIFIED BY A LITTLE RED HAIRED GIRL OR BY ITS FOUNDER  DAVE THOMAS  IS NOW PERSONIFIED BY A SOCIAL MEDIA TEAM RENOWNED FOR ITS ABILITY TO TWEET LIKE A RUDE TEENAGER  BUT IF COMPANIES HAVE COME TO ACT MORE LIKE PEOPLE  THE REVERSE IS ALSO TRUE  NOW PEOPLE ACT LIKE COMPANIES  CAREFULLY MONITORING THE MEANINGS WE PROJECT INTO THE WORLD  THE BRAND MANAGEMENT OF THE WENDYS TEAM HAPPENS RIGHT ALONGSIDE THAT OF ACTUAL TEENAGERS  WHO SHAPE THEIR IMAGES TO ATTRACT ATTENTION AND GOOD WILL  BUILD UP ENOUGH OF THOSE THINGS  AND A PERSON  MUCH LIKE A COMPANY  CAN BECOME PROFITABLE  A BLOCKBUSTER PERSONA LIKE RIHANNAS MIGHT TRANSLATE INTO THE MARKETABILITY OF A  BODY LUMINIZER  A BACHELOR CONTESTANTS PERSONA MIGHT BE LIMITED TO ENDORSING HERBAL SUPPLEMENTS ON INSTAGRAM  A POPULAR INTERNET FIGURE MIGHT SIMPLY CROWDFUND TO COVER EXPENSES  COMPANIES STILL TRY TO SELL US THINGS  BUT NOW WERE ENCOURAGED TO PITCH OURSELVES TO THEM  TOO  A LIFESTYLE BRAND  AFTER ALL  IS JUST A REGULAR BRAND THAT APPEALS TO PEOPLES PERSONAL BRANDS  WHICH  IN TURN  ARE INCREASINGLY ORGANIZED AROUND COURTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH LIFESTYLE BRANDS  IT ALL COLLAPSES INTO BRANDING PERSONAL BRAND WAS COINED BY A WRITER NAMED TOM PETERS IN A FAST COMPANY ARTICLE  THE BRAND CALLED YOU  THIS WAS IN 1997  AS LIFESTYLE BRANDING WAS BEGINNING TO EMERGE  ALL KINDS OF PRODUCTS  PETERS WROTE  ARE FIGURING OUT HOW TO TRANSCEND THE NARROW BOUNDARIES OF THEIR CATEGORIES AND BECOME A BRAND SURROUNDED BY TOMMY HILFIGER LIKE BUZZ  AT THE END OF THE ESSAY  HE PLUGGED HIS NEW CD ROM PART OF WHAT PETERS ENVISIONED WAS HUMAN BEINGS THINKING OF THEMSELVES IN THE SAME WAY  THE INTERNET HAD MADE PEOPLE IDENTICAL  TOO  JUST MESSAGES STACKED IN A VIRTUAL BOX  LIKE THE SNACKS AND SNEAKERS THAT CAME BEFORE THEM  THEY NEEDED WAYS TO DIFFERENTIATE THEMSELVES  WHERE THE BRAND CALLED YOU BECOMES FASCINATING  THOUGH  IS WHEN IT APPLIES THIS LOGIC TO EMPLOYMENT  PETERS SAW PERSONAL BRANDING AS A WAY TO LIBERATE YOURSELF FROM THE CONSTRAINTS OF CORPORATE LIFE  HE DESCRIBED LIFELONG STEADY EMPLOYMENT AS WHAT WE USED TO CALL INDENTURED SERVITUDE  IN ITS PLACE  HE HAILED THE EMERGENCE OF A NEW PROJECT WORLD  WHERE WORK IS ORGANIZED INTO BITE SIZED PACKETS  TO THRIVE IN SUCH A WORLD  HE ENCOURAGED READERS TO COLLECT AND MARKET SKILLS AND CONNECTIONS  TO THROW OUT THEIR RSUMS IN FAVOR OF A MARKETING BROCHURE FOR BRAND YOU HE IMAGINED EMPOWERED WORKERS DIVESTING THEMSELVES FROM CORPORATE DRUDGERY  BUT WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED WAS THE OPPOSITE  OUR CORPORATIONS DIVESTED FROM US  OVER THE TWO DECADES SINCE THE BRAND CALLED YOU  FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT HAS STEADILY ATOMIZED INTO CASUAL  PART TIME AND TEMPORARY WORK  CULMINATING IN THE PROJECT WORLD OF THE GIG ECONOMY  MICROJOBS DRIVING FOR UBER  RUNNING ERRANDS FOR TASKRABBIT OR COOKING UP SIDE HUSTLES ON FIVERR  A COMPANY WHOSE SUBWAY ADS GLAMORIZE PITILESS OVERWORK  SLEEP DEPRIVATION IS YOUR DRUG OF CHOICE  DESPITE ITS BEING NAMED AFTER A WOEFULLY SMALL AMOUNT OF CASH THE OPPORTUNITIES TO MARKET OURSELVES ONLINE ARE NEVER ENDING  BUT THE FINANCIAL REWARDS REMAIN

20180506,business,market,1,WHY DID WHITE WORKING CLASS VOTERS SHIFT TOWARD DONALD TRUMP IN THE 2016 ELECTION  WAS IT ABOUT MONEY OR CULTURE  THEIR STRUGGLES IN THE NEW ECONOMY OR THEIR PREJUDICES A RECENT ARTICLE IN PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES BY DIANA C  MUTZ COMES DOWN ON THE SIDE OF CULTURE  DR  MUTZ STUDIED THE RESPONSES OF VOTERS WHO WERE INTERVIEWED IN OCTOBER 2012 AND OCTOBER 2016  FOCUSING ON THOSE WHO SWITCHED THEIR SUPPORT FROM BARACK OBAMA TO MR  TRUMP  SHE ARGUES THAT THESE WHITE VOTERS TURNED TO MR  TRUMP NOT BECAUSE THEIR ECONOMIC SITUATION HAD DETERIORATED BUT BECAUSE THEY WERE INCREASINGLY ANXIOUS ABOUT WHETHER THEY COULD HOLD ON TO THEIR DOMINANT SOCIAL POSITION OTHER SCHOLARS HAVE MADE SIMILAR CLAIMS  A REPORT BASED ON A 2016 NATIONAL SURVEY CONCLUDED THAT THE WHITE WORKING CLASS TILT TOWARD MR  TRUMP OCCURRED BECAUSE OF FEARS OF CULTURAL DISPLACEMENT RATHER THAN ECONOMIC HARDSHIP  THREE POLITICAL SCIENTISTS ARGUED THAT THE SHIFT REPRESENTED AN IDENTITY CRISIS AMONG WHITES WITHOUT COLLEGE EDUCATIONS THAT WAS ROOTED IN THEIR FEAR THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS AND IMMIGRANTS WERE UNDERMINING THEIR POSITION AS THE MAJORITY GROUP THESE CONCLUSIONS  FAITHFUL AS THEY MAY BE TO THE SURVEY DATA THAT UNDERLIE THEM  EXEMPLIFY A MISGUIDED DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER CULTURE OR ECONOMICS WAS THE DRIVING FORCE IN MR  TRUMPS WIN  TO BE SURE  RACISM IS A CORROSIVE PART OF AMERICAN CULTURE AND POLITICS  NEVERTHELESS  THOSE WHO TRY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE EXPLANATORY POWER OF STAGNANT WAGES AND A DECLINING INDUSTRIAL BASE ON THE ONE HAND  AND ANXIETIES ABOUT THE ASCENT OF MINORITY GROUPS ON THE OTHER  MISS THE POINT  THESE ARE NOT TWO DIFFERENT FACTORS BUT TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN RECEIVE THE DAYS MOST URGENT DEBATES RIGHT IN YOUR INBOX BY SUBSCRIBING TO THE OPINION TODAY NEWSLETTER COLLEGE EDUCATED AMERICANS SPEAK ABOUT THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS OF THE WORKING CLASS IN TERMS OF TRENDS THAT CAN BE SEEN IN TABLES AND GRAPHS  THOSE ON THE LEFT CRITICIZE THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE AS BEING TOO LOW  WHILE THOSE ON THE RIGHT BEMOAN THE EROSION OF WORK INCENTIVES  BUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING THESE ADVERSE ECONOMIC TRENDS EXPRESS THEMSELVES DIFFERENTLY  USING A MORAL LANGUAGE THAT IS OFTEN ROOTED IN ATTITUDES ABOUT WORK AND RACE THIS WAS FIRST NOTED BY THE SOCIOLOGIST MICHLE LAMONT IN HER BOOK THE DIGNITY OF WORKING MEN  SHE FOUND THAT WHITE WORKING CLASS MEN OFTEN DEFINE THEIR SELF WORTH THROUGH THEIR ABILITY TO LEAD DISCIPLINED  RESPONSIBLE LIVES  THEY TAKE PRIDE IN GOING TO WORK EVERY DAY TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES  MANY OF THEM VIEW AFRICAN AMERICANS AS NOT WANTING TO WORK HARD  THEY RARELY CONSIDER THAT THEIR OWN ADVANTAGES REST ON THE PRIVILEGED POSITION OF WHITES IN THE LABOR MARKET IN THIS WAY  THEY CONSTRUCT A POSITIVE SENSE OF SELF DESPITE THE LIMITS OF THEIR ECONOMIC CLASS  PERCHED PRECARIOUSLY ABOVE THE POOR  THEY TALK NOT ABOUT THEIR MODEST INCOMES BUT RATHER ABOUT THEIR SUPERIOR WORK DISCIPLINE  IN PROSPEROUS TIMES  THEY CAN TAKE PRIDE IN THEIR SUCCESS COMPARED WITH MINORITIES BUT WHEN THAT PROSPERITY IS THREATENED  THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT BLACKS OR IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE  IN THEIR MINDS  USURPING THEIR PLACE IN THE ECONOMY  IN A 2017 SURVEY  24 PERCENT OF WHITES WITHOUT COLLEGE DEGREES RESPONDED THAT THEY HAD BEEN PERSONALLY DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN APPLYING FOR JOBS BECAUSE THEY WERE WHITE  ALTHOUGH STRONG EVIDENCE EXISTS THAT IT IS ACTUALLY BLACKS WHO ARE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST THE ECONOMIC DISTRESS OF THE WHITE WORKING CLASS HAS BEEN BUILDING SINCE THE 1970S  WHAT WAS NEW IN 2016 WAS A CANDIDATE  MR  TRUMP  WHO SPOKE ABOUT THAT DISTRESS NOT IN THE LANGUAGE OF A COLLEGE GRADUATE BUT AS A WORKING CLASS PERSON MIGHT  HE EXPLOITED VOTERS FEELING THAT THEY WERE BEING LEFT BEHIND BY A DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT SEEMINGLY FAVORED BLACKS AND IMMIGRANTS IN ADDITION  WHEN WHITE WORKING CLASS INDIVIDUALS DO TALK ABOUT THEIR STANDARD OF LIVING  ITS NOT NECESSARILY THOSE WITH THE LOWEST INCOMES WHO SPEAK THE LOUDEST  MORE IMPORTANT THAN HOW MUCH THEY EARN IS THEIR SENSE OF HOW THEY ARE DOING COMPARED WITH THE STANDARD OF LIVING OF THEIR PARENTS GENERATION  THOSE WHO SEE THEMSELVES AS DOWNWARDLY MOBILE ARE THE UNHAPPIEST WORKING CLASS WHITES WITH STEADY EMPLOYMENT MAY NEVERTHELESS CONSIDER THEMSELVES WORSE OFF BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS MADE HIGH  UNIONIZED WAGES THAT ARE MOSTLY OUT OF REACH TODAY  THOSE WITH LOWER INCOMES MAY NOT HAVE EXPECTED AS MUCH  IN OTHER WORDS  WHAT MATTERS IS NOT THE SIZE OF YOUR PAYCHECK BUT WHETHER IT ALLOWS FOR THE STANDARD OF LIVING YOU THINK YOU ARE ENTITLED TO THE DEBATE OVER WHY THE WHITE WORKING CLASS SUPPORTED MR  TRUMP RAISES A QUESTION  WHY DO WE CARE SO MUCH ABOUT DETERMINING PRECISELY HOW MUCH POLITICAL UPHEAVAL IS DUE TO ECONOMICS AND HOW MUCH IS DUE TO CULTURE PERHAPS WE ARE DRAWN TO THIS FUTILE QUEST BECAUSE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS SEEM MORE TRACTABLE  MORE EASILY DEALT WITH THROUGH THE LEVERS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY  WHILE CULTURAL ISSUES SEEM MORE RESISTANT TO CHANGE  PERHAPS IT IS BECAUSE PEOPLES ECONOMIC TROUBLES ARE OFTEN SAID TO REFLECT LARGER  STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS BEYOND THEIR CONTROL  WHEREAS THEIR CULTURAL DEFICIENCIES ARE SOMETIMES SEEN AS THEIR OWN FAULT  WHEN ACADEMICS AND JOURNALISTS WANT TO EXPRESS AFFINITY WITH THE WORKING CLASS  IN OTHER WORDS  THEY FOCUS ON POVERTY  AND WHEN THEY DONT  THEY FOCUS ON PREJUDICE CONTROVERSY OVER ECONOMIC VERSUS CULTURAL EXPLANATIONS OF POVERTY CAN BE TRACED TO 1966  WHEN THE ANTHROPOLOGIST OSCAR LEWIS  IN HIS BOOK LA VIDA  ON PUERTO RICANS IN NEW YORK  WROTE OF A CULTURE OF POVERTY THAT SEEMED IMPERVIOUS TO CHANGE TODAY  HOWEVER  ASTUTE SCHOLARS DO NOT SEE A WALL BETWEEN ECONOMICS AND CULTURE  THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FINANCIAL HARDSHIP AFFECTS THE DAILY LIVES OF WORKING CLASS AMERICANS  BUT THEY ADD THAT HOW THEY RESPOND IS BASED ON CULTURAL BELIEFS THAT MAY LEAD THEM TO SCAPEGOAT MINORITY GROUPS PEOPLE WITH UNSTABLE OR INSUFFICIENT INCOMES MAY EXPRESS THEIR FEARS BY TALKING ABOUT RACE BECAUSE THAT IS THE WAY THEY HAVE LEARNED TO INTERPRET THE WORLD  PEOPLE WHO ARE FRUSTRATED BY THEIR LACK OF PROGRESS MAY STILL TRY TO DEFEND THE DIGNITY OF THEIR WORK  IT IS A MISTAKE TO SEE ECONOMICS AND CULTURE AS DISTINCT FORCES  BOTH PROPELLED MR  TRUMP TO VICTORY

20180501,politics,trump,4,FROM THE MOMENT T MOBILE AND SPRINT ANNOUNCED THEIR  5 BILLION MERGER ON SUNDAY  THE WIRELESS CARRIERS HAVE POSITIONED THEIR PROPOSED DEAL WITH AN EYE TOWARD WASHINGTON  AFTER ALL  REGULATORS IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION BLOCKED ONE OF THEIR PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO COMBINE THIS TIME AROUND  THE CHIEF EXECUTIVES OF THE COMPANIES EMPHASIZED THAT MERGING WOULD HELP THEM TO  BUILD A NEXT GENERATION WIRELESS NETWORK  ONE ROBUST ENOUGH TO KEEP UP WITH CHINA IN A GROWING TECHNOLOGICAL ARMS RACE  CREATE THOUSANDS OF JOBS  ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS  KEEP PRICES LOW FOR CONSUMERS  ESPECIALLY AS CABLE COMPANIES LIKE COMCAST TRY TO ENTER THE MARKET NOT EVERYONE IS CONVINCED THEYLL DO EVERYTHING  THE HEADS OF BOTH COMPANIES BEGAN A CHARM OFFENSIVE IN WASHINGTON ON TUESDAY  HERES WHAT THREE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WILL WEIGH AS THEY CONSIDER THE BID CFIUS  IS THE DEAL IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES IN A REGULATORY FILING ON MONDAY  THE COMPANIES ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEY WOULD NEED APPROVAL FROM THE COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES  OR CFIUS  IT IS AN INTRA AGENCY PANEL RUN FROM THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT THAT REVIEWS MERGERS AND CAN BLOCK THEM ON NATIONAL SECURITY GROUNDS THE REASON FOR TWO AMERICAN CARRIERS TO NEED APPROVAL  T MOBILE  WHICH IS ACQUIRING SPRINT  IS CONTROLLED BY DEUTSCHE TELEKOM OF GERMANY  SPRINT IS MOSTLY OWNED BY SOFTBANK OF JAPAN DEUTSCHE TELEKOM AND SOFTBANK HAD TO UNDERGO REVIEWS BY CFIUS WHEN THEY BOUGHT CONTROL OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AMERICAN WIRELESS PROVIDERS YEARS AGO  WHICH SUGGESTS THAT ANY TRANSFER OF ASSETS BETWEEN THE TWO NOW WOULD PASS MUSTER BUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS RECENTLY TAKEN A HARDER STANCE ON FOREIGN OWNED ACQUISITIONS  IT PRE EMPTIVELY BLOCKED BROADCOMS HOSTILE BID FOR THE CHIP MAKER QUALCOMM  WHILE BROADCOM IS BASED IN SINGAPORE  AND HAD ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD RELOCATE TO THE UNITED STATES  THE LOGIC WAS THAT ANY CHANGE AT QUALCOMM COULD HAMPER ITS ABILITY TO HELP BUILD OUT THE NEXT GENERATION WIRELESS NETWORK  KNOWN AS 5G  IN THE UNITED STATES  THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO SAID IT MIGHT CONSIDER NATIONALIZING THE 5G NETWORK  UNDERSCORING THE SENSITIVITY OF THE TECHNOLOGY THAT UNDERLIES A MERGER BETWEEN SPRINT AND T MOBILE COMPLICATING MATTERS ARE THE BUSINESS DEALINGS OF SPRINTS OWNER  SOFTBANK  IT HAS TIES TO HUAWEI AND ZTE  TWO CHINESE TECH COMPANIES WHOSE CONNECTIONS TO BEIJING HAVE BEEN A MATTER OF CONTROVERSY BUT SPRINT AND T MOBILE ARE LIKELY TO POINT OUT THAT EACH HAS ALREADY PASSED A CFIUS REVIEW IN THE PAST  AND ARE WILLING TO MAKE CONCESSIONS TO WIN OVER THE PANEL NOW F C C  WHATS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION HAS SCRUTINIZED A POSSIBLE T MOBILE SPRINT MERGER BEFORE IN 2014  SOFTBANKS FOUNDER  MASAYOSHI SON  MET WITH THE CHAIRMAN OF THE F C C  AT THE TIME  TOM WHEELER  AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS ANTITRUST CHIEF AT THE TIME  BILL BAER  MR  SONS GOAL  TO CONVINCE THE REGULATORS THAT AT T AND VERIZON WERE AN OLIGOPOLY THAT HAD A STRANGLEHOLD ON THE UNITED STATES WIRELESS MARKET  THE BEST WAY TO COMBAT THAT  MR  SON ARGUED  WAS BY LETTING SPRINT COMBINE WITH T MOBILE MR  WHEELER AND MR  BAER REJECTED THE ARGUMENT  CONCLUDING THAT EFFECTIVELY REDUCING THE WIRELESS MARKET TO THREE MAJOR CARRIERS FROM FOUR WOULD NOT BE GOOD FOR CONSUMERS  THE MERGER MADE NO SENSE BEFORE  AND IT MAKES NO SENSE TODAY  THE TWO WROTE IN AN OP ED ON CNBC COM LAST YEAR  AS T MOBILE AND SPRINT RESUMED MERGER TALKS SPRINT AND T MOBILE ARE NOW BETTING THAT THE NEW F C C  CHAIRMAN  AJIT PAI  FEELS DIFFERENTLY A TRUMP APPOINTEE  MR  PAI HAS SAID THAT HE WOULD EMPLOY HUMILITY IN DETERMINING WHICH MERGERS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO GO THROUGH  LAST YEAR  HE PUSHED THE F C C  TO RELAX RULES LIMITING HOW MANY TELEVISION STATIONS A BROADCASTER COULD OWN  WEEKS LATER  THE SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP UNVEILED A DEAL TO BUY TRIBUNE  A TRANSACTION THAT  IF COMPLETED  WOULD MAKE THE COMPANY THE MOST POWERFUL TELEVISION STATION OWNER IN THE COUNTRY   THE F C C S INTERNAL WATCHDOG HAS BEGUN AN INQUIRY INTO THAT DEREGULATORY PUSH AND WHETHER IT HAD BEEN TIMED TO HELP SINCLAIR ONE QUESTION IS HOW THE F C C  WILL REGARD SPRINT AND T MOBILES ARGUMENT THAT THEY NEED TO FEND OFF NEW PLAYERS IN THE MARKET  THE CARRIERS HAVE POINTED OUT THAT COMCAST HAS BEGUN BUNDLING WIRELESS SERVICE WITH CABLE TELEVISION OFFERINGS  ESSENTIALLY BY RESELLING ACCESS TO VERIZONS NETWORK  CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS IS EXPECTED TO UNVEIL A SIMILAR SERVICE AS WELL CRAIG MOFFETT  AN ANALYST AT THE RESEARCH FIRM MOFFETTNATHANSON  SAID THAT THE COMMISSION HAS NOT TRADITIONALLY CONSIDERED OFFERINGS FROM CABLE COMPANIES WHEN IT COMES TO ANALYZING CONCENTRATION IN THE WIRELESS MARKET  WHETHER IT WILL NOW IS UNCLEAR JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  WILL PEOPLE PAY HIGHER PRICES THE BIGGEST REGULATORY WILD CARDS MAY BE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND ITS CURRENT ANTITRUST CHIEF  MAKAN DELRAHIM  LATE LAST YEAR  THE TRUMP APPOINTEE SUED TO BLOCK AT TS  4 BILLION TAKEOVER OF TIME WARNER  ARGUING THAT THE COMBINATION WOULD LEAD TO HIGHER PRICES FOR CONTENT FROM HBO AND TURNER BROADCASTING CHANNELS THE MOVE WAS NOTABLE BECAUSE AT TS DEAL INVOLVED BUYING A CONTENT COMPANY  NOT ANOTHER TELECOMMUNICATIONS RIVAL T MOBILE AND SPRINTS DEAL WOULD UNITE TWO DIRECT COMPETITORS  A TYPE OF DEAL THAT REGULATORS HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN HARDER ON MR  DELRAHIM HAS ALSO OPENED AN INVESTIGATION INTO WHETHER AT T  VERIZON AND POTENTIALLY OTHER CARRIERS HAVE COLLUDED TO HAMSTRING AN EFFORT TO HELP CONSUMERS SWITCH WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS MORE EASILY AND IT WAS THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT FIRST MOVED TO BLOCK AT TS 2011 BID FOR T MOBILE  IN ITS LAWSUIT  THE DEPARTMENT ARGUED THAT SHRINKING FROM FOUR CARRIERS TO THREE WOULD REMOVE A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE FORCE FROM THE MARKET  THAT ATTITUDE PREVAILED AGAIN IN 2014 WHEN MR  BAER PUSHED BACK AGAINST A UNION OF T MOBILE AND SPRINT MANY OF THE DEPARTMENTS ANTITRUST STAFF MEMBERS TODAY ARE HOLDOVERS FROM 2014  SUGGESTING THEY MAY TAKE SIMILAR STANCES NOW AS THEY DID THEN THOUGH CORPORATE AMERICA ASSUMED THAT A TRUMP PRESIDENCY WOULD BE MORE LENIENT TOWARD DEAL MAKING  IT HAS MAINTAINED AN AGGRESSIVENESS IN REGULATING MERGERS  ACCORDING TO NORMAN ARMSTRONG JR  THE CO HEAD OF THE ANTITRUST PRACTICE AT THE LAW FIRM KING   SPALDING OVERALL I HAVENT SEEN MUCH CHANGE FROM THE LAST ADMINISTRATION TO THIS ONE  HE SAID

20180506,business,business,5,LAS VEGAS  MOCKING CARROT TOP IS A VENERABLE COMEDY TRADITION SOUTH PARK AND NORM MACDONALD WERE MERCILESS  BUT BILL HICKS GOT THERE FIRST  BURYING THE REDHEADED COMIC CONCISELY  CARROT TOP  FOR PEOPLE WHO DIDNT GET GALLAGHER IN A RECENT EPISODE OF CONAN  JIM GAFFIGAN PUZZLED OVER WHY THE POPULAR COMIC INSPIRES SUCH SCORN  I DONT KNOW  HE SAID  IN A TONE THAT SUGGESTED HE WAS SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS  PROPS IN COMEDY CIRCLES  PROPS GET FEW PROPS  EXCEPT THAT IS  FROM AUDIENCES  STEVE MARTIN  AFTER ALL  WAS A PROP COMIC  ALTHOUGH HES TOO RESPECTED FOR ANYONE TO CALL HIM THAT  AT THE HEIGHT OF MR  MARTINS STAND UP FAME  ONE OF THE ONLY OTHER STAND UPS FILLING ARENAS WAS GALLAGHER  WHOSE ONSTAGE FRUIT SMASHING EARNED HIM 15 COMEDY SPECIALS  CARROT TOP WAS INFLUENCED BY GALLAGHER  BUT HAS ECLIPSED HIM TO BECOME THE MOST FAMOUS PROP COMIC ALIVE THESE DAYS  CARROT TOP  WHOSE REAL NAME IS SCOTT THOMPSON  RECEIVES LITTLE ATTENTION FROM CRITICS  TALK SHOW BOOKERS OR NETFLIX EXECUTIVES DESPITE HAVING WHAT IS SURELY THE LONGEST RUNNING STAND UP ACT IN THE COUNTRY  HE HAS PLAYED SOLD OUT HOUSES AT THE LUXOR HOTEL IN LAS VEGAS FOR 13 YEARS  COMPETING WITH CRISS ANGEL AND CIRQUE DU SOLEIL FOR LONGEVITY  ON A RECENT VISIT  I FOUND CARROT TOP  53  TO BE A FAR MORE AMBITIOUS PERFORMER THAN HE GETS CREDIT FOR  AN INNOVATOR IN THE SHAMELESS PURSUIT OF CHEAP  SOMETIMES QUESTIONABLE  LAUGHS HE HAS HEARD THE RIDICULE AND DONE THE SAVVY THING BY WORKING IT INTO HIS ACT  HE SHOWS CLIPS FROM SHOWS TEASING HIM  BUT ALSO PROJECTS A SELF DEPRECATING PERSONA  CALLING HIS OWN BITS STUPID AND POKING FUN AT HIS OWN APPEARANCE  SEVERAL YEARS AGO  CARROT TOP STARTED BULKING UP  AND WHILE HE HAS LOST SOME OF THAT MUSCLE  HE STILL HAS A THICK NECK AND SHARP  SMOOTH FACIAL FEATURES  IN A 2015 ESQUIRE PROFILE  HE SAID HE GETS BOTOX AND TINTS HIS EYEBROWS  AND ONSTAGE  HE WEARS INSECURITY ABOUT HIS APPEARANCE LIGHTLY  CONFESSING THAT SOME OF THE CURLS HES KNOWN FOR ARE GOING WHITE  I AM GOING TO BE COTTON TOP NEXT TIME  HE SAYS HIS INSULTS ABOUT THE REST OF HIS APPEARANCE GO HARDER  POINTING AT HIS FACE  HE SAYS WITH A GRIMACE  THANK YOU FOR LOOKING AT THIS  THEN HE WAITS A BEAT  LOOKING SLIGHTLY UNCOMFORTABLE LISTENING TO THE LAUGHTER  IN THIS MOMENT  YOU CAN SEE CARROT TOP MORPHING INTO SCOTT THOMPSON  BEFORE HE RETURNS TO THE NEXT JOKE WHATS EVEN MORE STRIKING THAN THIS ABRUPT VULNERABILITY IS HOW LITTLE PROP COMEDY HE LEANS ON  HE OPENS AND CLOSES WITH IT  BUT THATS ABOUT IT  IMAGINE GOING TO SEE LARRY THE CABLE GUY AND ONLY HEARING HIM SAY GIT R DONE TWICE  MOVING SLOWER THAN HE USED TO  CARROT TOP DOES STRAIGHT STAND UP  MUCH OF IT FOCUSED ON LOCAL CONCERNS  BE CAREFUL GAMBLING  HE SAYS  I GOT DRUNK AND SPENT  ON A COKE MACHINE  THERES ALSO A SERIES OF HUSTLING IMITATIONS OF AGING ROCK STARS  MICK JAGGER  STEVEN TYLER  BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF JOKES FROM THE SHOW ARE NOT VISUAL BUT AURAL IVE NEVER SEEN A STAND UP SHOW WITH A MORE ELABORATE SOUND DESIGN  HARDLY A FEW SECONDS GO BY WITHOUT A BIT PUNCTUATED BY A CLIP FROM A POPULAR SONG OR A CARTOONISH SQUAWK OR SOME OTHER AUDIO ACCENT  ITS STAND UP SCORED LIKE A MUSICAL  TRICKED OUT WITH SMOKE AND WIND MACHINES AND CONFETTI BLASTS  NOT TO MENTION DRAMATIC SHIFTS IN LIGHTING  ARE THESE MEANT TO SERVE AS EASY SHORTCUTS TO LAUGHS  OFTEN  YES  BUT PRECISION MATTERS AS MUCH WITH DESIGN AS IT DOES WITH PUNCH LINES  AND THE TIMING OF THIS PRODUCTION IS NEVER OFF THE BIGGEST LAUGHS COME WHEN THE VISUALS  SOUND AND PROPS ALL WORK TOGETHER  AS WHEN THE STAGE WENT DARK  AND HE WALKED AROUND WITH A FLASHLIGHT WHILE THE U2 SONG I STILL HAVENT FOUND WHAT IM LOOKING FOR PLAYED CARROT TOPS PROPS ARE STILL QUAINTLY HOMEMADE  A CLUMSY JUXTAPOSITION TO THE REST OF THE SHOW  ITS AS IF A VIDEO GAME WERE INTERRUPTED BY AN ARTS AND CRAFTS DEMONSTRATION  STANDING IN FRONT OF A COLLECTION OF TRUNKS  HE GRABS SIGHT GAGS LIKE A NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS HELMET THAT DOUBLES AS A KLEENEX DISPENSER OR GOOFY OBJECTS LIKE CROC SHOES PASTED TO TOY CROCODILES  THESE REQUIRE NO EXPLANATION  BUT SERVE AS VISUAL PUNCH LINES TO QUICK SETUPS  HE ANNOUNCES AMISH BLOW DRYER  FOR EXAMPLE  THEN GRABS A TUBE AND BLOWS ON ONE END NONE OF THESE ARE ESPECIALLY FUNNY ON THEIR OWN  BUT HE PICKS THEM UP AND DISPENSES WITH THEM SO QUICKLY THAT THEY DO TAKE ON A DIVERTING MOMENTUM  PUTTING AN EMPHASIS ON SPEED OVER QUALITY  CARROT TOP OVERPOWERS HIS AUDIENCE WITH A FLURRY OF JOKES  NEVER PAUSING FOR MORE THAN A FEW SECONDS BEFORE THE NEXT ONE ARRIVES THIS SHOW IS DOPEY AND OCCASIONALLY OFFENSIVE  THERE ARE LAME SEXUAL JOKES ABOUT ELTON JOHN  ELLEN DEGENERES AND RICKY MARTIN AS IF THE FACT OF THEIR HOMOSEXUALITY IS ITSELF FUNNY  IF YOU WANTED TO DO A DEEP DIVE INTO THE POLITICS OF CARROT TOP  THERES PLENTY TO WORK WITH  AFTER ALL  HE IS AN ORANGE HAIRED BUFFOON WHO BECAME FAMOUS IN THE 1980S AND REMAINS POPULAR DESPITE BEING SNEERED AT BY THE ELITE MEDIA BUT CARROT TOP MOSTLY AVOIDS POLITICS  SAYING NO MORE AFTER ONE TRUMP JOKE  IF THE CONTENT OF HIS JOKES SEEMS DATED  THE FORM IS AHEAD OF ITS TIME  MORE IN TUNE WITH THE KINETIC TIM AND ERIC STYLE OF VIDEOS THAN WHAT YOU FIND IN A CLUB  STAND UP CAN BE TRADITION BOUND  AND CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF IT HAVE LONG FETISHIZED STATIONARY COMICS TALKING INTO A MICROPHONE  THIS SIMPLICITY CAN BE A STRENGTH  KEEPING THE FOCUS ON LANGUAGE IN A DIGITAL AGE WHEN WORDS ARE OFTEN OVERSHADOWED BY IMAGE  BUT CAN ALSO BE LIMITING CERTAIN COMICS WITH UNORTHODOX ARTISTIC CAREERS LIKE BO BURNHAM EXPANDED THE RANGE OF WHAT STAND UP CAN DO  CARROT TOP IS A LESS SOPHISTICATED AND MORE RUTHLESSLY COMMERCIALLY ARTIST  BUT HE SHARES SOME OF THE SAME EXPERIMENTAL SPIRIT  IN STAYING IN HIS OWN THEATER FOR SO MANY YEARS  HE HAS HAD TIME TO BUILD UP HIS SHOW AND REFINE IT BY THE TIME HE STARTS PASSING OUT DRINKS  ITS CLEAR HE WILL DO ANYTHING TO PLEASE THE CROWD  WHICH DOES APPEAR TO BE HAVING A GREAT TIME  HIS COMEDY PANDERS SHAMELESSLY  BUT HE IS HARDLY THE FIRST ENTERTAINER IN LAS VEGAS TO COMMIT THIS SIN THE FACT IS THAT CARROT TOP HAS FIGURED OUT SOMETHING ESSENTIAL ABOUT SURVIVING IN SHOW BUSINESS  TO SUSTAIN A LONG CAREER  YOUVE GOT TO HAVE MORE THAN A GIMMICK  YOU NEED AT LEAST TWO OR THREE
20180504,politics,trump,5,WASHINGTON  PRESIDENT TRUMP UNDERCUT HIS ATTORNEY RUDOLPH W  GIULIANI ON FRIDAY  AND SAID THE FORMER NEW YORK MAYOR WILL EVENTUALLY GET THE FACTS RIGHT REGARDING A PAYMENT TO

CONFUSION ABOUT THE PAYMENT WITH AN INTERVIEW ON FOX NEWS ON WEDNESDAY  SURPRISING EVEN SOME OF MR  TRUMPS OTHER ATTORNEYS IN A SERIES OF TWITTER POSTS THE FOLLOWING MORNING  THE PRESIDENT BACKED UP

TO MAKE COMMENTS THE PRESIDENT ALSO ADDRESSED THE ONGOING SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION  LED BY ROBERT S  MUELLER III  AND SAID HE WOULD BE HAPPY TO SIT DOWN AND ANSWER MR  MUELLERS QUESTIONS  BUT HE SAID THAT THE INVESTIGATION IS A WITCH HUNT BEING RUN BY DEMOCRATS  AND HIS LAWYERS WILL NOT LET HIM I WOULD LOVE TO SPEAK  I WOULD LOVE TO  NOBODY WANTS TO SPEAK MORE THAN ME  MR  TRUMP SAID  BUT THE

20180502,politics,trump,5,WASHINGTON  PRESIDENT TRUMP PLUNGED INTO AN ANGRY DISPUTE ON WEDNESDAY BETWEEN CONSERVATIVE HOUSE REPUBLICANS AND THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL  SIDING WITH HARD LINE LAWMAKERS OVER HIS OWN JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AS THEY PRESSED FOR ACCESS TO SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE SPECIAL COUNSELS INVESTIGATION AND OTHER POLITICALLY CHARGED CASES IN A TWITTER POST  MR  TRUMP CALLED THE LEGAL SYSTEM RIGGED AND AMPLIFIED THE LAWMAKERS COMPLAINTS THAT THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL  ROD J  ROSENSTEIN  WAS NOT MOVING FAST ENOUGH TO TURN OVER THE DOCUMENTS THEY WANT  THE PRESIDENT STEPPED IN JUST AS MR  ROSENSTEIN APPEARED TO MOLLIFY THREE KEY COMMITTEE CHAIRMEN WHO WERE ALSO DEMANDING INTERNAL DOCUMENTS THEY DONT WANT TO TURN OVER DOCUMENTS TO CONGRESS  WHAT ARE THEY AFRAID OF  WHY SO MUCH REDACTING  WHY SUCH UNEQUAL JUSTICE  MR  TRUMP WROTE  AT SOME POINT I WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO USE THE POWERS GRANTED TO THE PRESIDENCY AND GET INVOLVED  WHICH PRESIDENTIAL POWERS MR  TRUMP WAS REFERRING TO WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY CLEAR DISTRUST BETWEEN MR  ROSENSTEIN AND CONGRESS HAS BEEN BUILDING OVER MONTHS  IN RECENT WEEKS  HE HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT GESTURES TO RELEASE DOCUMENTS DEMANDED BY PROMINENT CONGRESSMEN  ONLY TO BE THREATENED WITH IMPEACHMENT BY LAWMAKERS FROM THE FAR RIGHT MR  ROSENSTEIN RESPONDED ON TUESDAY TO THAT THREAT BY DECLARING THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WOULD NOT BE EXTORTED OFFICIALS AT THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVE THAT THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE NOW GONE TOO FAR WITH DOCUMENT REQUESTS RELATED TO CONTINUING INVESTIGATIONS THAT THE LAWMAKERS CLEARLY DO NOT SUPPORT  INCLUDING THE INQUIRY LED BY THE SPECIAL COUNSEL  ROBERT S  MUELLER III  INTO RUSSIAS ELECTION INTERFERENCE  A FORMER FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL FAMILIAR WITH THE DEPARTMENTS VIEWS SAID THAT MR  ROSENSTEIN AND TOP F B I  OFFICIALS HAVE COME TO SUSPECT THAT SOME LAWMAKERS WERE USING THEIR OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY TO GAIN INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THAT INVESTIGATION SO THAT IT COULD BE SHARED WITH THE WHITE HOUSE MR  TRUMPS THREAT ON WEDNESDAY TO INTERVENE BOLSTERED THOSE VOICES AND COULD UNDERMINE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS ABILITY TO PROTECT SOME OF ITS MOST CLOSELY HELD SECRETS  LAWMAKERS CONDUCTING OVERSIGHT ARE USUALLY GIVEN SUMMARIES OF THE INFORMATION  BUT NOT THE INTELLIGENCE COLLECTED DIRECTLY FROM WIRETAPS AND SENSITIVE SOURCES SIMILAR STANDOFFS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AND CONGRESS HAVE RESULTED IN COMPROMISE DATING BACK DECADES  BUT IN THOSE CASES  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAD THE SUPPORT OF THE PRESIDENT  WITHOUT MR  TRUMPS SUPPORT  CONGRESS IS GAINING THE ADVANTAGE REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS  FOR THEIR PART  ARGUE THAT MR  ROSENSTEINS DEPARTMENT HAS SLOW WALKED IMPORTANT REQUESTS AND WITHHELD CRUCIAL DETAILS FROM DOCUMENTS THEY DO TURN OVER  MATERIAL THEY SAY IS NECESSARY TO DOING THEIR JOBS  AND THEIR THREATS ARE HARDLY VEILED DESPITE HIS REPEATED PROMISES TO COOPERATE  MR  ROSENSTEINS SUPERVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS BEEN SORELY INADEQUATE  SAID REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS  REPUBLICAN OF NORTH CAROLINA AND ONE OF MR  ROSENSTEINS MOST OUTSPOKEN ANTAGONISTS  VALID INVESTIGATIVE REQUESTS FROM CONGRESS HAVE BEEN SLOW WALKED  STONEWALLED AND IMPEDED AT EACH STEP OF THE WAY UNDER HIS WATCH HE ADDED  IF MR  ROSENSTEINS HESITANCE TO PRODUCE DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION TO CONGRESS REPRESENTED AN EFFORT TO SAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FROM EMBARRASSMENT  IT IS TOO LATE MR  ROSENSTEIN  AWARE OF THE THREATS AGAINST HIM  HAS TAKEN UNUSUAL STEPS TO TRY TO MEET THE DEMANDS  ADDING EMPLOYEES TO REVIEW THE REQUESTED FILES AND SHARING UNREDACTED DOCUMENTS NORMALLY OFF LIMITS TO CONGRESS  INCLUDING MEMOS DRAFTED BY THE FORMER F B I  DIRECTOR JAMES B  COMEY ABOUT HIS INTERACTIONS WITH MR  TRUMP  THE DEPARTMENT HAS EVEN SET UP OFFICE SPACE AT ITS HEADQUARTERS FOR CONGRESSIONAL STAFF MEMBERS AND LAWMAKERS TO REVIEW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS ALREADY STUDIED BY THE DEPARTMENTS INSPECTOR GENERAL  ACCORDING TO A DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THOSE EFFORTS HAVE PLACATED POWERFUL REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE CHAIRMEN AFTER REPRESENTATIVE DEVIN NUNES OF CALIFORNIA  THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE  THREATENED LAST MONTH TO HOLD MR  ROSENSTEIN IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS OR PROCEED WITH IMPEACHMENT  MR  ROSENSTEIN GAVE HIM ACCESS TO AN ALMOST COMPLETELY UNREDACTED F B I  MEMO ON THE OPENING OF THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION AND WON HIS THANKS HE REACHED AN AGREEMENT LAST WEEK WITH THE TWO REPUBLICANS WHO RUN THE COMMITTEES THAT CONDUCT OVERSIGHT OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  REPRESENTATIVES ROBERT W  GOODLATTE OF VIRGINIA AND TREY GOWDY OF SOUTH CAROLINA  TO SATISFY THE LAST OF THEIR DEMANDS FOR DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE INVESTIGATION INTO HILLARY CLINTONS EMAILS AND OTHER DECISIONS RELATED TO THE RUSSIA CASE BUT THOSE COMPROMISES MAY HAVE ONLY EMBOLDENED MR  TRUMPS FIERCEST ALLIES  INCLUDING MR  MEADOWS  THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HARD LINE HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS  AND REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN OF OHIO  A FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE CAUCUS  IN AN UNUSUAL SHOW OF DEFIANCE  BOTH MEN HAVE INSISTED THAT THE AGREEMENT WITH THE CHAIRMEN OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY AND HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH AND THAT THEY NEED ACCESS TO AN UNREDACTED VERSION OF AN AUGUST 2017 MEMO OUTLINING THE SCOPE OF MR  MUELLERS INVESTIGATION DEMOCRATS FEAR THAT THE REPUBLICAN REQUESTS  MANY OF WHICH CALL ON THE DEPARTMENT TO IGNORE LONGSTANDING POLICY ABOUT WHAT IT SHARES WITH CONGRESS  ARE MEANT AS A TRAP  EITHER MR  ROSENSTEIN CAN TURN OVER INFORMATION THAT COULD BE USED TO UNDERMINE THE SPECIAL COUNSELS INQUIRY  OR HE COULD REFUSE  GIVING MR  TRUMP COVER  OR EVEN CAUSE  TO FIRE THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL REPRESENTATIVE JERROLD NADLER OF NEW YORK  THE TOP DEMOCRAT ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE  SAID THE LATEST REPUBLICAN EFFORTS WERE CLEARLY TRYING TO SABOTAGE MR  MUELLERS INVESTIGATION AND COURT A CONFRONTATION WITH MR  ROSENSTEIN ALL OF THIS NOISE IS AIMED AT UNDERMINING THE SPECIAL COUNSELS WORK AS THE INVESTIGATION CLOSES IN ON THE PRESIDENT  MR  NADLER SAID IN A STATEMENT  THE PRESIDENTS ATTACKS ON THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE GROW MORE PARANOID BY THE DAY  THE CASE FOR OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE  AND THE COMPLICITY OF THESE HOUSE REPUBLICANS  GROWS DAY BY DAY AS WELL MR  ROSENSTEIN  WHO HAS ALREADY GIVEN THE REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS ACCESS TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS  HAS MADE CLEAR IN RECENT DAYS THAT HE DOES NOT INTEND TO GO FURTHER ON MONDAY  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WROTE TO MR  MEADOWS AND MR  JORDAN TO DENY THEM ACCESS TO THE DOCUMENT ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THE RUSSIA INQUIRY  CITING DEPARTMENT POLICY AGAINST SHARING INFORMATION ON A CONTINUING INVESTIGATION THE DEPARTMENT RECOGNIZES THE KEEN INTEREST THAT CONGRESS HAS IN THE SPECIAL COUNSELS INVESTIGATION  BUT  RESPECTFULLY  WE MUST ADHERE TO THE LONGSTANDING POSITION OF THE DEPARTMENT THAT CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRIES PERTAINING TO ONGOING CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS THREATEN THE INTEGRITY OF THOSE INVESTIGATIONS  STEPHEN E  BOYD  AN ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL  WROTE IN THE LETTER  A COPY OF WHICH WAS PROVIDED TO THE NEW YORK TIMES WE HOPE YOU CAN RESPECT OUR POSITION  HE ADDED AND ON TUESDAY  MR  ROSENSTEIN  REACTING TO REPORTS THAT MR  MEADOWS HAD DRAFTED ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT TO USE AGAINST HIM IF NEEDED  PUSHED BACK HARD IF WE WERE TO JUST OPEN OUR DOORS TO ALLOW CONGRESS TO COME AND RUMMAGE THROUGH THE FILES  THAT WOULD BE A SERIOUS INFRINGEMENT ON THE SEPARATION OF POWERS  MR  ROSENSTEIN SAID AT AN EVENT IN WASHINGTON  IT MIGHT RESOLVE A DISPUTE TODAY  BUT IT WOULD HAVE NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS IN THE LONG RUN  AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DEFEND THE INSTITUTION IT IS UNUSUAL FOR RANK AND FILE MEMBERS OF A COMMITTEE TO CHALLENGE OR MANEUVER AROUND THEIR OWN CHAIRMEN ON SENSITIVE MATTERS  BUT MR  JORDAN AND MR  MEADOWS ARE KNOWN AS TWO OF THE MOST CONFRONTATIONAL REPUBLICANS IN THE CHAMBER  MR  MEADOWS HAS DEVELOPED A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH MR  TRUMP  WHILE CONSERVATIVES ARE TALKING UP MR  JORDAN AS A CANDIDATE TO SUCCEED REPRESENTATIVE PAUL D  RYAN AS SPEAKER NEITHER LAWMAKER RESPONDED ON WEDNESDAY TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT IN AN APPARENT BREAK WITH BOTH MEN  MR  GOWDY  CHAIRMAN OF THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE  SAID ON WEDNESDAY THAT HE WAS SATISFIED THAT HIS COMMITTEE AND THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE NOW HAD THE ACCESS IT NEEDED TO DOCUMENTS RELEVANT TO A CONTINUING JOINT INVESTIGATION INTO DECISIONS MADE BY THE DEPARTMENT IN 2016 AND 2017 I APPRECIATE ROSENSTEINS WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEES  AND I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN HIS LEADERSHIP  MR  GOWDY SAID  ADDING THAT MR  MUELLER SHOULD BE GIVEN THE TIME  THE INDEPENDENCE AND THE RESOURCES TO CONDUCT A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION MR  TRUMP  WHO HAS PRIVATELY FUMED ABOUT MR  ROSENSTEIN  HAS SAID PUBLICLY THAT THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL FACED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST  THE PRESIDENT CRITICIZED MR  ROSENSTEIN FOR SIGNING A SEARCH WARRANT APPLICATION TO PERMIT FEDERAL AGENTS TO EAVESDROP ON ONE OF MR  TRUMPS FORMER CAMPAIGN AIDES MR  ROSENSTEIN ASSUMED OVERSIGHT OF THE INVESTIGATION AND APPOINTED MR  MUELLER AS SPECIAL COUNSEL AFTER THE ATTORNEY GENERAL  JEFF SESSIONS  RECUSED HIMSELF LAST YEAR  MR  TRUMP HAS REPEATEDLY ATTACKED MR  SESSIONS FOR HIS RECUSAL THE PRESIDENTS WARNING ON WEDNESDAY WAS A SHARP DEPARTURE FROM EARLIER COMMENTS  WHEN HE HAS SAID THAT ALTHOUGH HE IS FRUSTRATED WITH THE INVESTIGATION INTO HIS CAMPAIGN  HE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE INVOLVED WITH DEPARTMENT MATTERS I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO BE INVOLVED WITH THE F B I  MR  TRUMP SAID IN AN INTERVIEW IN NOVEMBER  IM NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THE KIND OF THINGS THAT I WOULD LOVE TO BE DOING  AND IM VERY FRUSTRATED BY IT BUT MR  TRUMP IS INCREASINGLY ON THE DEFENSIVE  AFTER AN F B I  RAID OF THE OFFICE AND HOTEL ROOM OF HIS PERSONAL LAWYER  MICHAEL D  COHEN  AND THE DISCLOSURE OF MORE THAN 40 QUESTIONS THAT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL WOULD LIKE HIM TO ANSWER  THE QUESTIONS TOUCH ON A VARIETY OF TOPICS  INCLUDING COORDINATION WITH THE RUSSIANS DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AND ACTIONS THAT MR  TRUMP HAS TAKEN AS PRESIDENT AND WHETHER THEY WERE INTENDED TO DERAIL THE INQUIRY

DISMISSED OR FOUND THE TRUMP LAWYERS ARGUMENTS TO BE UNPERSUASIVE AND GRANTED SUMMARY JUDGMENT TO THE CONDOMINIUMS BOARD THE RULING CAME IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST IN JANUARY BY THE BOARD  ASKING THE JUDGE TO DECLARE THAT A LICENSING AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE BUILDING AND DJT HOLDINGS  ONE OF MR  TRUMPS COMPANIES  THAT GAVE THE CONDO THE RIGHT TO USE THE TRUMP NAME ON ITS FACADE  DID NOT REQUIRE IT TO USE THE NAME AFTER MR  TRUMP WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT IN 2016  A STRAW POLL OF BUILDING RESIDENTS FOUND THAT TWO THIRDS OF THE 253 CONDO OWNERS WHO PARTICIPATED WANTED TO REMOVE THE NAME  WHILE 23

MADE ANY EFFORT TO REMOVE THE TRUMP LETTERING  MR  TRUMP WOULD COMMENCE APPROPRIATE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS TO NOT ONLY PREVENT SUCH UNAUTHORIZED ACTION  BUT TO ALSO RECOVER THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DAMAGES  COSTS AND ATTORNEYS FEES THAT WAS NO SMALL MATTER IN THE MINDS OF MANY CONDO OWNERS  MR  TRUMP HAS A REPUTATION AS A VIGOROUS IF NOT ALWAYS VICTORIOUS PLAINTIFF AND DEFENDANT WHOSE

ABOUT BEING ENSNARED IN COSTLY AND LENGTHY LITIGATION  I WOULD RATHER THE BUILDING SPEND MONEY ON A LONG GESTATING RENOVATION PROJECT THAN THIS LITIGATION  SAID THE LONGTIME RESIDENT WHO ASKED FOR ANONYMITY BECAUSE FEELINGS ARE RUNNING HOT IN THE BUILDING THE MARCH 2000 LICENSING AGREEMENT WAS MADE IN THE EARLY DAYS OF MR  TRUMPS EFFORT TO ESTABLISH THE TRUMP BRAND THE AGREEMENT IDENTIFIED MR  TRUMP IN THE FIRST SENTENCE AS A WORLDWIDE RENOWNED BUILDER AND DEVELOPER OF REAL ESTATE WHO ENJOYS THE HIGHEST REPUTATION IN THESE FIELDS AMONG OTHERS  AND IT GRANTED THE CONDOMINIUM OWNERS THE CONTINUED USE OF THE TRUMP NAME FOR   FOREVER THE TRUMP LAWYERS HAVE ARGUED IN COURT PAPERS THAT THE CONSIDERATION THAT FLOWED TO MR  TRUMP WAS NOT SIMPLY A SINGLE DOLLAR  BUT RATHER THE ASSURANCE THAT THE BUILDING WOULD BE NAMED TRUMP PLACE IN PERPETUITY JUDGE BRANSTEN  FOLLOWING IN THE PATH OF FEDERAL JUDGES WHO HAVE RECENTLY CONFOUNDED MR  TRUMP IN COURT ON IMMIGRATION ISSUES  FOUND THAT THE FOUR PAGE LICENSING AGREEMENT BETWEEN MR  TRUMP AND THE CONDOMINIUM GAVE THE CONDO PERMISSION TO USE THE TRUMP NAME BUT IN NO WAY REQUIRES THE OWNER TO USE IT  THEREFORE  NOTHING PREVENTS THE BOARD FROM TAKING IT OFF THE BUILDING THE BOARD PLANS TO CONDUCT A FORMAL VOTE OF OWNERS TO DECIDE THE MATTER  THE BOARD HAS ESTIMATED THAT IT WOULD COST ABOUT  000 TO REMOVE THE LETTERS AND ANOTHER  000 TO

CASH POURING INTO THE SECTOR IS ALSO ENCOURAGING SMALLER DEBT FUNDS TO LEVERAGE PORTFOLIOS TO MAINTAIN RETURNS  UP TO 50 BANKS ARE NOW COMPETING TO OFFER SUBSCRIPTION LINES OF UP TO 2BN TO SUPPORT MULTI BILLION DOLLAR PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS  BUT FUND FINANCING SPECIALISTS ARE ALSO SEEING RISING DEMAND FOR NET ASSET VALUE  NAV  LINES FROM SMALLER DEBT FUNDS  INCLUDING DIRECT LENDERS  CLOS AND REAL ESTATE FUNDS FUND FINANCING IS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING AREAS OF THE SYNDICATED LOAN MARKET AS IT SUPPORTS THE BOOMING INSTITUTIONAL BUYSIDE  TWO THIRDS OF MANAGERS NOW USE FUND LINES  ACCORDING TO A RECENT EVESTMENT REPORT BUT THE MARKET IS OPAQUE AND DEAL STRUCTURES ARE BECOMING MORE SOPHISTICATED AND COMPLEX AS MORE BANKS COMPETE AGGRESSIVELY FOR BUSINESS STRUCTURES HAVE CHANGED AND BECOME MORE COMPLEX AS BUSINESS HAVE GOT MORE COMPLEX  THIS GIVES BORROWERS SOME POWER  A BANKER SAID SUBSCRIPTION LINES MAKE UP AROUND 80  OF THE FUND FINANCING MARKET AND ARE TYPICALLY USED BY PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS TO COVER THE GAP BETWEEN CALLING FOR LP INVESTORS COMMITMENTS AND RECEIVING FUNDS  THEY ARE BASED ON INVESTORS CREDIT PROFILES AND DO NOT ADD LEVERAGE NET ASSET VALUE LINES ARE BASED ON THE VALUE OF ASSETS IN FUNDS PORTFOLIOS AND DO ADD LEVERAGE WHICH HELPS TO BOOST RETURNS  GENERAL PARTNERS  GP  LINES ARE SECURED AGAINST FUND MANAGEMENT FEES  HYBRID LINES  WHICH COMBINE SUBSCRIPTION LINES AND NAV LINES  ARE BEING HAILED AS THE FUTURE OF FUND FINANCING  BUT ARE GROWING SLOWLY AS THEY ARE COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT TO EXECUTE IN PRACTICE  THERES BEEN A LOT OF TALK OF HYBRID LINES  SAID

MARKET OBSERVERS ARE SANGUINE THESE ARE VERY DEEP WATERS  A LONDON BASED HEAD OF LEVERAGED FINANCE SAID  ALL SIGNED DEALS LOOK GOOD ON PAPER AND NO ONE GOES INTO THEM THINKING THEYLL LOSE MONEY  BUT THERE WILL BE A LOT OF PAIN AHEAD NO DEFAULTALTHOUGH THE FUND FINANCING MARKET HAS HAD NO DEFAULTS TO DATE ON SUBSCRIPTION LINES  THE GROWING SIZE OF DEALS AND MORE AGGRESSIVE TERMS ARE REQUIRING LENDERS TO READ THE FINE PRINT OF THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS MORE CAREFULLY  AND LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE  BANKS DEAL WITH FUND FINANCING IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS  WHICH CAN MAKE AGGREGATING EXPOSURE DIFFICULT  AND EVEN POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC IN A SEVERE DOWNTURN FUND FINANCING USUALLY SITS IN THE FUND RELATED PRODUCTS DIVISION  BUT OFTEN THE EXPERTISE REQUIRED SITS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BANK  THE FIRST BANKER SAID AS SUBSCRIPTION LINES EFFECTIVELY BRIDGE LP INVESTORS COMMITMENTS  ANY POSSIBLE FUNDING EXCEPTIONS NEED ALSO NEED INCREASINGLY CAREFUL CONSIDERATION  SIDE LETTERS CAN ALLOW LP INVESTORS  INCLUDING HIGH NET WORTH INDIVIDUALS  PENSION AND INSURANCE FUNDS AND SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS  TO POTENTIALLY AVOID FUNDING THERE ARE MORE MOST FAVOURED NATION CLAUSES TODAY IN SIDE LETTERS WHICH CAN INCREASE THE RISK OF LPS BEING ABLE TO WALK AWAY FROM FUND COMMITMENTS IN EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES  THIS INCREASES THE NEED TO REVIEW AND UNDERSTAND THE SIDE LETTERS WHICH APPEAR TO BE GETTING MORE COMPLEX  SAID LEE DOYLE  GLOBAL HEAD OF BANK INDUSTRY AT ASHURST IN LONDON SOME SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS HAVE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY THAT COULD ALLOW THEM NOT TO BE CALLED ON FUNDING COMMITMENTS WHICH PROVIDE SECURITY FOR SUBSCRIPTION LINES AND SOME US STATE PUBLIC PENSION FUNDS CAN ALSO BE EXEMPT  WHICH IS PROMPTING LENDERS TO DO MORE INTENSIVE DUE DILIGENCE  WHEN YOU SEE FUNDS WITH FEWER LPS  AND ESPECIALLY WITH SINGLE INVESTOR SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS  DUE TO THE LACK OF DIVERSITY THERE COULD INHERENTLY BE MORE RISK  DOYLE ADDED  IN EUROPE THERE IS CERTAINLY MORE DUE DILIGENCE DONE ON LPS AND THE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS THAN TWO YEARS AGO ALTHOUGH THERE IS A HIGH REPUTATION RISK FOR LPS NOT TO LEND  SOME BANKS WERE BURNED IN THE LAST CRISIS AND STILL WILL NOT

20180503,business,business,8,WASHINGTON  THE DISCLOSURE BY RUDOLPH W  GIULIANI THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP REPAID HIS LONGTIME PERSONAL LAWYER  MICHAEL D  COHEN  FOR THE  000 HUSH MONEY PAYMENT MADE TO A PORNOGRAPHIC ACTRESS SHORTLY BEFORE THE 2016 ELECTION HAS PUT NEW SCRUTINY ON THE LEGAL ISSUES RAISED BY THE UNUSUAL TRANSACTION MR  TRUMP HAS NEVER REPORTED THIS EXPENDITURE  LOAN OR REPAYMENT  EITHER IN CAMPAIGN FILINGS WITH THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION OR ON HIS FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORM WITH THE GOVERNMENT ETHICS OFFICE  BUT IT REMAINS MURKY WHAT EXACTLY MR  TRUMP KNEW  AND WHEN HE LEARNED IT DO CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS APPLY A THRESHOLD QUESTION IS WHETHER THE PAYMENT TO THE ACTRESS  STEPHANIE CLIFFORD  WHO GOES BY THE STAGE NAME STORMY DANIELS  WAS INTENDED TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION BY SUPPRESSING A CLAIM THAT COULD HURT MR  TRUMPS CHANCES  IF SO  THE TRANSACTION WAS MOST LIKELY COVERED BY FEDERAL CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS THOSE LAWS BARRED CANDIDATES SUPPORTERS FROM MAKING DONATIONS  INCLUDING IN KIND DONATIONS  WORTH MORE THAN  700 TO PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS DURING THE 2016 GENERAL ELECTION  AND WHILE THOSE LAWS ALLOW CANDIDATES TO SPEND AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF THEIR OWN MONEY TO HELP THEIR CAMPAIGNS  THEY REQUIRE THE CANDIDATES TO DISCLOSE SUCH SELF FUNDING  BOTH AS DONATIONS TO THEIR CAMPAIGNS AND AS EXPENDITURES  BUT IF THE MOTIVE FOR THE PAYMENT WAS UNRELATED TO THE ELECTION  THEN IT WAS NOT COVERED BY THOSE LAWS RECENT HISTORY SUGGESTS THAT IT CAN BE TRICKY TO PROVE THAT THE MOTIVE BEHIND SUCH A PAYMENT WAS POLITICAL RATHER THAN PERSONAL  IN 2012  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PROSECUTED JOHN EDWARDS  THE FORMER DEMOCRATIC SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA  OVER PAYMENTS FROM WEALTHY DONORS THAT WERE USED TO HIDE HIS PREGNANT MISTRESS WHILE HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT  MR  EDWARDSS LAWYERS ARGUED THAT HE WAS INSTEAD TRYING TO HIDE THE AFFAIR FROM HIS WIFE IN THE END  A JURY ACQUITTED MR  EDWARDS OF ONE CHARGE WHILE DEADLOCKING ON THE OTHER FIVE  AND PROSECUTORS OPTED NOT TO SEEK A NEW TRIAL  RICHARD L  HASEN  A PROFESSOR OF LAW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA  IRVINE  SAID THAT AFTER THE EDWARDS MISTRIAL  FEDERAL PROSECUTORS WILL BE RELUCTANT TO GO FORWARD WITH SIMILAR CASES UNLESS THEY HAVE DOCUMENTARY PROOF  A SMOKING GUN  THAT A PAYMENT WAS IN FACT ELECTION RELATED WHAT IS THE ARGUMENT THAT THE PAYMENT WAS NOT CAMPAIGN RELATED IN AN INTERVIEW ON THURSDAY ON THE FOX NEWS PROGRAM FOX   FRIENDS  MR  GIULIANI INSISTED THAT THE PAYMENT WAS NOT A CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION  HE SAID MR  COHEN WAS TRYING TO HELP MR  TRUMPS FAMILY TO SAVE THEIR MARRIAGE  NOT THEIR MARRIAGE SO MUCH AS THEIR REPUTATION  BUT THEN  MUDDYING THAT MESSAGE  MR  GIULIANI SAID  IMAGINE IF THAT CAME OUT ON OCT  15  2016  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST DEBATE WITH HILLARY CLINTON  SEPARATELY  IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE NEW YORK TIMES  MR  GIULIANI ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT COULD OVERLAP AS A CAMPAIGN PROBLEM  BUT REITERATED THAT MR  TRUMP WAS NOT THINKING OF THE PAYMENT AS A CAMPAIGN EXPENSE IT COULD WORK IN MR  TRUMPS FAVOR THAT HE AND HIS LAWYERS HAD A LONG HISTORY OF USING LEGAL AVENUES TO TRY TO FIGHT OFF DAMAGING CLAIMS  THAT HISTORY COULD FORM THE BASIS OF AN ARGUMENT THAT MR  COHENS PAYMENT TO MS  CLIFFORD  AND MR  TRUMPS REIMBURSEMENT OF IT  WOULD HAVE HAPPENED WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IF THIS WAS A FIRST TIME CANDIDATE WITHOUT A PUBLIC REPUTATION  THEN IT WOULD BE HARDER TO ARGUE THAT IT WASNT AN EXPENDITURE TO INFLUENCE AN ELECTION  SAID CHARLES SPIES  A REPUBLICAN ELECTION LAWYER WHO WORKED IN SUPPORT OF ONE OF MR  TRUMPS RIVALS  THE FORMER FLORIDA GOVERNOR JEB BUSH  IN THE 2016 REPUBLICAN PRIMARY  BUT DONALD TRUMP HAS A LONG RECORD OF AGGRESSIVELY DEFENDING HIS REPUTATION FROM ATTACKS THAT TRACK RECORD COULD PROVE LESS COMPELLING IF THE AUTHORITIES OBTAIN EVIDENCE THAT MR  COHEN PRIVATELY DISCUSSED THE PAYMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF MR  TRUMPS CAMPAIGN  LAST MONTH  FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS IN NEW YORK RAIDED MR  COHENS OFFICE AND HOTEL ROOM  CARTING AWAY NUMEROUS DOCUMENTS AND ELECTRONIC DEVICES THAT ARE NOW THE SUBJECT OF A FIGHT OVER ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE  ONE OF THE THINGS THEY ARE APPARENTLY INVESTIGATING IS THE PAYMENT TO MS  CLIFFORD IF THE PAYMENT WAS A LOAN  IS COHEN OUT OF TROUBLE NOT IF THE LOAN WAS INTENDED TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION  CAMPAIGNS ROUTINELY TAKE OUT LARGE LOANS FROM BANKS WHEN THEYRE RUNNING SHORT OF CASH AHEAD OF ELECTIONS  BUT FEDERAL ELECTION LAWS REQUIRE THAT THOSE LOANS COME FROM BANKS AS ROUTINE BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS  PERSONAL LOANS COUNT AS CONTRIBUTIONS THAT ARE STILL LEGALLY CAPPED AT THE INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION LIMIT  EVEN IF THEY ARE LATER REPAID IN FULL  ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION WEBSITE WHEN WOULD THIS HAVE HAD TO BE REPORTED  AND BY WHOM IF THE PAYMENT WERE TO BE DEEMED CAMPAIGN RELATED  THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SHOULD HAVE DISCLOSED IT IN ITS PERIODIC FILINGS WITH THE F E C  AS SOON AS MR  TRUMP OR HIS CAMPAIGN LEARNED THAT MR  COHEN HAD MADE IT  IF MR  TRUMP OR HIS CAMPAIGN ONLY DISCOVERED THE PAYMENT AFTER THE FACT  THEY SHOULD HAVE AMENDED THEIR PREVIOUS FILINGS TO REFLECT THE EXPENDITURE  AND ANY REIMBURSEMENTS TO MR  COHEN  THE WALL STREET JOURNAL FIRST REPORTED THE  000 PAYMENT TO MS  CLIFFORD IN JANUARY  AND MR  TRUMP HAS NOT MOVED TO AMEND HIS DISCLOSURES IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE TIMES  MR  GIULIANI WAS VAGUE ABOUT KEY QUESTIONS CONCERNING WHAT MR  TRUMP KNEW AND WHEN HE KNEW IT  SAYING THAT MR  TRUMP DID KNOW THAT THERE WAS A FORM OF REIMBURSEMENTS TO MR  COHEN OVER THE COURSE OF 2017  BUT MAINTAINING THAT THE PRESIDENT DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS FOR SPECIFICALLY  MR  GIULIANI ALSO SAID THAT SOME EXECUTIVES AT THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION KNEW ABOUT THE FACT THAT COHEN BELIEVES MONEY WAS OWED TO HIM  I DONT KNOW WHEN THAT CAME UP MIGHT A LOAN RAISE NON ELECTION LAW ISSUES YES  AS A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE  MR  TRUMP IS ALSO REQUIRED TO REPORT ANY LIABILITIES IN EXCESS OF  000 ON A FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORM FILED WITH THE OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT ETHICS  HIS 2017 FORM  WHICH HE SIGNED IN JUNE  CERTIFYING IT WAS TRUE  COMPLETE AND CORRECT  DOES NOT LIST ANY OUTSTANDING LOAN FROM MR  COHEN  CAMPAIGN RELATED OR OTHERWISE  WHEN HE SPOKE WITH THE TIMES ON THURSDAY  MR  GIULIANI DID NOT ANSWER WHY THE MONEY WAS NOT LISTED ON THE PRESIDENTS FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORM WHAT COULD THE PENALTIES BE WHEN CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATIONS ARE PUNISHED  THEY TYPICALLY RESULT IN FINES BY THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION THAT ARE PEGGED TO THE SIZE OF THE UNLAWFUL CONTRIBUTION OR EXPENDITURE  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CAN ALSO PROSECUTE WILLFUL VIOLATIONS OF ELECTION LAWS  OR WILLFUL FALSE STATEMENTS ON THE FEDERAL PERSONAL FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORMS  WHICH ARE FELONIES AND CAN RESULT IN UP TO FIVE YEARS IN PRISON THERE IS LITTLE CHANCE THAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD FILE CHARGES AGAINST MR  TRUMP  REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE EVIDENCE SHOWS  BECAUSE ITS OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL HAS OPINED THAT THE CONSTITUTION MAKES SITTING PRESIDENTS IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION BUT MR  COHEN  AFTER THE RAID LAST MONTH  IS UNDER INTENSE LEGAL PRESSURE

HARRIS FIRST MET IN OCTOBER 2014  THROUGH BARBARA AUGUSTIN  A MUTUAL FRIEND WHO ARRANGED FOR THE THREE OF THEM TO HAVE DINNER AT A BROOKLYN RESTAURANT BOTH ELIZABETH AND MICHAEL ARE REALLY GRACIOUS  HOSPITABLE AND FRIENDLY PEOPLE  EACH WITH A WACKY SENSE OF HUMOR  MS  AUGUSTIN SAID  THEY ARE ALSO VERY MUCH GROUNDED IN THEIR CHRISTIAN FAITH  WHICH IS WHY I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER  BUT AS IT TURNED OUT  THE TIMING JUST WASNT RIGHT FOR THEM AS BOTH WERE GOING THROUGH DIFFICULT TIMES  SO THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO SPARK MS  CUNNINGHAM  WHO GREW UP IN ROOSEVELT  N Y  RECEIVED A BACHELORS DEGREE IN THEATER ARTS FROM N Y U  AND A MASTERS DEGREE IN ACTING AT COLUMBIA BEFORE HEADING TO LOS ANGELES IN JUNE 2004  IN THE HOPE OF BECOMING AN ACTRESS  THOUGH SHE FOUND SOME WORK  SHE ABANDONED HER DREAM IN SEPTEMBER 2013 WHEN SHE RETURNED HOME TO BE THE PRIMARY CARETAKER FOR HER MOTHER  HERMA CUNNINGHAM  WHO HAD CANCER I THOUGHT MICHAEL WAS A GOOD LOOKING GUY  BUT I WAS SO DISTRACTED BY MY MOTHERS SITUATION THAT WHEN I GOT TO THE RESTAURANT  IM NOT EVEN SURE I SHOOK HIS HAND  MS  CUNNINGHAM SAID  I DONT THINK THERE WAS A PARAGRAPH OF SENTENCES SPOKEN BETWEEN US THAT NIGHT MR  HARRIS  WHO IS NOW 45  GREW UP IN DETROIT AND GRADUATED FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN IN ANN ARBOR  HE WENT ON TO RECEIVE AN M B A  FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA IN CHAPEL HILL  DURING HIS LAST SEMESTER AT NORTH CAROLINA  HE COMPLETED A FOUR MONTH GRADUATE LEVEL STUDY ABROAD PROGRAM AT THE STOCKHOLM SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS  MR  HARRIS  WHO IS ALSO A CHARTERED FINANCIAL ANALYST  WAS SINGLE AND WORKING AS A CONTROLLER AT A DATA CENTER IN MANHATTAN WHEN HE MET MS  CUNNINGHAM THAT SPARKLESS MEETING DID NOTHING TO ENHANCE MR  HARRISS SELF CONFIDENCE  AS HE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A MIDLIFE CRISIS IN SOME RESPECTS OF MY LIFE  I FELT I HAD ACHIEVED WHAT I WANTED TO ACHIEVE  HE SAID  BUT I SAW THAT A LOT OF MY FRIENDS WERE GETTING MARRIED AND HAVING KIDS AND THEY ALL STARTED DISAPPEARING ON ME NEW YORK MIGHT BE FILLED WITH EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE  BUT FOR ME  IT FELT MORE LIKE I HAD BECOME A PART OF A CERTAIN KIND OF CROWDED LONELINESS  AND ALL OF THE GLASS HALF EMPTY THINGS ABOUT NEW YORK REALLY STARTED GETTING ON MY NERVES THEY MOVED ON  BUT KEPT LIMITED TABS ON EACH OTHER THROUGH FACEBOOK AND OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IN JULY 2015  MR  HARRIS MOVED TO DENVER  AND TOOK A YEAR OFF WORK  HE BEGAN LOOKING FOR A JOB IN FEBRUARY 2016  AFTER FALLING OFF HIS SNOWBOARD AND DISLOCATING A SHOULDER  IN JULY  HE LANDED A JOB AS AN INVESTMENT BANKER THERE FIVE MONTHS LATER  MR  HARRIS RETURNED TO NEW YORK TO ATTEND A FRIENDS ANNUAL CHRISTMAS PARTY AND CROSSED PATHS WITH MS  AUGUSTIN  SHE TOLD HIM THAT MS  CUNNINGHAMS MOTHER HAD ONLY WEEKS TO LIVE  SADDENED  MR  HARRIS REACHED OUT TO MS  CUNNINGHAM VIA TEXT MESSAGE  SETTING IN MOTION THE FIRST OF FIVE PRONGS NOTICE  A PHONE CALL AND A KISSMS  CUNNINGHAM WAS A BIT SHOCKED TO HEAR FROM MR  HARRIS AGAIN  IT WAS REALLY OUT OF THE BLUE  SHE SAID THEY AGREED TO MEET FOR DRINKS  MR  HARRIS ARRIVED EARLY  BUT THE NOISE INSIDE THE BAR SEEMED LIKE THE WRONG SETTING FOR A SOBER CATCH UP CONVERSATION THAT WOULD INCLUDE A DYING MOTHER AS HE WAITED FOR HER  THE CLIENT FOR HIS FIRST EVER INVESTMENT BANKING DEAL CALLED FROM LOS ANGELES  HE WAS STILL ANSWERING QUESTIONS WHEN MS  CUNNINGHAM ARRIVED  CREATING AN AWKWARD SITUATION WHERE SHE WAS NOW WAITING FOR HIM TO GET OFF THE PHONE ITS TOO NOISY IN THERE  HE MOUTHED TO HER AS HE LED HER OUTSIDE TO THE CORNER OF FIFTH AVENUE AND EAST 36TH STREET  WHERE MS  CUNNINGHAM CONTINUED TO WAIT PATIENTLY  THIS TIME IN THE BITTER COLD MR  HARRIS WAS STILL TALKING FIVE MINUTES LATER WHEN HE LOOKED AT MS  CUNNINGHAM  AND NOTING HER PATIENCE AND GRACE  GAVE HER AN UNEXPECTED PECK ON THE CHEEK MS  CUNNINGHAM  A VERY CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN  CALLED IT A SHOCKING MOMENT  BUT A NICE ONE I HAD NEVER KISSED HIM BEFORE  AND NOW WERE OUT IN THE COLD AND HES ON THE PHONE AND JUST COMES UP TO ME AND KISSES MY CHEEK  I WAS LIKE  WHO IS THIS GUY MR  HARRIS FINALLY ENDED HIS CALL AND THEY WALKED ACROSS THE STREET TO ANOTHER RESTAURANT  THE ARCHIVE  THIS TIME AROUND  SPARKS FLEW  WHILE GETTING CAUGHT UP ON THE TWO PREVIOUS YEARS SINCE THEY LAST SAW EACH OTHER I THOUGHT HE WAS VERY SMART  VERY FUNNY AND A GIFTED CONVERSATIONALIST  MS  CUNNINGHAM SAID  I FELT LIKE HE WAS REALLY INTO WHO I WAS AND INTERESTED IN ME OUTSIDE OF THE REALM OF BEING A CARETAKER  BY THE TIME WE LEFT  I WANTED TO GET TO KNOW HIM MORE BUT I WASNT SURE IF IT WOULD HAPPEN  I CALLED BARBARA AND SAID O K  WHO IS THIS MICHAEL DUDE  WHATS HIS STORY  DOES HE HAVE A GIRLFRIEND INTEREST  COMFORTING AND CARINGA MONTH LATER  MR  HARRIS WAS BACK IN DENVER  WHERE HE WORKS AS AN ASSOCIATE WITH THE INVESTMENT BANK W G  NIELSEN   COMPANY  AND TALKING WITH MS  CUNNINGHAM MOST NIGHTS VIA FACETIME   THERE WERE TIMES WHEN HE COULD HEAR HER AILING MOTHER  WHO WAS IN PAIN  IN THE BACKGROUND MICHAEL BECAME A GIFT OF COMFORT  MS  CUNNINGHAM SAID  I HAD FRIENDS WHO PRAYED FOR ME AND ASKED GOD TO SEND ME SOME COMFORT DURING THIS ROUGH TIME IN MY LIFE  AND UNTIL I MET MICHAEL  I DIDNT KNOW THAT COMFORT WOULD COME IN THE FORM OF A MAN  HE WAS KEEPING MY SPIRITS UP IN THE MIDNIGHT HOUR  AND I FELT TRULY BLESSED IT WAS DURING THOSE LATE NIGHT CONVERSATIONS THAT MR  HARRIS CAME TO SEE THAT HE TOO HAD BEEN BLESSED  AND THAT HE TOO HAD FOUND COMFORT  HIS IN A WOMAN I TRULY VALUED HER LOVE AND DEDICATION TO HER MOTHER AND I ADMIRED HOW CALM SHE WAS DURING SUCH A TRAGIC TIME IN HER LIFE  HE SAID IN FEBRUARY 2017  MS  CUNNINGHAMS MOTHER DIED  AND MR  HARRIS WENT TO NEW YORK FOR THE FUNERAL  DURING THE BURIAL  HE TOOK MY HAND AND MY ENTIRE FAMILY WAS LIKE  WHAT  WHO IS THIS PERSON  MS  CUNNINGHAM SAID  MUCH LIKE THAT FIRST TIME HE SURPRISED ME WITH A KISS  HE HAD SHOCKED ME AGAIN  BUT DEEP INSIDE  I WANTED HIM NEXT TO ME MR  HARRIS  WHOSE MOTHER  BERTHA HARRIS  DIED IN 1998  SAID  I GRABBED ELIZABETHS HAND BECAUSE I HAD WALKED THIS SAME PAINFUL ROAD BEFORE  AND I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO COPE WITH  SO I WANTED TO SHARE THAT PAIN WITH HER LIKE  A LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPA MONTH AFTER THE FUNERAL  MS  CUNNINGHAM JOINED MR  HARRIS AND HIS FRIENDS ON A SKI TRIP IN KEYSTONE  COLO  THEY VISITED PIKES PEAK NEAR COLORADO SPRINGS  BUT THE PEAK WAS CLOSED BECAUSE OF SNOW AND ICE  AND THEY COULD ONLY ASCEND TO ABOUT 12 000 FEET  WHILE UP IN THE CLOUDS  MR  HARRIS SURPRISED MS  CUNNINGHAM WITH WHAT HE CALLED A PROPOSAL  ASKING HER TO BE HIS GIRLFRIEND WHEN SHE SAID YES  HE PRESENTED HER WITH A DIAMOND ENCRUSTED HEART SHAPED SILVER NECKLACE AS A WAY OF SYMBOLIZING THAT SHE NOW OWNED A PART OF HIS HEART AT THAT POINT IN MY LIFE  I WAS IN NEED OF A CERTAIN LEVEL OF SOFTNESS  AND MICHAEL PROVIDED IT  MS  CUNNINGHAM SAID  I CAME TO REALIZE THAT HE IS A LOVING GUY WITH AN AMAZING LEVEL OF DETAIL AND THOUGHTFULNESS THEY SOON EMBARKED ON A LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP LOVE  SOMEONE TO LEAN ONIN NOVEMBER OF THAT YEAR  MS  CUNNINGHAM SUFFERED ANOTHER EMOTIONAL SETBACK WITH THE UNEXPECTED DEATH OF HER FATHER  DONOVAN CUNNINGHAM LOSING BOTH OF MY PARENTS IN THE SPACE OF NINE MONTHS WAS REALLY DEVASTATING  SHE SAID  IN MANY WAYS IM A STRONG AND INDEPENDENT WOMAN  BUT SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED TO CRY AND HAVE SOMEONE HOLD AND COMFORT YOU  SO I THANK GOD THAT I HAD MICHAEL TO LEAN ON AT THAT POINT IN MY LIFE BY THEN  MS  CUNNINGHAM AND MR  HARRIS HAD ALREADY BEGAN DISCUSSING THEIR FUTURE TOGETHER  THOUGH SHE ASSUMED THAT THEY WOULD NOT GET ENGAGED UNTIL 2018  MR  HARRIS  WHO BY NOW OWNED A CONDO IN DENVER  HAD OTHER IDEAS HE WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO SURPRISE HER WITH A PROPOSAL ON THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THEIR MEETING  ON DEC  20  2017  MR  HARRIS GOT DOWN ON ONE KNEE AND GAVE MS  CUNNINGHAM A CANARY YELLOW HEART SHAPED ENGAGEMENT RING  THEY WERE BACK IN FRONT OF THE ARCHIVE  ON THE CORNER OF FIFTH AVENUE AND EAST 36TH STREET  THE SAME CORNER HE HAD SHOCKED HER WITH A FIRST KISS FRIENDS AND FAMILY HAD WAITED PATIENTLY INSIDE THE ARCHIVE AND THEN SURPRISED THE BRIDE WITH LOUD CHEERS AND APPLAUSE WHEN THE COUPLE STEPPED INSIDE IT WAS THE BEST SURPRISE OF MY LIFE  MS  CUNNINGHAM SAID  HAVING SEEN MANY OF THOSE SAME PEOPLE AT THE FUNERALS OF MY PARENTS  IT WAS QUITE A STARK DIFFERENCE  A COMPLETELY EXCITING MOMENT CREATED BY MICHAEL THAT I

20180505,sports,baseball,6,WHEN THE YANKEES TRADED FOR GIANCARLO STANTON IN DECEMBER  ADDING ONE OF BASEBALLS BEST SLUGGERS TO AN ALREADY POTENT ROSTER  IT WAS LOGICAL TO THINK THAT THE 2018 CLUB MIGHT COMPARE TO SOME OF THE BEST YANKEES TEAMS OF RECENT DECADES THERE WERE EVEN SUGGESTIONS THAT THE CURRENT GROUP OF PLAYERS WOULD MEASURE UP TO THE 1998 YANKEES TEAM THAT WON 114 GAMES IN THE REGULAR SEASON AND THEN SWEPT THE SAN DIEGO PADRES IN THE WORLD SERIES SUCH LOFTY AMBITIONS WILL STILL REQUIRE ANOTHER FIVE MONTHS OF DILIGENT WORK  BUT THE 2018 YANKEES SEEM TO BE CHANNELING THEIR 1998 PREDECESSORS  WITH THEIR 5 2 VICTORY OVER THE CLEVELAND INDIANS ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON  THE YANKEES WON FOR THE 14TH TIME IN THEIR LAST 15 GAMES  THE LAST YANKEES TEAM TO ENJOY A 14 1 STRETCH  THE 1998 YANKEES  OF COURSE WEVE BEEN ABLE TO WIN WHETHER WE HAVE TO SCORE WITH YOU OR WHETHER WE HAVE TO WIN A LOW SCORING GAME  MANAGER AARON BOONE SAID  WERE FINDING WAYS TO WIN BALL GAMES  AND THATS  HOPEFULLY  THE SIGN OF A GOOD TEAM WITHOUT DIDI GREGORIUS OR GARY SANCHEZ IN THE LINEUP ON SATURDAY  BOTH WERE GIVEN THE DAY OFF  THE YANKEES SCROUNGED FOUR RUNS OFF CLEVELAND STARTER TREVOR BAUER IN THE FIFTH INNING BY SCORING ONCE ON A BASES LOADED WALK  TWICE ON A DOUBLE ERROR BY SHORTSTOP FRANCISCO LINDOR THAT MIGHT HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN AN INNING ENDING DOUBLE PLAY AND ONCE ON A SACRIFICE FLY ON THE FLY BALL  CLEVELAND OUTFIELDER MICHAEL BRANTLEY SEEMED TO THROW OUT RONALD TORREYES  TRYING TO ADVANCE FROM SECOND TO THIRD  IN ADDITION  TORREYES WAS APPARENTLY TAGGED BEFORE AUSTIN ROMINE CROSSED HOME PLATE WITH THE FOURTH RUN  BUT THE INDIANS CHOSE NOT TO APPEAL SO IT GOES FOR THE YANKEES  WHO CANT DO ANYTHING WRONG EVEN WHEN MAYBE THEY DID DO SOMETHING WRONG  INDEED  SATURDAYS GAME WAS THE FIRST TIME THE YANKEES HAVE NOT HIT A HOME RUN AT HOME SINCE APRIL 8  BUT THAT DIDNT MATTER  EITHER WHEN THIS 15 GAME SEGMENT BEGAN ON APRIL 21  THE YANKEES WERE 9 9 ON THE SEASON AND IN THIRD PLACE IN THE AMERICAN LEAGUE EAST  SEVEN AND A HALF GAMES BEHIND THE BOSTON RED SOX  BUT WITH SATURDAYS VICTORY  FOLLOWED BY THE RED SOX VICTORY LATER AGAINST THE TEXAS RANGERS  THE YANKEES  23 10  ARE ONE GAME BACK OF BOSTON  24 9 DURING THESE 15 GAMES  THE YANKEES HAVE OUTSCORED THEIR OPPONENTS BY A LOPSIDED 91 33 MARGIN  AND YANKEES PITCHERS HAVE COMPILED A STUNNING 2 00 EARNED RUN AVERAGE  BOONE ALSO NOTED THAT THE YANKEES DEFENSE HAS LOOKED BETTER  TOO IN FACT  ONE OF THE FEW THINGS THAT YANKEES FANS COULD COMPLAIN ABOUT RECENTLY WERE THE PERFORMANCES OF STARTING PITCHER SONNY GRAY  BUT EVEN THAT HAS CHANGED ON SATURDAY  GRAY PITCHED WELL FOR THE SECOND STRAIGHT OUTING  AGAIN THRIVING WITH ROMINE BEHIND THE PLATE  GRAY ALLOWED JUST TWO RUNS AND FOUR HITS OVER SIX INNINGS TO EARN HIS SECOND WIN OF THE SEASON  AGAINST TWO LOSSES  HIS PREVIOUS START CAME IN THE YANKEES ONE LOSS IN THE LAST 15 GAMES  A 2 1 DEFEAT IN HOUSTON  BUT IN THAT INSTANCE GRAY PUT UP ALMOST THE SAME IMPRESSIVE NUMBERS THAT HE DID ON SATURDAY AND ON THE MOUND AGAINST THE INDIANS  GRAY LOOKED MORE CONFIDENT THAN HE DID EARLIER IN THE SEASON HE HAD THAT LOOK IN HIS EYE  BOONE SAID  EVEN AFTER THE GAME TALKING TO HIM  HE FELT REALLY GOOD ABOUT IT GRAY SAID HE ALWAYS HAS PLENTY OF CONFIDENCE IN HIMSELF  BUT HE ALSO PRAISED ROMINE FOR THE WORK HE HAS DONE IN COAXING A MORE AGGRESSIVE APPROACH FROM HIM I TRUST THAT GUY COMPLETELY  GRAY SAID OF ROMINE  HE ADDED THAT IF HE IS ASKED TO THROW TO SANCHEZ AGAIN  HE WOULD BE FINE WITH THAT  TOO  BUT CLEARLY THERE IS A SOLID CONNECTION DEVELOPING BETWEEN GRAY AND ROMINE  WHICH THE YANKEES ARE READY TO STICK WITH IF IT BENEFITS GRAY THE YANKEES ALSO WANT ROMINE TO INCREASE HIS OFFENSIVE PRODUCTION SO THAT HE CAN PLAY MORE AND ALLOW SANCHEZ TO EITHER REST OR STAY IN THE LINEUP AS THE DESIGNATED HITTER  BOONE SAID HE CHALLENGED ROMINE IN SPRING TRAINING TO DEVELOP AS A HITTER  AND ON SATURDAY HE SHOWED BOTH PATIENCE AND POP ROMINE WAS 1 FOR 2 WITH A WALK AND IS BATTING  286 ON THE SEASON  HE DREW THE BASES LOADED WALK IN THE FIFTH THAT GAVE THE YANKEES THEIR FIRST RUN AFTER BAUER HAD SET DOWN THE FIRST 12 BATTERS HE FACED  LATER  ROMINE DOUBLED OFF THE WALL AGAINST RELIEVER BEN TAYLOR ON A PLAY WHERE CENTER FIELDER BRADLEY ZIMMER CRASHED HARD INTO THE WALL BADLY SHAKEN  ZIMMER LEFT THE GAME WITH A SHOULDER CONTUSION AND ROMINE LATER SCORED ON A SINGLE BY BRETT GARDNER FOR THE YANKEES FINAL RUN  ROMINE IS NOT THE HITTER SANCHEZ IS  BUT HIS ROLE AS A BACKUP CATCHER IS MORE NARROWLY DEFINED  AND HE WAS THRILLED TO HEAR ABOUT GRAYS UNQUALIFIED FAITH IN HIM ITS A HUGE COMPLIMENT  ROMINE SAID  THIS IS HIS CAREER  HES THROWING THE PITCHES AND ITS HIS E R A  THE ONE THING YOURE STRIVING FOR IS WHEN A PITCHER WANTS TO THROW TO YOU AND TRUSTS YOU SANCHEZ IS EXPECTED BACK IN THE LINEUP ON SUNDAY  THEN  ON TUESDAY  THE RED SOX ARRIVE  AND THE YANKEES HAVE A CHANCE TO KEEP UP THEIR RED HOT PLAY AND MOVE RIGHT PAST THEIR DIVISION RIVALS  NOT THAT BOONE PLANNED TO STAY UP LATE ON SATURDAY NIGHT TO WATCH BOSTON PLAY IN TEXAS  ITS MAY AFTER ALL  NOT SEPTEMBER INSTEAD  HE SAID  HE HAD PLANS FOR A NICE DINNER  I DONT GET CAUGHT UP IN IT IN THE LEAST  HE SAID OF THE STANDINGS  AT LEAST NOT YET
20180502,politics,north korea,4,JERUSALEM  IN THREE BOLD MOVES THIS WEEK  WITH F 15S  A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION AND THE PASSAGE OF A CONTENTIOUS NEW LAW  PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU HAS STRENGTHENED HIS HAND IN TRYING TO FOIL IRANS STRATEGIC AMBITIONS  WHILE POTENTIALLY PULLING THE TWO NATIONS CLOSER TO DIRECT CONFLICT IN SYRIA LATE SUNDAY  F 15S  WIDELY ASSUMED TO BE ISRAELS  STRUCK FACILITIES WHERE IRAN AND ITS PROXIES HAD ENTRENCHED THEMSELVES  THE ATTACK ON A STORAGE SITE NEAR HAMA DESTROYED 200 MISSILES AND KILLED AT LEAST 16 PEOPLE  11 OF THEM IRANIANS IN TEL AVIV THE NEXT EVENING  MR  NETANYAHU GAVE A BRAVURA POWERPOINT PERFORMANCE ON LIVE TELEVISION FROM INSIDE THE DEFENSE MINISTRY  FLAUNTING THE BOOTY PILFERED FROM A SECRET TEHRAN WAREHOUSE BY AN INTREPID MOSSAD TEAM  EVIDENCE  HE SAID  OF IRANIAN DECEIT ABOUT ITS LONG RUNNING EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A NUCLEAR BOMB THE REVELATION CAME LESS THAN TWO WEEKS BEFORE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TO ANNOUNCE A DECISION ON WHETHER TO WITHDRAW FROM THE INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT TO CURB IRANS NUCLEAR PROGRAM  ISRAELI OFFICIALS PORTRAYED IT AS AN ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE MR  TRUMP  MR  NETANYAHUS CLOSE ALLY  WITH BACKING FOR THE DECISION  WHICH THEY BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY MADE EVEN AS MR  NETANYAHU WAS SPEAKING  HIS COALITION IN PARLIAMENT WAS PUSHING THROUGH A BILL THAT WOULD SHIFT THE POWER TO GO TO WAR OR CARRY OUT A MILITARY OPERATION FROM THE FULL CABINET TO THE SMALLER SECURITY CABINET  AND  UNDER EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES  ALLOW THE PRIME MINISTER AND DEFENSE MINISTER ALONE TO ORDER SUCH ACTION IN SHORT ORDER  MR  NETANYAHU HAD MANAGED TO EXPLOIT IMPORTANT POLITICAL  MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE ADVANTAGES TO ADVANCE HIS AGENDA ON BOTH THE NUCLEAR AND CONVENTIONAL FRONTS  INTENSIFY THE PRESSURE ON IRAN  AND FREE HIS HAND UNDER ISRAELI LAW TO TAKE THE COUNTRY TO WAR WITHOUT CABINET APPROVAL TAKEN TOGETHER  HIS MOVES HAVE PROMPTED LONGTIME OBSERVERS OF THE PRIME MINISTER  WHOM THEY HAVE LONG CREDITED WITH A HEALTHY AVERSION TO ALL OUT WARFARE  TO ASK IF HE MAY HAVE TURNED TO A GRIM NEW WAY OF THINKING ALL THESE YEARS HE WAS TRIGGER UNHAPPY  SAID NAHUM BARNEA  A RESPECTED COLUMNIST AT YEDIOT AHRONOTH  AND I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD APPRECIATE HIM FOR BEING SO CAUTIOUS ABOUT USING MILITARY POWER  NOW  IT SEEMS THAT HE IS PUSHING EVERYBODY TOWARD A MORE HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT MR  BARNEA SAID THE HOSTILE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT MR  NETANYAHU FACES COULD ALSO BE A FACTOR  HE IS AWAITING A LIKELY INDICTMENT IN A SPRAWLING CORRUPTION SCANDAL  HE IS BELIEVED TO WANT TO HOLD ELECTIONS BEFORE ANY CRIMINAL CHARGES MATERIALIZE  AND HE HAS BEEN PRESENTING HIMSELF TO HIS POLITICAL BASE AS THE ONLY ISRAELI LEADER CAPABLE OF KEEPING THE COUNTRY SAFE I DONT RULE OUT ANY REASON  MR  BARNEA SAID  AND IM SURE THERE IS MORE THAN ONE REASON ALL THREE ACTIONS THIS WEEK FURTHER MR  NETANYAHUS LONGTIME GOALS AS EARLY AS 2010  HE SOUGHT TO PREPARE FOR AN ATTACK ON IRANS NUCLEAR FACILITIES  BUT WAS STOPPED REPEATEDLY BY HIS OWN CABINET  HE RAILED AGAINST THE 2015 IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT FROM ITS INCEPTION UNDER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA  CONTENDING IT WOULD ALLOW TEHRAN TO THREATEN ISRAEL WITH ATOMIC WEAPONS WITHIN A DECADES TIME  AND HE HAS VOWED FOR MONTHS TO PREVENT IRAN FROM ESTABLISHING A CONVENTIONAL OFFENSIVE THREAT TO ISRAEL FROM INSIDE SYRIA THE NEW WAR POWERS LAW  APPROVED MONDAY ON A VOTE OF 62 TO 41  WAS NOT WRITTEN WITH THE CURRENT SKIRMISHES WITH IRAN OR THE CURRENT PRIME MINISTER AND DEFENSE MINISTER IN MIND  ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE MEASURES ARCHITECTS STILL  CRITICS NOTE THAT THE CORRUPTION CASES AGAINST MR  NETANYAHU  AND THE LACK OF SECURITY EXPERIENCE IN HIS DEFENSE MINISTER  AVIGDOR LIEBERMAN  COULD RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR MOTIVATIONS SHOULD THEY DECIDE TO TAKE ISRAEL TO WAR AND WHILE THE POWER APPLIES ONLY IN EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES  THE LAW DOES NOT DEFINE WHAT THOSE ARE SOME EXPERTS SAID THE NEW LAW MAY NOT HAVE A DRAMATIC EFFECT  THE PRIME MINISTER AND DEFENSE MINISTER ARE UNLIKELY TO GO TO WAR WITHOUT STRONG POLITICAL BACKING AND THE SUPPORT OF THE MILITARY AND SECURITY AGENCIES  SOME EXPERTS SAID  WHICH HAVE PROVEN IN THE PAST TO BE CAUTIOUS A GOVERNMENT CANNOT GO TO WAR  NO MATTER WHAT THE LAW SAYS  WITHOUT A NATIONAL CONSENSUS  SAID SHLOMO AVINERI  PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AT THE HEBREW UNIVERSITY OF JERUSALEM  OBVIOUSLY A PRIME MINISTER UNDER INVESTIGATION IS LIMITED BY THE KIND OF CHOICES HE CAN TAKE  AND THEY WILL BE SCRUTINIZED EVEN MORE THAN USUAL CRUCIALLY  THE SHOW OF FORCE IN SYRIA AND THE SHOW AND TELL OF SPYCRAFT BOTH COME AS IRAN IS CONSTRAINED FROM PLUNGING INTO A SHOOTING WAR WITH ISRAEL  EITHER BY ITSELF OR BY PROXY  ITS OWN PUBLIC IS INCREASINGLY RESTIVE  ITS CLOSE ALLY IN LEBANON  HEZBOLLAH  WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE BE COUNTED ON TO RETALIATE AGAINST ISRAEL  IS REINED IN  AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT  BY ELECTIONS ON MAY 6  IN WHICH IT IS FIELDING CANDIDATES MOST OF ALL  WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP SET TO ANNOUNCE HIS DECISION ON THE NUCLEAR AGREEMENT BY MAY 12  IRAN IS UNLIKELY TO GIVE MR  TRUMP ANY FRESH EXCUSES TO QUIT IT THATS JUST AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ISRAEL TO DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE  AND AT RELATIVELY LOW COST  SAID DANIEL SHAPIRO  THE FORMER UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL UNDER MR  OBAMA ANALYSTS SAID MR  NETANYAHUS FIGHT TO ARREST IRANS CONVENTIONAL ARMS BUILDUP IN SYRIA WAS LINKED NOT MERELY BY COINCIDENCE OF TIMING TO HIS EFFORTS TO DENY TEHRAN A NUCLEAR OPTION  JUST AS NORTH KOREA AMASSED A HUGE ARSENAL OF ARTILLERY TO THREATEN SEOUL WHILE IT WORKED TO DEVELOP NUCLEAR ARMS  MR  SHAPIRO SAID  IRAN IS SEEKING TO THREATEN ISRAELI TERRITORY  WITH DRONES AND PRECISION GUIDED MISSILES FROM WITHIN SYRIA  WHILE IT USES TIME AND NEGOTIATIONS AND DELAYS TO ADVANCE THEIR NUCLEAR AMBITIONS AMOS YADLIN  A FORMER CHIEF OF ISRAELS MILITARY INTELLIGENCE WHO NOW HEADS THE INSTITUTE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY STUDIES IN TEL AVIV  SAID IRANS NUCLEAR AND CONVENTIONAL THREATS WERE AIMED AT THE SAME GOAL  TO DESTROY ISRAEL MR  YADLIN SAID THE NUCLEAR DEAL HAD SUCCEEDED IN STOPPING IRAN FROM PURSUING NUCLEAR WEAPONS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS SO THEY BUILT A CONVENTIONAL FORCE AGAINST ISRAEL IN SYRIA  WITH BALLISTIC MISSILES  WITH PRECISE GUIDANCE  HE SAID  AND THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS THREAT TOWARDS ISRAEL TODAY IN 2018 IF MR  TRUMP WALKS AWAY FROM THE NUCLEAR AGREEMENT  MR  YADLIN SAID  DEPENDING ON IRANS RESPONSE IT COULD LEAD TO A MILITARY CLASH BETWEEN ISRAEL AND IRAN PERHAPS YEARS DOWN THE ROAD  BUT A CLASH IN THE NORTH CAN HAPPEN THIS WEEK  THIS MONTH  HE WARNED INCREASINGLY IN RECENT YEARS  MR  NETANYAHU HAS SPOKEN WITH ALMOST PROPHETIC FERVOR ABOUT STOPPING IRAN  YET FOR ALL OF HIS ASSERTIVE MOVES THIS WEEK  ANALYSTS SAID IT REMAINED UNCLEAR WHERE EXACTLY THEY WERE INTENDED TO LEAD  IN PARTICULAR  IF HE SUCCEEDS IN SCUTTLING THE NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN  THEN WHAT HE DIDNT GIVE US ISRAELIS ANY LOGICAL SCENARIO FOR WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER THE AMERICAN DECISION  MR  BARNEA SAID  HOW THE IRANIANS WILL BE LESS NUCLEAR AFTER IT  HOW CONFIDENT HE IS THAT THIS ACTION BY THE U S  WILL DETER IRAN AND NOT SPEED UP ITS NUCLEAR PROCESS  THIS IS SOMETHING HE NEVER ELABORATED ON  AND ITS TIME HE DOES IT THE HEIGHTENED TENSION WITH IRAN  ALONG WITH THE KNESSETS ENACTMENT OF THE LOWERED THRESHOLD TO DECLARING WAR  CAME AS A SURPRISE  MR  BARNEA SAID  SUDDENLY  THEYRE FACED WITH A BIG QUESTION MARK  WHERE ARE WE HEADING MAYBE  MR  BARNEA ADDED  HE FEELS HIS WAR HAS COME

AD PLACES THE PRESIDENT ONSCREEN WITHIN SECONDS  WHERE HE DECLARES OF THE CONGRESSMAN  HES BEEN BEHIND ME FROM DAY 1  AND ON SATURDAY  WHEN MR  TRUMP IS IN CLEVELAND PROMOTING DECEMBERS MAJOR TAX OVERHAUL  MR  RENACCI WILL BE RIGHT THERE WITH HIM AS HE TRIES TO UNSEAT SENATOR SHERROD BROWN  MR  RENACCI IS CLOAKING HIMSELF IN THE TRUMP AURA  HOPING THAT HE CAN REPLICATE THE SUCCESS THAT MR  TRUMP FOUND IN THIS STATE IN THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION  BUT IT IS A CLOAK THAT MAY REST UNCOMFORTABLY ON THE SHOULDERS OF AN AFFLUENT  SOFT SPOKEN BUSINESSMAN CUT FAR MORE FROM THE MOLD OF THE OLD REPUBLICAN PARTY THAN MR  TRUMPS NEW ONE AND IF MR  RENACCI CAN CLEAR THE HURDLE OF TUESDAYS REPUBLICAN SENATE PRIMARY HERE  HE WILL FACE ANOTHER  FAR HIGHER ONE IN MR  BROWN  A GRAVELLY VOICED POPULIST WHOSE LONGSTANDING SUPPORT FOR PROTECTIONIST TRADE POLICIES  INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING AND ENTITLEMENTS LIKE MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY IS MORE IN LINE WITH MR  TRUMP THAN THE JIM RENACCI WHO WAS ELECTED TO CONGRESS IN 2010 AS AN OLD LINE  SMALL GOVERNMENT CONSERVATIVE BUT AS MR  RENACCI SEES IT  AFTER HELPING TO SEND MR  TRUMP TO THE WHITE HOUSE  OHIO VOTERS NOW HAVE A CHANCE TO REMOVE ONE OF THE IMPEDIMENTS STANDING IN THE PRESIDENTS WAY BY DENYING MR  BROWN  A DEMOCRAT  FROM SERVING A THIRD TERM THE REASON WHY THE PRESIDENT ENDORSED ME AND ASKED ME TO RUN IS HE WANTS SOMEBODY WHO CAN HELP HIM GET HIS AGENDA DONE  NOT SOMEBODY WHOS GOING TO VOTE AGAINST HIM  MR  RENACCI SAID AS HE SAT IN A BOOTH AT A CHICKEN WING RESTAURANT HERE MR  RENACCI  WITH AN ESTIMATED NET WORTH OF AT LEAST  MILLION  ACCORDING TO ROLL CALL  HAS HAD A LONG AND VARIED BUSINESS CAREER  WITH INVOLVEMENT IN NURSING HOMES  HARLEY DAVIDSON DEALERSHIPS  A CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP AND PARTIAL OWNERSHIP OF AN

TO THE TRADITIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE REPUBLICAN VOTE BUSINESSMEN AND BUSINESSWOMEN HAVE DIFFERENT STYLES  HE CONCEDED  IM MORE THE QUIET STYLE ALL OF THAT MAKES HIS EMBRACE OF MR  TRUMP AN IMPERFECT FIT  FOR ONE THING  MR  TRUMP PLEDGED TO DRAIN THE SWAMP  AND MR  RENACCI  WHO WAS FIRST ELECTED TO THE HOUSE NEARLY EIGHT YEARS AGO  IS TESTING JUST HOW LONG SOMEONE CAN BE IN WASHINGTON BEFORE BECOMING PART OF WHAT MUST BE DRAINED IN FACT  NOT TOO LONG AGO  MR  RENACCI WANTED OUT OF CONGRESS ENTIRELY  HE HAD BEEN RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR  BUT HE SWITCHED TO THE SENATE RACE AFTER JOSH MANDEL  THE REPUBLICAN STATE TREASURER  DROPPED OUT OF THE CONTEST THIS IS A GUY THAT DOESNT WORK THE ROOM  SAID DAVID B  COHEN  A POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF AKRON  ITS UNCLEAR WHETHER HE REALLY ENJOYS WHAT HE DOES FOR A LIVING RIGHT NOW IN TUESDAYS PRIMARY  MR  RENACCI FACES COMPETITION FOR TRUMP VOTERS WHO MIGHT AGAIN BE DRAWN TO SOMEONE WHO PRESENTS HIMSELF AS AN INSURGENT  HIS MAIN OPPONENT IS MIKE GIBBONS  A WEALTHY INVESTMENT BANKER WHO SPEAKS ADMIRINGLY OF MR  TRUMPS AGENDA AND RAISED MONEY FOR HIM WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IM AN OUTSIDER  AND IM BLUNT  AND I TELL THE TRUTH  MR  GIBBONS SAID AT A RALLY OUTSIDE CINCINNATI ON THURSDAY  WHERE HE APPEARED WITH SENATOR RAND PAUL  REPUBLICAN OF KENTUCKY   THE ESTABLISHMENT IS ALL BEHIND THE OTHER GUY  MR  PAUL SAID OF MR  RENACCI  NOT MEANING IT AS A COMPLIMENT IN AN INTERVIEW  MR  GIBBONS SAID MR  RENACCI SIMPLY DID NOT CONNECT WITH PEOPLE AND COULD NOT BEAT MR  BROWN  AT THE RALLY  HE WAS UNSPARING  ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I HAVE GOING FOR ME IS WHEN JIM RENACCI SPEAKS TO A GROUP  I GET MORE VOTES  HE SAID TO LAUGHS  ID LIKE TO INCREASE HIS SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS ANOTHER COMPLICATION IS THE ISSUE OF TRADE MR  BROWN VOTED AGAINST THE NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT AS A HOUSE MEMBER AND EVEN WROTE A BOOK CALLED MYTHS OF FREE TRADE  WHEN MR  TRUMP IMPOSED TARIFFS ON IMPORTED STEEL AND ALUMINUM THIS YEAR  MR  BROWN CHEERED HIM ON MR  RENACCI  BY CONTRAST  HAS VOTED FOR TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH SOUTH KOREA  COLOMBIA AND PANAMA  AND HE ALSO SUPPORTED GIVING PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA ENHANCED TRADE NEGOTIATING POWER THE TRADE ISSUE HAS BEEN DIFFICULT FOR RENACCI BECAUSE HE IS REALLY YOUR TYPICAL BIG BUSINESS REPUBLICAN  PROFESSOR COHEN SAID  TRUMPS MORE POPULIST TONE ON ISSUES LIKE TRADE DOVETAILS REALLY WELL WITH SHERROD BROWNS POSITION ON TRADE AND OTHER POPULIST ISSUES THAT BROWN HAS BEEN ADVOCATING FOR DECADES ASKED ABOUT TRADE  MR  RENACCI STRUGGLED  HE SUGGESTED THAT MR  BROWN WAS FOCUSED ON PROTECTING STEELWORKERS AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER INDUSTRIES  LIKE FARMING AND MANUFACTURING  PRECISELY THE CRITICISM LEVELED AT MR  TRUMP  HE THEN SUGGESTED THAT THE PRESIDENT IS COMING AROUND TO HIS VIEWS WHAT HES DOING IS HES LISTENING  LEARNING AND THEN HES GOING TO LEAD  SO IN THE END I THINK THE TARIFF POLICIES AND PROGRAMS WILL CHANGE  MR  RENACCI SAID OF MR  TRUMP  IN THE END  HELL GET CLOSER TO WHAT OHIO NEEDS MR  RENACCIS EMBRACE OF MR  TRUMP CARRIES AN OBVIOUS DANGER  TURNING OFF VOTERS WHO SEE A RISK THAT HE WOULD SIMPLY BE A RUBBER STAMP OUR PRESIDENTS GREAT  BUT HES NOT ALWAYS RIGHT  SAID CAROLYN ROBEY WARREN  THE PRESIDENT OF OHIO CARRY  A GUN RIGHTS GROUP THAT ENDORSED MR  GIBBONS  SHE BROUGHT UP AN EPISODE THIS YEAR WHEN MR  TRUMP MET WITH LAWMAKERS AFTER THE SCHOOL SHOOTING IN PARKLAND  FLA WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME OUT AND SAID  TAKE THE GUNS FIRST  WELL WORRY ABOUT DUE PROCESS LATER  WE WANT THE GUY THATS GOING TO SAY  HOLD ON NOW  SHE SAID  AND WERE AFRAID JIM RENACCI WILL SAY  YES  SIR MR  BROWN IS ONE OF 10 DEMOCRATIC SENATORS WHO ARE RUNNING IN NOVEMBER IN STATES WON BY MR  TRUMP  THOUGH THE OHIO RACE IS NOT GENERALLY SEEN AS ONE OF THE DEMOCRATS MOST IMPERILED SEATS IN A WESTERN OHIO COUNTY ALONG THE INDIANA BORDER THAT MR  TRUMP WON WITH 80 PERCENT OF THE VOTE  MR  RENACCI PREVIEWED IN AN INTERVIEW HOW HE PLANNED TO TURN VOTERS AGAINST MR  BROWN  HE DESCRIBED THE SENATOR AS A CAREER POLITICIAN AND SOMEONE FAR TOO LIBERAL FOR THE STATE THAT HE REPRESENTS IVE SAID ALL ALONG SHERROD PROBABLY COULD REPRESENT MASSACHUSETTS VERY WELL  HE SAID  PROBABLY REPRESENT NEW YORK  MAYBE  MAYBE EVEN CALIFORNIA  BUT HIS VOTES DONT REPRESENT OHIO PRESTON MADDOCK  A SPOKESMAN FOR THE BROWN CAMPAIGN  RESPONDED  WHILE CONGRESSMAN RENACCI FINDS NEW WAYS TO HELP HIMSELF GET AHEAD  SHERROD IS FIGHTING FOR OHIOANS EVERY DAY  INCLUDING WORKING WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION AND HIS REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE WHEN ITS BEST FOR OHIO WORKERS AND THEN THERE IS MR  RENACCIS BEARHUG EMBRACE OF MR  TRUMP  RIGHT DOWN TO HIS TWITTER RANTS THE ONE THING I HEAR A LOT IS  I LOVE THE PRESIDENT  I JUST WISH HE WOULDNT TWEET AS MUCH  HE SAID  AND MY ANSWER IS  IF YOU LOVE THE PRESIDENT  YOU GOT TO LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM  INCLUDING THAT
20180502,politics,politics,1,ONE LESSON TO BE DRAWN FROM RECENT WESTERN HISTORY MIGHT BE THIS  SOMETIMES THE EXTREMISTS AND RADICALS AND WEIRDOS SEE THE WORLD MORE CLEARLY THAN THE RESPECTABLE AND MODERATE AND SANE  ALL KINDS OF PHENOMENA  STARTING AS FAR BACK AS THE IRAQ WAR AND THE CRISIS OF THE EURO BUT ACCELERATING IN THE AGE OF POPULISM  HAVE MADE MORE SENSE IN THE LIGHT OF ANALYSIS BY REACTIONARIES AND RADICALS THAN AS PORTRAYED IN THE ORGANS OF ESTABLISHMENT OPINION THIS IS PART OF WHY THERES BEEN SO MUCH RECENT AGITATION OVER UNIVERSITIES AND OP ED PAGES AND OTHER FORUMS FOR DEBATE  THERES A GENERAL UNDERSTANDING THAT THE IDEOLOGICAL MAINSTREAM ISNT ADEQUATE TO THE MOMENT  BUT NOBODY CAN DECIDE WHETHER THAT MEANS WE NEED PURGES OR PLURALISM  A SPIRIT OF CURIOSITY AND CONVERSATION OR A FURIOUS WAR AGAINST WHICHEVER SIDE YOU THINK IS EVIL FOR THOSE MORE CURIOUS THAN MARTIAL  ONE USEFUL PATH THROUGH THIS THICKET IS TO LOOK AT AREAS WHERE EXTREMISTS AND ECCENTRICS FROM VERY DIFFERENT WORLDS ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME SUBJECT  SUCH OVERLAP IS NO GUARANTEE OF WISDOM  BUT ITS OFTEN A SIGN THAT THERES SOMETHING INTERESTING GOING ON WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE SEX ROBOTS WELL  ACTUALLY  FIRST IT BRINGS ME TO THE CASE OF ROBIN HANSON  A GEORGE MASON ECONOMIST  LIBERTARIAN AND NOTED BRILLIANT WEIRDO  COMMENTING ON THE RECENT TERRORIST VIOLENCE IN TORONTO  IN WHICH A SELF IDENTIFIED INCEL  THAT IS  INVOLUNTARY CELIBATE  MAN SOUGHT RETRIBUTION AGAINST WOMEN AND SOCIETY FOR DENYING HIM THE FORNICATION HE FELT THAT HE DESERVED  HANSON OFFERED THIS PROVOCATION  IF WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE JUST DISTRIBUTION OF PROPERTY AND MONEY  WHY DO WE ASSUME THAT THE DESIRE FOR SOME SORT OF SEXUAL REDISTRIBUTION IS INHERENTLY RIDICULOUS AFTER ALL  HE WROTE  ONE MIGHT PLAUSIBLY ARGUE THAT THOSE WITH MUCH LESS ACCESS TO SEX SUFFER TO A SIMILAR DEGREE AS THOSE WITH LOW INCOME  AND MIGHT SIMILARLY HOPE TO GAIN FROM ORGANIZING AROUND THIS IDENTITY  TO LOBBY FOR REDISTRIBUTION ALONG THIS AXIS AND TO AT LEAST IMPLICITLY THREATEN VIOLENCE IF THEIR DEMANDS ARE NOT MET THIS ARGUMENT WAS NOT WELL RECEIVED BY PEOPLE CLOSER TO THE MAINSTREAM THAN PROFESSOR HANSON  TO PUT IT MILDLY  A REPRESENTATIVE RESPONSE FROM SLATES JORDAN WEISSMANN  IS ROBIN HANSON THE CREEPIEST ECONOMIST IN AMERICA  CITED THE POST ALONG WITH SOME PREVIOUS CREEPY FORAYS TO DISMISS HANSON AS A MISOGYNIST WEIRDO NOT THAT FAR REMOVED FROM THE FRANKER MISOGYNY OF TOXIC ONLINE MALES BUT HANSONS POST MADE ME IMMEDIATELY THINK OF A RECENT ESSAY IN THE LONDON REVIEW OF BOOKS BY AMIA SRINIVASAN  DOES ANYONE HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEX  SRINIVASAN  AN OXFORD PHILOSOPHY PROFESSOR  COVERED SIMILAR GROUND  STARTING WITH AN EARLIER INCEL KILLER  BUT EXPANDED THE ARGUMENT WELL BEYOND THE REALM OF MALE CHAUVINISTS TO CONSIDER GROUPS WITH WHOM THE LONDON REVIEWS LEFT LEANING AND FEMINIST READERS WOULD HAVE MORE NATURAL SYMPATHY  THE OVERWEIGHT AND DISABLED  MINORITY GROUPS TREATED AS UNATTRACTIVE BY THE MAJORITY  TRANS WOMEN UNABLE TO FIND PARTNERS AND OTHER VICTIMS  IN HER NARRATIVE  OF A SOCIETY THAT STILL MAKES US PRISONERS OF PATRIARCHAL AND ALSO RACIST SEXIST HOMOPHOBIC RULES OF SEXUAL DESIRE SRINIVASAN ULTIMATELY ANSWERED HER TITLE QUESTION IN THE NEGATIVE  THERE IS NO ENTITLEMENT TO SEX  AND EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO WANT WHAT THEY WANT  BUT HER NEGATIVE ANSWER WAS A QUALIFIED ONE  WHILE NO ONE HAS A RIGHT TO BE DESIRED  AT THE SAME TIME WHO IS DESIRED AND WHO ISNT IS A POLITICAL QUESTION  WHICH LEFT WING AND FEMINIST POLITICS MIGHT HELP SOCIETY ANSWER DIFFERENTLY SOMEDAY  THIS WOULDNT INSTANTIATE A FORMAL RIGHT TO SEX  EXACTLY  BUT IF THE NEW ORDER WORKED AS ITS REVOLUTIONARY ARCHITECTS INTENDED  SEX WOULD BE MORE JUSTLY DISTRIBUTED THAN IT IS TODAY A NUMBER OF THE CRITICS I SAW ENGAGING WITH SRINIVASANS ESSAY TENDED TO RESPOND THE WAY A NORMAL CENTER LEFT WRITER LIKE WEISSMANN ENGAGED WITH HANSONS THOUGHT EXPERIMENT  BY COMMENTING ON ITS WEIRDNESS OR IDEOLOGICAL EXTREMITY RATHER THAN ENGAGING FULLY WITH ITS SUBSTANCE  BUT TO ME  READING HANSON AND SRINIVASAN TOGETHER OFFERS A GOOD CASE STUDY IN HOW INTELLECTUAL ECCENTRICS  LIKE SOCIALISTS AND POPULISTS IN POLITICS  CAN SURFACE ISSUES AND PROBLEMS THAT LURK BENEATH THE SURFACE OF MORE MAINSTREAM DEBATES BY THIS I MEAN THAT AS OFFENSIVE OR UTOPIAN THE REDISTRIBUTION OF SEX MIGHT SOUND  THE IDEA IS ENTIRELY RESPONSIVE TO THE LOGIC OF LATE MODERN SEXUAL LIFE  AND ITS PURSUIT WOULD BE ENTIRELY CHARACTERISTIC OF A RECURRING PATTERN IN LIBERAL SOCIETIES FIRST  BECAUSE LIKE OTHER FORMS OF NEOLIBERAL DEREGULATION THE SEXUAL REVOLUTION CREATED NEW WINNERS AND LOSERS  NEW HIERARCHIES TO REPLACE THE OLD ONES  PRIVILEGING THE BEAUTIFUL AND RICH AND SOCIALLY ADEPT IN NEW WAYS AND RELEGATING OTHERS TO NEW FORMS OF LONELINESS AND FRUSTRATION SECOND  BECAUSE IN THIS NEW LANDSCAPE  AND AMID OTHER ECONOMIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATIONS  THE SEXES SEEM TO BE STRUGGLING GENERALLY TO RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER  WITH SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CHASMS OPENING BETWEEN THEM AND NOT ONLY MARRIAGE AND FAMILY BUT ALSO SEXUAL ACTIVITY ITSELF IN RECENT DECLINE THIRD  BECAUSE THE CULTURES DOMINANT MESSAGE ABOUT SEX IS STILL ESSENTIALLY HEFNERIAN  DESPITE CERTAIN REVISIONS ATTEMPTED BY FEMINISTS SINCE THE HEYDAY OF THE PLAYBOY PHILOSOPHY  A MESSAGE THAT FREQUENCY AND VARIETY IN SEXUAL EXPERIENCE IS AS CLOSE TO A SUMMUM BONUM AS THE HUMAN CONDITION HAS TO OFFER  THAT THE GREATEST POSSIBLE DIVERSITY IN SEXUAL DESIRES AND TASTES AND IDENTITIES SHOULD BE NOT ONLY ACCEPTED BUT CULTIVATED  AND THAT VIRGINITY AND CELIBACY ARE AT BEST STRANGE AND AT WORST PITIABLE STATES  AND THIS MASTER NARRATIVE  INEVITABLY  MAKES BOTH THE NEW INEQUALITIES AND THE DECLINE OF ACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO BEAR  WHICH IN TURN ENCOURAGES PEOPLE  AS EVER UNDER MODERNITY  TO PLACE THEIR HOPE FOR ESCAPE FROM THE COSTS OF ONE REVOLUTION IN A FURTHER ONE YET TO COME  BE IT POLITICAL  SOCIAL OR TECHNOLOGICAL  WHICH WILL SUPPLY IF NOT THE PROMISED UTOPIA AT LEAST SOME FORM OF REDRESS FOR THE MANY PEOPLE THAT PROGRESS HAS OBVIOUSLY LEFT BEHIND THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE  CONSERVATIVE RESPONSE  OF COURSE  NAMELY  THAT OUR WIDESPREAD ISOLATION AND UNHAPPINESS AND STERILITY MIGHT BE DEALT WITH BY REVIVING OR ADAPTING OLDER IDEAS ABOUT THE VIRTUES OF MONOGAMY AND CHASTITY AND PERMANENCE AND THE SPECIAL RESPECT OWED TO THE CELIBATE BUT THIS IS NOT THE NATURAL RESPONSE FOR A SOCIETY LIKE OURS  INSTEAD WE TEND TO LOOK FOR FIXES THAT SEEM TO BUILD ON PREVIOUS REVOLUTIONS  RATHER THAN REVERSE THEM IN THE CASE OF SEXUAL LIBERATION AND ITS DISCONTENTS  THATS UNLIKELY TO MEAN THE KIND OF THOROUGHGOINGLY UTOPIAN REIMAGINING OF SEXUAL DESIRE THAT WRITERS LIKE SRINIVASAN THINK WE SHOULD ASPIRE TOWARD  OR ANYTHING QUITE SO FORMAL AS THE PRO REDISTRIBUTION POLITICAL LOBBY OF HANSONS THOUGHT EXPERIMENT BUT I EXPECT THE LOGIC OF COMMERCE AND TECHNOLOGY WILL BE CONSCIOUSLY HARNESSED  AS ALREADY IN PORNOGRAPHY  TO ADDRESS THE UNHAPPINESS OF INCELS  BE THEY ANGRY AND DANGEROUS OR SIMPLY DEPRESSED AND DESPAIRING  THE LEFTS INCREASING ZEAL TO TRANSFORM PROSTITUTION INTO LEGALIZED AND REGULATED SEX WORK WILL HAVE THIS END IMPLICITLY IN MIND  THE LIBERTARIAN  AND GENERAL MALE  FASCINATION WITH VIRTUAL REALITY PORN AND SEX ROBOTS WILL INCREASE AS THOSE TECHNOLOGIES IMPROVE  AND AT A CERTAIN POINT  WITHOUT ANYONE FORMALLY DEBATING THE IDEA OF A RIGHT TO SEX  RIGHT THINKING PEOPLE WILL SIMPLY COME TO AGREE THAT SOME SUCH RIGHT EXISTS  AND THAT IT MAKES SENSE TO LOOK TO SOME COMBINATION OF CHANGED LAWS  NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND EVOLVED MORES TO FULFILL IT WHETHER SEX WORKERS AND SEX ROBOTS CAN ACTUALLY DELIVER REAL FULFILLMENT IS ANOTHER MATTER  BUT THAT THEY WILL EVENTUALLY BE ASKED TO DO IT  IN SERVICE TO A REDISTRIBUTIVE GOAL THAT FOR NOW STILL SEEMS CREEPY OR MISOGYNIST OR RADICAL  FEELS PRETTY MUCH INEVITABLE

20180501,business,market,4,FEDERAL AUTHORITIES SAID ON TUESDAY THEY WERE ISSUING 13 WARNING LETTERS TO COMPANIES THAT SELL VAPING PRODUCTS LIKE LIQUID NICOTINE IN PACKAGING THAT MAY APPEAL TO CHILDREN  INCLUDING PRODUCTS THAT RESEMBLE JUICE BOXES AND CANDY THE JOINT ACTION BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AND THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION IS THE LATEST STEP BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CRACK DOWN ON THE VAPING INDUSTRY  PARTICULARLY ON DEVICES THAT ARE POPULAR WITH TEENAGERS LAST WEEK   F D A  OFFICIALS SAID THEY HAD STARTED AN UNDERCOVER STING OPERATION TARGETING RETAILERS THAT SELL THE POPULAR JUUL PRODUCTS TO MINORS AND HAD ASKED THE MAKER  JUUL LABS  TO TURN OVER DOCUMENTS RELATED TO MARKETING PRACTICES AND HEALTH RESEARCH THE ACTION ON TUESDAY  AGAINST A GROUP OF MANUFACTURERS  DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAILERS  FOCUSED ON PRODUCTS THAT THE AGENCIES SAID WERE AIMED AT UNDERAGE USERS OR COULD BE ACCIDENTALLY INGESTED BY CHILDREN  THE PRODUCTS  SOLD THROUGH MULTIPLE ONLINE RETAILERS  HAVE NAMES LIKE ONE MAD HIT JUICE BOX  SOLD BY NEWHERE INC  AND VAPE HEADS SOUR SMURF SAUCE  SOLD BY LIFTED LIQUIDS  WHICH LOOK LIKE WARHEADS CANDY ONE PRODUCT  THE TWIRLY POP  SOLD BY OMNIA E LIQUID  ALSO CAME WITH A REAL LOLLIPOP  FEDERAL OFFICIALS SAID SOME OF THE COMPANIES ALSO SOLD PRODUCTS TO MINORS  FEDERAL OFFICIALS SAID EVEN IF THE PRODUCTS WERE NOT SOLD TO MINORS  A CHILD COULD BE MISTAKENLY POISONED BECAUSE THE PACKAGING SO CLOSELY RESEMBLED FOOD AND CANDY THE IMAGES ARE ALARMING  AND ITS EASY TO SEE HOW A CHILD COULD CONFUSE THESE E LIQUID PRODUCTS FOR SOMETHING THEY BELIEVE THEYVE CONSUMED BEFORE  DR  SCOTT GOTTLIEB  THE F D A  COMMISSIONER  SAID IN A TELEPHONE CALL WITH REPORTERS ON TUESDAY CHILD POISONINGS FROM INGESTING LIQUID NICOTINE HAVE RECENTLY INCREASED  SUCH POISONINGS CAN BE DEADLY AND CAN CAUSE SEIZURES  COMAS AND RESPIRATORY ARREST  THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THE PRODUCTS UNDER SCRUTINY THIS WEEK CAUSED ANY CHILD DEATHS  OFFICIALS SAID NEVERTHELESS  IT TAKES A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF THESE E LIQUIDS  IN SOME CASES LESS THAN HALF A TEASPOON  TO BE AT THE LOW END OF WHAT COULD BE A FATAL EFFECT FOR A KID  AND EVEN LESS THAN THAT TO MAKE THEM VERY  VERY SICK  SAID MITCH ZELLER  THE DIRECTOR OF THE F D A S CENTER FOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS SOME OF THE PRODUCTS EVEN SMELLED LIKE THE FOOD THEY WERE IMITATING  SAID MAUREEN K  OHLHAUSEN  THE ACTING CHAIRWOMAN OF THE F T C  THE APPLE JUICE PRODUCT CAME IN A CARDBOARD BOX  WITH THE CORNERS SEALED AND FOLDED OVER JUST LIKE THE SHELF STABLE BOXES SOLD IN SUPERMARKETS  ACCORDING TO THE WARNING LETTER  IT ALSO SMELLED LIKE APPLE JUICE  EVEN WITHOUT OPENING THE PACKAGE THESE COMPANIES ARE MARKETING THEIR E LIQUIDS IN A MANNER THAT THE PRODUCT PARTICULARLY APPEALING TO YOUNG CHILDREN  SHE SAID NICK WARRENDER  THE OWNER OF LIFTED LIQUIDS  SAID HE REMOVED THE VAPE HEADS PRODUCT FROM HIS INVENTORY AND REDESIGNED THE PACKAGING ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO TO ADDRESS OFFICIALS CONCERNS OVER MARKETING SUCH PRODUCTS  IT WAS SOMETHING WE ALREADY SAW AS A PROBLEM  HE SAID HE SAID THAT THE PRODUCTS WERE NEVER MARKETED TO CHILDREN  BUT WERE DESIGNED TO APPEAL TO ADULTS NOSTALGIA  OUR GOAL IS COMPLETE COMPLIANCE WITH THE F D A  AND THE F T C  HE SAID  BUT ADDED THAT HE ALSO WANTED TO CREATE PRODUCTS THAT WILL BE ATTRACTIVE TO CONSUMERS OUR GOAL IS ALSO TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS THAT ARE GOING TO GIVE ADULT SMOKERS THE ABILITY TO GET AWAY FROM CIGARETTES AND ALSO SOMETHING THEY ARE GOING TO ENJOY MR  WARRENDER SAID HIS PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN CHILDPROOF PACKAGING AND THAT ANY ONLINE SALES GO THROUGH A RIGOROUS VETTING SYSTEM JAMESON RODGERS  VICE PRESIDENT OF BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AT NEWHERE  INC  SAID THE COMPANY STOPPED MANUFACTURING AND SHIPPING THE APPLE JUICE PRODUCT MONTHS AGO  AFTER DECIDING IN EARLY 2017 THAT IT WAS A WAY TO BE PROACTIVELY RESPONSIBLE  MR  RODGERS SAID THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE SOME RETAILERS WERE CONTINUING TO SELL REMAINING INVENTORY OF THE PRODUCT EVEN THOUGH HIS COMPANY HAD STOPPED MAKING OR SHIPPING IT OTHER COMPANIES COULD NOT BE REACHED IMMEDIATELY FOR COMMENT  F D A  OFFICIALS SAID ALL OF THE COMPANIES SENT WARNING LETTERS ON TUESDAY HAD RECENTLY SOLD THE PRODUCTS LAST SUMMER  DR  GOTTLIEB ISSUED A REPRIEVE TO MANUFACTURERS OF ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES BY DELAYING REGULATIONS THAT COULD HAVE REMOVED MANY OF THEIR PRODUCTS FROM THE MARKET  WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ANNOUNCING AN INITIATIVE THAT WILL PUSH TOBACCO CIGARETTE MAKERS TO REDUCE THE LEVELS OF NICOTINE IN THEIR PRODUCTS DR  GOTTLIEB SAID THE ACTION ON TUESDAY  AS WELL AS THE CRACKDOWN LAST WEEK ON THE JUUL PRODUCTS  WERE PART OF A LONGER TERM CAMPAIGN AIMED AT REDUCING THE USE OF VAPING PRODUCTS BY MINORS WHILE HE SAID THERE IS VALUE IN ENCOURAGING THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVES THAT COULD LURE SMOKERS AWAY FROM HARMFUL CIGARETTES  PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS NEEDED TO BE VIGILANT ABOUT NOT ADDICTING A NEW GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE TO VAPING PRODUCTS THESE ARE JUST THE INITIAL STEPS IN WHAT IS GOING TO BE A SUSTAINED CAMPAIGN  DR  GOTTLIEB SAID  THERE ARE BAD ACTORS OUT THERE

CHANGING  IN SOME WAYS DRASTICALLY  AND MANY RESIDENTS THINK THE COMMUNITY IS NEARING ANOTHER INFLECTION POINT  SOME OF THE STRONGEST TIES THAT ONCE BOUND PEOPLE TOGETHER HERE  PARTICULARLY THE RELIANCE ON A SHARED LANGUAGE AND RELIGION  ARE BEGINNING TO FRAY WITHIN THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS  MANY OF WHOM ARE NO LONGER FLUENT IN VIETNAMESE AND  FOLLOWING A GENERAL TREND  ARE LESS INVESTED IN THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH  GREATER ACCESS TO EDUCATION  AND THE SUBSEQUENT JOB PROSPECTS THAT SUCH ACCESS PROVIDES  ARE ALSO DRIVING YOUNGER VIETNAMESE AMERICANS INCREASINGLY FARTHER FROM NEW ORLEANS EAST  ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF A DEARTH OF LOCAL ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY COLLECTIVELY  THESE CHANGES RAISE BROAD QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LIFE SPAN OF CONCENTRATED IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE UNITED STATES  AND ABOUT THE SEEMINGLY OPPOSING AIMS OF MAINTAINING RICH CULTURAL PRACTICES  OFTEN KINDLED BY FORMS OF ISOLATION  AND PROVIDING FOR GREATER DEGREES OF ENGAGEMENT AND INTEGRATION  ITS SOMETHING WERE ALL THINKING ABOUT  SAID LANG LE  WHO IS 49 AND SETTLED HERE WITH HER FAMILY AS A VIETNAMESE REFUGEE IN 1975  MY GENERATION  WERE MOSTLY STILL HERE  BUT THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS ARE MOVING OUT  THEYRE

VILLAGE DE LEST IS STILL HOME TO A VIBRANT ARRAY OF VIETNAMESE TRADITIONS  MANY OF WHICH REVOLVE AROUND THREE CULTURAL PILLARS  RELIGION  FAMILY AND FOOD ITS HARD TO OVERSTATE THE CENTRALITY OF RELIGIOUS LIFE  AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE VIETNAMESE COMMUNITY HERE IS ROMAN CATHOLIC  AND THE LOCAL CHURCH  MARY QUEEN OF VIETNAM  SERVES THE RESIDENTS IN WAYS THAT EXTEND FAR BEYOND THE

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS  INCLUDING THOSE TIED TO HEALTH CARE  EDUCATION  HOUSING  SOCIAL SERVICES AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AMONG MQVNS SUCCESSFUL VENTURES WAS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A FARMING COOPERATIVE

 HE SAID  NOBODY COMES AROUND ASKING TO RENT ANYMORE THERES BIGGER ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY ELSEWHERE  HE SAID  ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE SOME OF THE SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSES TO HAVE SPRUNG FROM VILLAGE DE LEST ARE THOSE THAT HAVE INTEGRATED MORE BROADLY INTO GREATER NEW ORLEANS  DONG PHUONG BAKERY  FOR EXAMPLE  WHICH SUPPLIES MANY RESTAURANTS IN THE CITY WITH BREAD FOR BANH MI SANDWICHES  HAS GAINED NATIONAL ATTENTION FOR ITS BAKED GOODS  MOST RECENTLY AS A WINNER OF A 2018 JAMES BEARD FOUNDATION AMERICAS CLASSICS AWARD MORE GENERALLY  THE PROLIFERATION OF PHO AND BANH MI RESTAURANTS THROUGHOUT THE CITY  SEVERAL RESIDENTS POINTED OUT  IS PROOF OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF VIETNAMESE CULTURE ARE BEING INTEGRATED AND ASSIMILATED INTO GREATER NEW ORLEANS   AS IS OFTEN CITED  LOUISIANA AND VIETNAM ARE BOTH ONETIME COLONIES OF FRANCE  AND FRENCH INFLUENCES ABOUND IN BOTH CULINARY CULTURES  THE PO BOY AND BANH MI  FOR EXAMPLE  SHARE A COMMON ANCESTOR IN THE BAGUETTE  LOCALLY  BANH MI IS SOMETIMES MARKETED AS THE VIETNAMESE PO BOY BUT EVEN IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY  THE ROLE OF FAMILY CAN BE A POWERFUL FORM OF INSPIRATION  AS IS EXEMPLIFIED BY NAMESE  A VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT IN THE MID CITY NEIGHBORHOOD  BUILT AT THE SAME LOCATION AS A CORNER CONVENIENCE STORE RUN BY SOI TRAN  WHO SETTLED IN VILLAGE DE LEST AS A REFUGEE IN 1975  NAMESE IS NOW OWNED AND RUN BY MS  TRANS

RESIDENTS OFFERED A RANGE OF RESPONSES SOME  LIKE AARON TRUONG  DOUBT THE COMMUNITY WILL LAST ANOTHER GENERATION  DOWN THE ROAD  20 YEARS FROM NOW  YOURE NOT GOING TO SEE A WHOLE LOT BACK HERE ANYMORE  HE SAID  THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO END UP SPREAD ELSEWHERE CYNDI NGUYEN  THE COUNCILWOMAN ELECT  ALSO THINKS THE COMMUNITY HERE MAY DIMINISH  THOUGH SHE INTERPRETS IT MORE POSITIVELY  WE MAY SPREAD OUT INTO OTHER PARTS OF NEW ORLEANS  SHE SAID  BUT IN A WAY I THINK THATS GOOD THING  THAT SHOULD BE A VICTORY FOR US WE DIDNT COME OVER HERE JUST TO STAY BY OURSELVES  SHE ADDED  NO MATTER WHERE I LIVE  AS A VIETNAMESE AMERICAN PERSON  IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP UP THE TRADITIONS AND THE CULTURE  I DONT HAVE TO LIVE NEXT DOOR TO A VIETNAMESE PERSON TO FEEL LIKE WE HAVE KEPT MY CULTURE INTACT SURPRISINGLY  SOME OF THE MOST OPTIMISTIC RESPONSES ABOUT THE COMMUNITYS CONTINUED SURVIVAL COME FROM THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS  TUAN NGUYEN  THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF MQVN  WHO IS 37 AND GREW UP IN VILLAGE DE LEST  ACKNOWLEDGED THAT  EVEN THOUGH MANY OF HIS PEERS HAD LEFT  THE COMMUNITY AND ITS CULTURE HAD A WAY OF DRAWING PEOPLE BACK WE MAY NOT BECOME FARMERS OR FISHERMEN  BUT WE DO ROTATE BACK

20180503,business,business,8,WASHINGTON  FPI MANAGEMENT  A PROPERTY COMPANY IN CALIFORNIA  WANTS TO HIRE DOZENS OF PEOPLE  FACTORIES FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE TO MICHIGAN NEED WORKERS  HOTELS IN LAS VEGAS ARE DESPERATE TO FILL JOBS THOSE EMPLOYERS AND MANY OTHERS ARE QUIETLY TAKING WHAT ONCE WOULD HAVE BEEN A RADICAL STEP  THEY RE DROPPING MARIJUANA FROM THE DRUG TESTS THEY REQUIRE OF PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES  MARIJUANA TESTING  A FIXTURE AT LARGE AMERICAN EMPLOYERS FOR AT LEAST 30 YEARS  EXCLUDES TOO MANY POTENTIAL WORKERS  EXPERTS SAY  AT A TIME WHEN FILLING JOBS IS MORE CHALLENGING THAN IT S BEEN IN NEARLY TWO DECADES IT HAS COME OUT OF NOWHERE  SAID MICHAEL CLARKSON  HEAD OF THE DRUG TESTING PRACTICE AT OGLETREE DEAKINS  A LAW FIRM   I HAVE HEARD FROM LOTS OF CLIENTS THINGS LIKE   I CAN T STAFF THE THIRD SHIFT AND TEST FOR MARIJUANA  THOUGH STILL IN ITS EARLY STAGES  THE SHIFT AWAY FROM MARIJUANA TESTING APPEARS LIKELY TO ACCELERATE  MORE STATES ARE LEGALIZING CANNABIS FOR RECREATIONAL USE  MICHIGAN COULD BECOME THE 10TH STATE TO DO SO IN NOVEMBER  MISSOURI APPEARS ON TRACK TO BECOME THE 30TH STATE TO ALLOW MEDICAL POT USE AND MEDICAL MARIJUANA USERS IN MASSACHUSETTS   CONNECTICUT AND RHODE ISLAND HAVE WON LAWSUITS IN THE PAST YEAR AGAINST COMPANIES THAT RESCINDED JOB OFFERS OR FIRED WORKERS BECAUSE OF POSITIVE TESTS FOR CANNABIS  BEFORE LAST YEAR  COURTS HAD ALWAYS RULED IN FAVOR OF EMPLOYERS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ALSO MAY BE SOFTENING ITS RESISTANCE TO LEGAL MARIJUANA  LABOR SECRETARY ALEXANDER ACOSTA SUGGESTED AT A CONGRESSIONAL HEARING LAST MONTH THAT EMPLOYERS SHOULD TAKE A  STEP BACK  ON DRUG TESTING WE HAVE ALL THESE AMERICANS THAT ARE LOOKING TO WORK  ACOSTA SAID   ARE WE ALIGNING OUR   DRUG TESTING POLICIES WITH WHAT S RIGHT FOR THE WORKFORCE THERE IS NO DEFINITIVE DATA ON HOW MANY COMPANIES CONDUCT DRUG TESTS  THOUGH THE SOCIETY FOR HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT FOUND IN A SURVEY THAT 57 PERCENT DO SO  NOR IS THERE ANY RECENT DATA ON HOW MANY HAVE DROPPED MARIJUANA FROM MANDATORY DRUG TESTING BUT INTERVIEWS WITH HIRING EXECUTIVES  EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS AND AGENCIES THAT HELP EMPLOYERS FILL JOBS INDICATE THAT DROPPING MARIJUANA TESTING IS AMONG THE STEPS MORE COMPANIES ARE TAKING TO EXPAND THEIR POOL OF APPLICANTS TO FILL A NEAR RECORD LEVEL OF OPENINGS BUSINESSES ARE HIRING MORE PEOPLE WITHOUT HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS  FOR EXAMPLE  TO THE POINT WHERE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR NON HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES HAS SUNK MORE THAN A FULL PERCENTAGE POINT IN THE PAST YEAR TO 5 5 PERCENT  THAT S THE STEEPEST SUCH DROP FOR ANY EDUCATIONAL GROUP OVER THAT TIME  ON FRIDAY  THE GOVERNMENT IS EXPECTED TO REPORT ANOTHER ROBUST JOBS REPORT FOR APRIL EXCLUDING MARIJUANA FROM TESTING MARKS THE FIRST MAJOR SHIFT IN WORKPLACE DRUG POLICIES SINCE EMPLOYERS BEGAN REGULARLY SCREENING APPLICANTS IN THE LATE 1980S  THEY DID SO AFTER A FEDERAL LAW REQUIRED THAT GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS MAINTAIN DRUG FREE WORKPLACES  MANY PRIVATE BUSINESSES ADOPTED THEIR OWN MANDATORY DRUG TESTING OF APPLICANTS MOST BUSINESSES THAT HAVE DROPPED MARIJUANA TESTS CONTINUE TO SCREEN FOR COCAINE  OPIATES  HEROIN AND OTHER DRUGS  BUT JAMES REIDY  AN EMPLOYMENT LAWYER IN NEW HAMPSHIRE  SAYS COMPANIES ARE THINKING HARDER ABOUT THE TYPES OF JOBS THAT SHOULD REALISTICALLY REQUIRE MARIJUANA TESTS  IF A MANUFACTURING WORKER  FOR INSTANCE  ISN T DRIVING A FORKLIFT OR OPERATING INDUSTRIAL MACHINERY  EMPLOYERS MAY DEEM A MARIJUANA TEST UNNECESSARY EMPLOYERS ARE SAYING   WE HAVE A THIN LABOR POOL    REIDY SAID     SO ARE WE GOING TO TEST AND EXCLUDE A WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE  OR CAN WE ASSUME SOME RISKS  AS LONG AS THEY RE NOT IMPAIRED AT WORK  YET MANY COMPANIES ARE RELUCTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE PUBLICLY THAT THEY VE DROPPED MARIJUANA TESTING THIS IS GOING TO BECOME THE NEW DON T ASK  DON T TELL  REIDY SAID IN MOST STATES THAT HAVE LEGALIZED MARIJUANA  LIKE COLORADO  BUSINESSES CAN STILL  IF THEY WISH  FIRE WORKERS WHO TEST POSITIVE  ON THE OTHER HAND  MAINE  WHICH ALSO LEGALIZED THE DRUG  BECAME THE FIRST STATE TO BAR COMPANIES FROM FIRING OR REFUSING TO HIRE SOMEONE FOR USING MARIJUANA OUTSIDE WORK COMPANIES IN LABOR INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES  HOTELIERS AND HOME HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND EMPLOYERS WITH MANY WAREHOUSE AND ASSEMBLY JOBS  ARE MOST LIKELY TO DROP MARIJUANA TESTING  BY CONTRAST  BUSINESSES THAT CONTRACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT OR THAT ARE IN REGULATED INDUSTRIES  LIKE AIR TRAVEL  OR THAT HAVE SAFETY CONCERNS INVOLVING MACHINERY  ARE CONTINUING MARIJUANA TESTS  EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS SAY  FEDERAL REGULATIONS REQUIRE THE TESTING OF PILOTS  TRAIN OPERATORS AND OTHER KEY TRANSPORTATION WORKERS DROPPING MARIJUANA TESTING IS MORE COMMON AMONG EMPLOYERS IN THE NINE STATES  ALONG WITH THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  THAT HAVE LEGALIZED POT FOR RECREATIONAL USE  AN ADDITIONAL 20 STATES ALLOW MARIJUANA FOR MEDICAL USE ONLY  BUT HISTORICALLY LOW UNEMPLOYMENT IS DRIVING CHANGE EVEN WHERE POT REMAINS ILLEGAL AFTER THE DRUG FREE WORKPLACE ACT WAS ENACTED IN 1988  AMID CONCERNS ABOUT COCAINE USE  DRUG TESTING SPREAD TO MOST LARGE COMPANIES  ALL FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES NOW ENGAGE IN SOME FORM OF DRUG TESTING  ACCORDING TO BARRY SAMPLE  A SENIOR DIRECTOR AT QUEST DIAGNOSTICS  ONE OF THE LARGEST TESTING FIRMS IN DENVER  IN A STATE WITH JUST 3 PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT  10 PERCENT OF EMPLOYERS THAT SCREEN FOR DRUGS HAD DROPPED MARIJUANA AS OF 2016  ACCORDING TO A SURVEY BY THE EMPLOYERS COUNCIL  WHICH PROVIDES CORPORATE LEGAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES SERVICES IT S BECAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT IS VIRTUALLY NON EXISTENT  IN COLORADO  SAID CURTIS GRAVES  A LAWYER AT THE COUNCIL   PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD TO TAKE A HARD LINE AGAINST OFF DUTY MARIJUANA USAGE IF THEY WANT TO HIRE THAT S PARTICULARLY TRUE IN COLORADO S RESORT AREAS  WHERE HOTELS AND SKI LIFTS ARE HEAVILY STAFFED WITH YOUNG WORKERS  GRAVES SAID   THEY CAN LOSE THEIR JOBS AND WALK ACROSS THE STREET AND GET ANOTHER ONE FPI  A PROPERTY MANAGEMENT FIRM IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT EMPLOYS 2 900 AROUND THE COUNTRY  FROM LEASING MANAGERS TO GROUNDSKEEPERS  HAS DOZENS OF JOBS LISTED ON ONLINE BOARDS  ITS ADS SAY APPLICANTS MUST PASS A  FULL BACKGROUND CHECK AND DRUG SCREENING BUT IT ADDS   AS IT RELATES TO MARIJUANA USE  FPI WILL CONSIDER ANY APPLICABLE STATE LAW WHEN DISPOSITIONING TEST RESULTS FPI DIDN T RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT  WHICH ISN T UNUSUAL GIVEN THAT COMPANIES THAT HAVE DROPPED MARIJUANA TESTS AREN T EXACTLY BILLBOARDING THEIR DECISIONS  MOST STILL SEEK TO MAINTAIN DRUG FREE WORKPLACES AND STILL TEST FOR HARDER DRUGS THEY RE PRETTY HUSH HUSH ABOUT IT  GRAVES SAID AUTONATION  WHICH OPERATES DEALERSHIPS IN 17 STATES  IS ONE OF THE FEW THAT HAVE GONE PUBLIC  THE COMPANY STOPPED TESTING FOR MARIJUANA ABOUT A YEAR AGO  MARC CANNON  A COMPANY SPOKESMAN  SAID IT DID SO MOSTLY IN RESPONSE TO EVOLVING PUBLIC ATTITUDES  BUT IT ALSO FEARED LOSING PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES THE LABOR MARKET HAS TIGHTENED UP  CANNON SAID AUTONATION HEARD FROM OTHER BUSINESS LEADERS  CANNON SAID  THEY SAID THINGS LIKE    WE RE DOING THE SAME THING  WE JUST DIDN T WANT TO SHARE IT PUBLICLY  RELAXED ATTITUDES AMONG EMPLOYERS ARE SPREADING FROM STATES WHERE RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA IS LEGAL TO THOSE WHERE IT S LAWFUL ONLY FOR MEDICAL USE  SUCH AS MICHIGAN AND NEW HAMPSHIRE JANIS PETRINI  WHO OWNS AN EXPRESS EMPLOYMENT STAFFING AGENCY IN GRAND RAPIDS  MICHIGAN  SAYS THAT WITH THE AREA S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE BELOW 3 PERCENT  EMPLOYERS ARE GROWING DESPERATE  SOME ARE WILLING TO IGNORE THE RESULTS OF DRUG TESTS PERFORMED BY EXPRESS  WHICH STILL SCREENS FOR MARIJUANA AND WON T PLACE WORKERS WHO TEST POSITIVE WE HAVE HAD COMPANIES SAY TO US   WE DON T WORRY ABOUT THAT AS MUCH AS WE USED TO   PETRINI SAID   WE SAY   OK  WELL  WE ARE STILL FOLLOWING OUR STANDARDS    ONE OF REIDY S CLIENTS  A MANUFACTURER IN NEW HAMPSHIRE  HAS DROPPED MARIJUANA TESTING BECAUSE IT DRAWS SOME WORKERS FROM NEIGHBORING MASSACHUSETTS AND MAINE  WHICH HAVE LEGALIZED POT FOR RECREATIONAL USE  ANOTHER CLIENT  WHICH RUNS ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES FROM FLORIDA TO MAINE  HAS STOPPED TESTING ITS HOUSEKEEPING AND FOOD SERVICE WORKERS FOR MARIJUANA THE STIGMA SURROUNDING MARIJUANA USE IS ERODING  COMPOUNDING PRESSURE ON EMPLOYERS TO STOP TESTING  SIXTY FOUR PERCENT OF AMERICANS SUPPORT LEGALIZING POT  A GALLUP POLL FOUND  THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE IN A HALF CENTURY OF SURVEYS IN LAS VEGAS  WHERE RECREATIONAL USE IS LEGAL  MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES  LOOK ALMOST LIKE APPLE STORES  SAID THORAN TOWLER  CEO OF THE NEVADA ASSOCIATION OF EMPLOYERS MANY HIGH TECH COMPANIES HAVE BEEN MOVING FROM CALIFORNIA TO NEVADA TO ESCAPE CALIFORNIA S HIGH COSTS  AND THEY RE SEEKING WORKERS  TOWLER SAYS THE MOST COMMON QUESTION FROM HIS 400 MEMBER EXECUTIVES IS   WHERE DO I FIND EMPLOYEES HE ESTIMATES THAT ROUGHLY ONE TENTH OF HIS GROUP S MEMBERS HAVE STOPPED TESTING FOR MARIJUANA OUT OF FRUSTRATION THEY SAY   I HAVE TO GET PEOPLE ON THE CASINO FLOOR OR MAKE THE BEDS  AND I CAN T WORRY ABOUT WHAT THEY RE DOING IN THEIR

20180501,entertainment,movies,1,THERE IS AN INTENSELY MOVING SCENE IN JANIES JANIE  1971  WHEN ITS SUBJECT ISSUES A DE FACTO DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE  BEFORE  I WAS MY FATHERS JANIE  SAYS THIS DETERMINED WOMAN  WHO WITH GRIT AND WELFARE CHECKS IS RAISING HER SIX CHILDREN ALONE IN AN ABJECT CORNER OF NEWARK  AND THEN I WAS CHARLIES JANIE  SHE SAYS OF HER ABUSIVE HUSBAND  NOW IM JANIES JANIE  AFTER A LIFETIME OF BEING TOLD BY BOTH MEN THAT SHE WAS NO GOOD  NO GOOD  NO GOOD  JANIE HAS SET HERSELF FREE DIRECTED BY A COLLECTIVE  THIS POWERFUL HALF HOUR FILM IS JUST ONE OF 42 TITLES IN THE BAMCINMATEKS REVELATORY SERIES A DIFFERENT PICTURE  WOMEN FILMMAKERS IN THE NEW HOLLYWOOD ERA  1967 1980  WHICH BEGINS ON WEDNESDAY  AS AMBITIOUS AS IT IS EXCITING  THIS SERIES ARRIVES AMID A RESURGENT FEMINISM THAT MOST RECENTLY HAS GALVANIZED AROUND THE ISSUE OF SEXUAL ABUSE  ONE OF THE CRITICAL FIGHTS IN WOMENS LIBERATION STRUGGLES CONTINUES TO BE FOR THE RIGHT TO BE HEARD  AS REBECCA SOLNIT RECENTLY WROTE OF THE HARVEY WEINSTEIN ALLEGATIONS  THE REVELATIONS SPURRED A RE EXAMINATION OF WHO WAS AUDIBLE AND WHO MATTERED  PUT DIFFERENTLY  WHO GETS TO TELL OUR STORIES IN MOVIES  WOMEN HAVENT OFTEN HAD THAT RIGHT  HAVING BEEN TOO OFTEN SHUT OUT  AND SHUT UP  ON SCREEN  AND YET THEY HAVE KEPT ON MAKING MOVIES  SPEAKING OUT AND SPEAKING UP  A DIFFERENT PICTURE MAKES THIS CLEAR IN A SERIES THAT  SELECTION AFTER SELECTION  IS AT ONCE AN ACT OF CINE ACTIVISM AND OF HISTORICAL REVISIONISM  IT ALSO CORRECTS THE FALLACY ABOUT WOMEN IN THE MOVIE INDUSTRY DURING THE PERIOD KNOWN AS NEW HOLLYWOOD  FAMED  AND OFTEN UNCRITICALLY FETISHIZED  FOR ITS MASTERWORKS AND SWAGGERING MACHISMO  THIS WAS THE ERA THAT BROUGHT US SOME OF THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS MALE AUTEURS IN HISTORY  INCLUDING MARTIN SCORSESE  PETER BOGDANOVICH  ROBERT ALTMAN AND HAL ASHBY A DIFFERENT PICTURE EXPANDS ON THE FAMILIAR STORY OF NEW HOLLYWOOD BY FOCUSING ON OVERLOOKED FILMMAKERS WORKING IN THE MAINSTREAM AS WELL AS ON A LARGER GROUP WORKING IN THE MARGINS  INCLUDING IN DOCUMENTARIES  EXPLOITATION FILMS AND THE AVANT GARDE  THE BREADTH OF WORK IS EXPANSIVE AND EXHILARATING  WITH TITLES AS DIVERSE AS STEPHANIE ROTHMANS THE STUDENT NURSES  THEYRE LEARNING FAST READS A TAGLINE FOR THIS SWINGY DIVERSION  CINDA FIRESTONES STILL URGENT DOCUMENTARY ATTICA ON THE PRISON UPRISING  AND EXPERIMENTAL MOVIES LIKE FILM ABOUT A WOMAN WHO  FROM THE CHOREOGRAPHER TURNED DIRECTOR YVONNE RAINER ALL THESE WOMEN SERVE AS A CORRECTIVE TO THE MALE CENTRIC MYTHOLOGIES THAT OFTEN ACCOMPANY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT FILM AUTEURS  AS THE SERIES PROGRAMMER JESSE TRUSSELL SAID IN AN EMAIL  CENTRAL TO THESE MYTHS IS THE FIGURE OF THE GREAT ARTIST AS A DICULT BAD BOY OUTSIDER  ESPECIALLY IN THIS PERIOD OF THE SEX AND DRUGS AND ROCK N ROLL 70S COUNTERCULTURE  THAT AUTEURISM HAS LONG BEEN NEARLY SYNONYMOUS WITH MALE DIRECTORIAL GENIUS IS PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE INDUSTRYS ENTRENCHED SEXISM  BUT ITS ALSO A MATTER OF THOSE WHO ANOINT  AND IMMORTALIZE  THESE GENIUSES  SO MUCH EORT HAS BEEN SPENT LIONIZING AND MYTHOLOGIZING THIS ERA  MR  TRUSSELL SAID  THAT WORK BY AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF WOMEN HAS BEEN ALMOST WRITTEN OUT OF HISTORY CONSIDER PETER BISKINDS ENTERTAINING 1998 BOOK EASY RIDERS  RAGING BULLS  HOW THE SEX DRUGS AND ROCKN ROLL GENERATION SAVED HOLLYWOOD  MR  BISKIND DOESNT MENTION BARBARA LODEN  WANDA  AND REFERS TO ELAINE MAY  A NEW LEAF AND MIKEY AND NICKY  ONLY IN PASSING  HE NOTES THAT MS  MAY WROTE HEAVEN CAN WAIT AND ALSO THAT SHE DATED JOHN CALLEY  A HOLLYWOOD POWER PLAYER  MS  MAY DESERVED FAR BETTER  OF COURSE  AND NOT ONLY BECAUSE SHE WAS AT THAT POINT ONE OF ONLY A FEW WOMEN SINCE THE 1920S HIRED TO DIRECT BY A STUDIO  I PITCHED VERY HARD  HER PRODUCER SAID  THAT HAVING A WOMAN DIRECTOR WOULD BE OF CONSEQUENCE ALTHOUGH MS  MAY REPEATEDLY CLASHED WITH PARAMOUNT WHILE MAKING A NEW LEAF  SHE LATER SUED THE STUDIO  THE MOVIE IS FLAT OUT GREAT  IN ONE OF HIS BEST PERFORMANCES  WALTER MATTHAU PLAYS A BANKRUPT SNOB WHO SCHEMES TO MARRY A CLUMSY HEIRESS AND BOTANY PROFESSOR PLAYED WITH SNEAKY CHARM BY MS  MAY  PARAMOUNT TOOK THE FILM AWAY FROM HER  SOFTENING IT  IN HER VERSION  THE MATTHAU CHARACTER KILLS SEVERAL PEOPLE  BUT ITS GENIUS REMAINS  JOHN CASSAVETES WAS SUCH A FAN OF MS  MAY THAT HE APPEARED ALONGSIDE HIS FREQUENT COLLABORATOR PETER FALK IN HER FANTASTIC MIKEY AND NICKY  ABOUT A SMALL TIME HOOD IN TROUBLE WHO CALLS AN OLD FRIEND FOR HELP TO GRASP HOW WOMEN AND MEN ARE TREATED DIFFERENTLY EVEN IN MOVIE HISTORIES ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS READ ABOUT MS  MAY  HER PROBLEMS WITH HOLLYWOOD  SHE WENT OVER SCHEDULE  SHOOTING MILES OF FILM  ARE LEGENDARY BUT RARELY  IF EVER  ARE THEY FRAMED AS A MATTER OF HER AUTEURIST PREROGATIVE  AS THEY OFTEN ARE WHEN MALE ARTISTS TAKE ON THE HOLLYWOOD BARBARIANS   THE AUTHOR OF A MONOGRAPH ON THE GODFATHER  ITS DIRECTOR  FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA  ALSO FAMOUSLY FOUGHT PARAMOUNT  DEEMS MS  MAYS THREE HOUR CUT OF A NEW LEAF UN RELEASABLE  THEREBY SIDING WITH THE STUDIO  AND DESCRIBES HER CHARACTER AS HOMELY AND MATTHAUS AS AN AGING GENTLEMAN FOR THE MOST PART  THE FEMALE DIRECTORS FEATURED IN A DIFFERENT PICTURE WORKED OUTSIDE OF HOLLYWOOD  INCLUDING IN NEW YORK  WHERE FILMMAKERS LIKE SHIRLEY CLARKE  PORTRAIT OF JASON  HAD LONG BEEN PART OF AN ENERGETIC COUNTER CINEMA  CLAUDIA WEILLS WONDERFUL GIRLFRIENDS WAS INDEPENDENTLY PRODUCED THERE  SOME OF THE MONEY CAME FROM GOVERNMENT ARTS COUNCILS  BEFORE IT WAS PICKED UP FOR DISTRIBUTION BY WARNER BROS  A GREAT MELANIE MAYRON PLAYS A PHOTOGRAPHER WHO FACES LONELINESS AFTER HER FEMALE ROOMMATE MOVES OUT  IN ITS INSISTENT FOCUS ON A WOMAN WHOSE IDENTITY ISNT SOLELY DETERMINED BY HER RELATIONSHIPS WITH MEN  GIRLFRIENDS ISNT JUST THRILLING  ITS RADICAL ANOTHER NEW YORK STORY IS JOAN MICKLIN SILVERS HESTER STREET  A DRAMA SET ON THE LOWER EAST SIDE IN 1896 WITH A LUMINOUS CAROL KANE AS A NEWLY ARRIVED ORTHODOX JEWISH WOMAN WHOSE ASSIMILATED HUSBAND HAS NO USE FOR HER  MS  SILVER ALSO WROTE THE FRONTIER EXPERIENCE  AN UNDERSEEN 25 MINUTE FILM DIRECTED BY BARBARA LODEN SET IN 1869 KANSAS  MS  LODEN PLAYS A PIONEER WHO  AFTER HER HUSBAND DIES  FENDS FOR HERSELF AND HER CHILDREN  BY TURNS AWKWARD AND ELEGANT  THE FILM IS FURTHER EVIDENCE OF A DIRECTING CAREER THAT COULD HAVE BEEN  MS  LODEN  WHO UNTIL THE RECENT RESURRECTION OF WANDA WAS OFTEN TREATED AS A FOOTNOTE IN FILM HISTORIES  DIED IN 1980 AT 48 ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE BETTER KNOWN MOVIES IN THE SERIES ARE AVAILABLE FOR HOME RENTAL  OTHERS ARE NOT AND REMAIN OUTSIDE THE COMMERCIAL MAINSTREAM  THE NUMBER OF SHORTS SUGGESTS THE BUDGET LIMITATIONS THAT WOMEN OFTEN FACED  AND STILL DO  THE MODEST RUNNING TIMES OF THEIR WORK  AS WELL AS THEIR SUBJECTS  ENSURING A LEVEL OF MARGINALIZATION  IN HER CRUCIAL  DEPRESSINGLY TOPICAL 1976 DOCUMENTARY FROM SPIKES TO SPINDLES  CHRISTINE CHOY FOCUSES ON ACTIVISM IN CHINATOWN IN NEW YORK AFTER ALLEGATIONS OF POLICE ABUSE  IN THE SWEEPING CHICANA  SYLVIA MORALES EXAMINES ANOTHER OVERLOOKED GROUP  CREATING A CHRONICLE OF IDENTITY THAT BEGINS WITH THE AZTECS AND WENDS ITS WAY TO LOS ANGELES A HANDFUL OF THE TITLES WERE FEATURED IN THE COMPLEMENTARY 2017 BAMCINMATEK PROGRAM  ONE WAY OR ANOTHER  BLACK WOMENS CINEMA  1970 1991  A DIFFERENT PICTURE GIVES YOU ANOTHER CHANCE TO SEE FILMS LIKE KATHLEEN COLLINSS THE CRUZ BROTHERS AND MISS MALLOY AND FRONZA WOODSS KILLING TIME  IN WHICH A WOMAN POSES IN A BEDROOM WHILE MUSING ON DEATH  HER PERFORMATIVE SELF AWARENESS CONVEYING DESPAIR AND ABSURDITY  IN FANNIES FILM  ANOTHER OF MS  WOODSS MUST SEE SHORTS  SHE JUXTAPOSES IMAGES OF WHITE PEOPLE IN AN EXERCISE STUDIO WITH AN INTERVIEW WITH A BLACK WOMAN  FANNIE DRAYTON  DESIGNATED IN THE FILM AS ONE OF THE INVISIBLE WOMEN  WHO CLEANS THAT SAME SPACE IT IS UNCLEAR IF MS  WOODS INTENDED THIS STUNNING FILM TO BE A BRUTAL  BRILLIANT ALLEGORY FOR WOMEN AND FILM  BUT ITS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO SEE IT AS SUCH

20180505,entertainment,fashion,6,THE ARKANSAS LYNCH MOB THAT BURNED A BLACK TENANT FARMER AT THE STAKE IN 1921 OBSERVED COMMON PRACTICE WHEN IT ADVERTISED THE KILLING IN ADVANCE SO SPECTATORS COULD MARK THE GRISLY EVENT ON THEIR CALENDARS  THE ORGANIZERS NOTIFIED NEWSPAPERS EARLY IN THE DAY THAT THEY PLANNED TO KILL HENRY LOWERY AS PAINFULLY AS POSSIBLE  GIVING EDITORS TIME TO PRODUCE SPECIAL EDITIONS THAT PROVIDED THE TIME  PLACE AND GRUESOME PARTICULARS OF THE DEATH TO COME HISTORIANS HAVE PAID SCANT ATTENTION TO THE ROLE THAT THE WHITE SOUTHERN PRESS PLAYED IN THE RACIAL TERRORISM OF THE LATE 19TH AND EARLY 20TH CENTURIES  WHICH SAW THOUSANDS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS HANGED  BURNED  DROWNED OR BEATEN TO DEATH BY WHITE MOBS  THIS ISSUE SURFACED IN DRAMATIC FASHION RECENTLY WHEN THE NEARLY TWO CENTURIES OLD MONTGOMERY ADVERTISER PRINTED A FRONT PAGE EDITORIAL APOLOGIZING FOR LYNCHING COVERAGE THAT DEHUMANIZED BLACK VICTIMS  THE APOLOGY COINCIDED WITH THE RECENT OPENING IN MONTGOMERY  ALA  OF A MEMORIAL TO LYNCHING VICTIMS  AND IT SETS THE STAGE FOR A TIMELY DISCUSSION OF A DEEPLY DISHONORABLE PERIOD IN SOUTHERN PRESS HISTORY THE BLOODY CELEBRATION AT WHICH 500 JEERING SPECTATORS SAW HENRY LOWERY BURNED TO ASHES WAS HELD AT NODENA  ARK  ON JAN  26  1921  AMONG THOSE IN ATTENDANCE WAS A REPORTER FOR THE MEMPHIS PRESS WHOSE STORY  UNDER THE HEADLINE KILL NEGRO BY INCHES  VALIDATED THE BARBARIC PROCEEDINGS AND CATALOGED THE VICTIMS SUFFERING IN LURID DETAIL  NOTING THAT LOWERY REMAINED STOICALLY SILENT EVEN AFTER THE FLESH HAD DROPPED AWAY FROM HIS LEGS AND THE FLAMES WERE LEAPING TOWARD HIS FACE LOWERY HAD BEEN CHARGED WITH A WANTON ACT OF MURDER FOR KILLING HIS WHITE LANDLORD AND THE LANDLORDS ADULT DAUGHTER  THE RENOWNED LYNCHING INVESTIGATOR WALTER WHITE LATER REPORTED THAT LOWERY HAD DRAWN A PISTOL ONLY AFTER BEING SHOT BY THE LANDLORDS SON AND PHYSICALLY ATTACKED BY THE LANDLORD HIMSELF IN A DISPUTE OVER WAGES  IN THE EYES OF THE LYNCHING STATE  WHERE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN COULD BE PUT TO DEATH ON A WHITE PERSONS WHIM  THE IMPULSE TOWARD SELF DEFENSE WAS OFTEN VIEWED AS A CRIME WHEN IT CAME WITH A BLACK FACE NEWSPAPERS EVEN BRAGGED ABOUT THE ROLES THEY HAD PLAYED IN ARRANGING PARTICULARLY SPECTACULAR LYNCHINGS  BUT THE REAL DAMAGE WAS DONE IN TERSE  WORKADAY STORIES THAT JUSTIFIED LYNCHING BY CASTING ITS VICTIMS AS FIENDS  BRUTES  BORN CRIMINALS OR  THAT CATCHALL FAVORITE  TROUBLESOME NEGROES  THE NARRATIVE THAT TIED BLACKNESS INEXTRICABLY TO CRIMINALITY  AND TO THE DEATH PENALTY  SURVIVED THE LYNCHING ERA AND LIVES ON TO THIS DAY THE MONTGOMERY ADVERTISER WAS HISTORICALLY OPPOSED TO LYNCHING  NEVERTHELESS  WHEN ITS CURRENT STAFF SCRUTINIZED THE PAPERS LYNCHING ERA COVERAGE  THEY CONCLUDED THAT IT HAD CONVENIENTLY OPPOSED LYNCHING IN THE ABSTRACT WHILE RESPONDING WITH INDIFFERENCE TO ITS BLOODY  REAL WORLD CONSEQUENCES  THE EDITORS FOUND THAT THE PAPER TOO OFTEN PRESUMED WITHOUT PROOF THAT LYNCHING VICTIMS WERE GUILTY AND THAT  IN DOING SO  IT ADVANCED THE AIMS OF WHITE SUPREMACIST RULE THAT DESCRIPTION APPLIES BROADLY TO THE JIM CROW ERA SOUTH  WHERE EVEN NEWSPAPERS THAT WERE VIEWED AS LIBERAL REPLICATED THE APARTHEID STATE WITHIN THEIR PAGES  BY SEPARATING NEWS AND BIRTH ANNOUNCEMENTS BY RACE  BY RENDERING LAW ABIDING BLACK PEOPLE INVISIBLE AND ESPECIALLY BY DENYING AFRICAN AMERICANS THE COURTESY TITLES MR  AND MRS  THIS HUMILIATING PRACTICE WAS MEANT TO ILLUSTRATE THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF RACIAL EQUALITY  IT ALSO LET WHITE READERS KNOW WHEN A BLACK PERSON WAS BEING QUOTED SO THAT THE PERSONS STATEMENT COULD BE IGNORED THE NEWSPAPER EDITOR IRA HARKEY  WHO WAS WHITE  INCURRED OUTRAGE IN 1949 WHEN HE ABANDONED THE SOUTHERN JOURNALISTIC PRACTICE OF AUTOMATICALLY LABELING BLACK PEOPLE BY RACE IN STORIES AND BEGAN CAUTIOUSLY EXTENDING THE COURTESY TITLE MRS  IN THE PAGES OF THE PASCAGOULA CHRONICLE STAR TO CERTAIN CAREFULLY SELECTED NEGRO WOMEN SUCH AS TEACHERS AND NURSES  HARKEY WAS REVILED  AND SHOT AT  BY RACISTS IN MISSISSIPPI FOR CHAMPIONING CIVIL RIGHTS  HE WROTE BITTERLY OF HIS EARLIER YEARS AT THE NEW ORLEANS TIMES PICAYUNE  WHERE THERE WAS A FLAT RULE THAT NEGROES WERE NOT TO APPEAR IN PHOTOGRAPHS  IT WAS REQUIRED THAT THEY BE AIRBRUSHED OUT OF CROWD SCENES THE MONTGOMERY ADVERTISER  KNOWN IN THE 19TH CENTURY AS THE LEADING PAPER OF THE CONFEDERACY  PUT ITSELF ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HISTORY IN COUNTLESS WAYS  NOT LEAST BY RIDICULING THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THAT WAS LAUNCHED BY THE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT IN 1955 AND REACHED ITS ZENITH A DECADE LATER WITH THE MARCH FROM SELMA TO MONTGOMERY AND THE PASSAGE OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT BRO KRIFT  NOW THE PAPERS 41 YEAR OLD EXECUTIVE EDITOR  WAS WELL AWARE OF THIS HISTORY WHEN HE GREETED THE OPENING OF THE LYNCHING MEMORIAL BY

20180505,politics,election,8,WASHINGTON  PRESIDENT TRUMP KNEW ABOUT A SIX FIGURE PAYMENT THAT MICHAEL D  COHEN  HIS PERSONAL LAWYER  MADE TO A PORNOGRAPHIC FILM ACTRESS SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE HE DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE OF IT TO REPORTERS ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE IN APRIL  ACCORDING TO TWO PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE ARRANGEMENT HOW MUCH MR  TRUMP KNEW ABOUT THE PAYMENT TO STEPHANIE CLIFFORD  THE ACTRESS  AND WHO ELSE WAS AWARE OF IT HAVE BEEN AT THE CENTER OF A SWIRLING CONTROVERSY FOR THE PAST 48 HOURS TOUCHED OFF BY A TELEVISION INTERVIEW WITH RUDOLPH W  GIULIANI  A NEW ADDITION TO THE PRESIDENTS LEGAL TEAM  THE INTERVIEW WAS THE FIRST TIME A LAWYER FOR THE PRESIDENT HAD ACKNOWLEDGED THAT MR  TRUMP HAD REIMBURSED MR  COHEN FOR THE PAYMENTS TO MS  CLIFFORD  WHOSE STAGE NAME IS STORMY DANIELS IT WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY CLEAR WHEN MR  TRUMP LEARNED OF THE PAYMENT  WHICH MR  COHEN MADE IN OCTOBER 2016  AT A TIME WHEN NEWS MEDIA OUTLETS WERE POISED TO PAY HER FOR HER STORY ABOUT AN ALLEGED AFFAIR WITH MR  TRUMP IN 2006  BUT THREE PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE MATTER SAID THAT MR  TRUMP KNEW THAT MR  COHEN HAD SUCCEEDED IN KEEPING THE ALLEGATIONS FROM BECOMING PUBLIC AT THE TIME THE PRESIDENT DENIED IT MS  CLIFFORD SIGNED A NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT  AND ACCEPTED THE PAYMENT JUST DAYS BEFORE MR  TRUMP WON THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION  MR  TRUMP HAS DENIED HE HAD AN AFFAIR WITH MS  CLIFFORD AND INSISTED THAT THE NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT WAS CREATED TO PREVENT ANY EMBARRASSMENT TO HIS FAMILY MR  GIULIANI SAID THIS WEEK THAT THE REIMBURSEMENT TO MR  COHEN TOTALED  000 OR  000  LEAVING IT UNCLEAR WHAT ELSE THE PAYMENTS WERE FOR BEYOND THE  000 THAT WENT TO MS  CLIFFORD  ONE OF THE PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE ARRANGEMENT SAID THAT IT WAS A  000 TOTAL OVER 12 MONTHS ALLEN WEISSELBERG  THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION  HAS KNOWN SINCE LAST YEAR THE DETAILS OF HOW MR  COHEN WAS BEING REIMBURSED  WHICH WAS MAINLY THROUGH PAYMENTS OF  000 PER MONTH FROM THE TRUST THAT CONTAINS THE PRESIDENTS PERSONAL FORTUNE  ACCORDING TO TWO PEOPLE WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE ARRANGEMENT ONE PERSON CLOSE TO THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION SAID PEOPLE WITH THE COMPANY WERE AWARE THAT MR  COHEN WAS STILL DOING LEGAL WORK FOR THE PRESIDENT IN 2017  BUT ANOTHER PERSON FAMILIAR WITH THE SITUATION SAID THAT MR  WEISSELBERG DID NOT KNOW THAT MR  COHEN HAD PAID MS  CLIFFORD WHEN THE RETAINER AGREEMENT WAS STRUCK AND WHEN THE PAYMENTS WENT THROUGH MR  WEISSELBERGS KNOWLEDGE OF THE RETAINER AGREEMENT COULD DRAW MR  TRUMPS COMPANY DEEPER INTO THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION OF MR  COHENS ACTIVITIES  INCREASING THE PRESIDENTS LEGAL EXPOSURE IN A WIDE RANGING CASE INVOLVING THE LAWYER OFTEN DESCRIBED AS THE PRESIDENTS FIXER IN NEW YORK CITY IN INTERVIEWS ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY  MR  GIULIANI INSISTED THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD REIMBURSED MR  COHEN FOR THE  000 HUSH PAYMENT  AND THEN PAID HIM ANOTHER  000  IF NOT MORE  WHICH WAS IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH THE LONGSTANDING ASSERTION BY MR  TRUMP AND THE WHITE HOUSE THAT HE DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE HUSH MONEY OR WHERE IT CAME FROM IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE NEW YORK TIMES ON FRIDAY  MR  GIULIANI SOUGHT TO CLARIFY HIS STATEMENTS BY SAYING THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER MR  TRUMP HAD KNOWN THAT SOME OF THE PAYMENTS TO MR  COHEN HAD GONE TO MS  CLIFFORD  ITS NOT SOMETHING IM AWARE OF  NOR IS IT RELEVANT TO WHAT IM DOING  THE LEGAL PART  MR  GIULIANI SAID MR  GIULIANI ACKNOWLEDGED THAT POLITICALLY  IT COULD BE TROUBLESOME  POLITICALLY  EVERYTHING MATTERS  BUT I DONT SEE A PROBLEM HERE  AT LEAST NOT LEGALLY  HE SAID A LAWYER FOR THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION DECLINED TO COMMENT  AND A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE ORGANIZATION DID NOT RESPOND TO AN EMAIL ABOUT MR  WEISSELBERG THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID THAT HE WOULD VIEW ANY INVESTIGATION INTO HIS FINANCES OR THOSE OF HIS FAMILY AS A VIOLATION  THOUGH HE WAS REFERRING TO THE INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIA BY THE SPECIAL COUNSEL  ROBERT S  MUELLER III  THE INVESTIGATION INTO MR  COHEN IS BEING RUN BY FEDERAL PROSECUTORS IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK THE PAYMENT TO MS  CLIFFORD IS A PART OF THAT INVESTIGATION  THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING IT HAD BECOME ALL THE MURKIER THIS WEEK AFTER MR  GIULIANI GAVE AN EXPLANATION OF HOW THE FUNDS TO MS  CLIFFORD WERE ACCOUNTED FOR THAT CONTRADICTED ALL THOSE THAT CAME BEFORE IT AFTER INITIALLY APPEARING TO BACK MR  GIULIANIS ASSERTIONS IN A SERIES OF TWITTER MESSAGES ON THURSDAY  MR  TRUMP REVERSED COURSE ON FRIDAY  AFTER A SERIES OF HEADLINES SUGGESTING THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD LIED ABOUT KNOWING OF THE HUSH PAYMENT  IN REMARKS TO REPORTERS ON FRIDAY  MR  TRUMP CRITICIZED MR  GIULIANI AND SAID HE WOULD EVENTUALLY GET HIS FACTS STRAIGHT VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING SAID HAS BEEN SAID INCORRECTLY  AND ITS BEEN SAID WRONG  OR ITS BEEN COVERED WRONG BY THE PRESS  MR  TRUMP TOLD REPORTERS  THOUGH HE EXCUSED MR  GIULIANI BY EXPLAINING HE HAD JUST STARTED A DAY AGO IN A WRITTEN STATEMENT LATER IN THE DAY  MR  GIULIANI SAID THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN DESCRIBING MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRESIDENTS KNOWLEDGE  AND HE REVERSED A PREVIOUS SUGGESTION THAT THE PAYMENT TO MS  CLIFFORD WAS MOTIVATED BY THE ELECTION  MR  GIULIANI SAID ON FRIDAY THAT THE PAYMENT WAS PERSONAL IN NATURE AND WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE IN ANY EVENT  WHETHER HE WAS A CANDIDATE OR NOT  MR  GIULIANI TOLD THE TIMES THAT HE HAD CONFUSED THE TWO FACTORS  BUT THAT IT WAS IRRELEVANT SINCE MR  TRUMP HAD REPAID MR  COHEN WHILE SOME WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS HAD INSISTED THAT MR  TRUMP WAS PLEASED WITH MR  GIULIANIS PERFORMANCE ON FOX NEWS IN AN INTERVIEW WITH SEAN HANNITY ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT  TWO PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT PAINTED A DIFFERENT PICTURE  THEY SAID THAT MR  TRUMP WAS DISPLEASED WITH HOW MR  GIULIANI  A FORMER NEW YORK MAYOR  CONDUCTED HIMSELF  AND THAT HE WAS ALSO UNHAPPY WITH MR  HANNITY  A COMMENTATOR WHOSE ADVICE THE PRESIDENT OFTEN SEEKS  IN TERMS OF THE LANGUAGE HE USED TO DESCRIBE THE PAYMENTS TO MS  CLIFFORD THE NATURE OF THE PAYMENTS IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS THAT REGULATE WHO MAY CONTRIBUTE TO CANDIDATES AND HOW MUCH THEY CAN GIVE IF MR  COHEN OR OTHERS PAID TO SILENCE MS  CLIFFORD PRIMARILY OUT OF FEAR THAT A PUBLIC AIRING OF HER STORY WOULD HAVE HARMED MR  TRUMPS ELECTION PROSPECTS  RATHER THAN TO KEEP IT FROM HIS FAMILY FOR PERSONAL REASONS  THEN THE PAYMENT WOULD MOST LIKELY BE VIEWED AS AN ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURE  MR  GIULIANI TOLD THE TIMES ON FRIDAY THAT THE ISSUE WAS PRIMARILY ABOUT KEEPING MR  TRUMPS WIFE  MELANIA  FROM BEING EMBARRASSED BY THE CLAIM  WHICH MR  TRUMP HAS MAINTAINED WAS FALSE BUT IF INVESTIGATORS DETERMINE THAT THE HUSH PAYMENT WAS IN EFFECT A CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURE  THEN HOW THE FUNDS WERE DISTRIBUTED COULD TAKE ON ADDED LEGAL SIGNIFICANCE  MR  COHEN HAD BEEN CAREFUL TO SAY THAT NEITHER THE CAMPAIGN NOR THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION WAS INVOLVED IN THE DEAL OR ANY EFFORT TO REIMBURSE HIM UNDER CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAW  MR  TRUMP WOULD HAVE BEEN WITHIN HIS RIGHTS TO PAY MS  CLIFFORD HIMSELF AS A WAY TO PROTECT HIS PRESIDENTIAL PROSPECTS  THOUGH HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE FORMALLY MADE NOTE OF IT IN HIS PUBLIC CAMPAIGN FILINGS  WHICH HAD NO ACCOUNTING OF THE PAYMENT  IF HE DIRECTED MR  COHEN TO PAY IT ON HIS BEHALF  THEN THAT COULD QUALIFY AS AN ILLEGAL  COORDINATED CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURE  EVEN IF MR  TRUMP LATER PAID HIM BACK ANY INVOLVEMENT BY THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION WOULD FURTHER COMPLICATE THE LEGAL PICTURE  GIVEN THAT AMERICAN ELECTION LAW IS STRICTEST OF ALL WHEN IT COMES TO CORPORATE INVOLVEMENT WITH POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS  BUSINESSES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DONATE DIRECTLY TO CAMPAIGNS OR TO COORDINATE WITH THEM MS  CLIFFORDS LAWYER  MICHAEL J  AVENATTI  HAS BEEN ARGUING FOR MONTHS THAT MR  TRUMPS COMPANY WAS MORE INVOLVED IN THE ARRANGEMENT THAN MR  COHEN HAD BEEN LETTING ON AFTER FILING A LAWSUIT ON MS  CLIFFORDS BEHALF SEEKING TO GET OUT OF THE DEAL  WHICH HE HAS CALLED INVALID  MR  AVENATTI SHOWED THAT MR  COHEN HAD USED HIS TRUMP ORGANIZATION EMAIL AT ONE POINT IN ARRANGING THE PAYMENT  HE ALSO POINTED TO A SECRET DOCUMENT IN CALIFORNIA THAT A TRUMP ORGANIZATION LAWYER FILED TO FORCE MS  CLIFFORD INTO ARBITRATION THIS YEAR AT THE TIME  THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION SAID THAT THE LAWYER  JILL A  MARTIN  WHO WORKS IN CALIFORNIA  HAD ACTED IN A PERSONAL CAPACITY TO HELP MR  COHEN  WHO NEEDED ASSISTANCE WITH THE INITIAL ARBITRATION FILING FROM SOMEONE LICENSED IN THE STATE  THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION HAD SAID THAT THE COMPANY HAS HAD NO INVOLVEMENT IN THE MATTER IN AN INTERVIEW  MR  AVENATTI SAID THAT ANY INDICATION THAT STILL MORE EXECUTIVES AT THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION KNEW ABOUT THE EFFORT TO REIMBURSE MR  COHEN FOR THE PAYMENT TO MS  CLIFFORD COULD LEAD TO FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE TRUMP FAMILY BUSINESS THERES NO QUESTION IT OPENS UP ANOTHER AVENUE OF INQUIRY INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION  HE SAID
20180501,politics,trump,10,WASHINGTON  THE U S  GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE ANOTHER 30 DAYS TO DECIDE WHETHER TO IMPOSE TARIFFS ON IMPORTS OF STEEL AND ALUMINUM FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION  CANADA AND MEXICO  EXTENDING A PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY FOR BUSINESSES IN THOSE REGIONS THE DELAY HELPS THE U S  AVOID A POTENTIAL TRADE WAR WITH ALLIES AS IT PREPARES FOR TENSE TRADE TALKS IN CHINA THIS WEEK  BUT THE EU SLAMMED THE DECISION AS BAD FOR BUSINESS THAT  PROLONGS MARKET UNCERTAINTY  WHICH IS ALREADY AFFECTING BUSINESS DECISIONS AS A LONGSTANDING PARTNER AND FRIEND OF THE U S  WE WILL NOT NEGOTIATE UNDER THREAT  THE EU SAID IN A STATEMENT TUESDAY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAID MONDAY IT HAD REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH SOUTH KOREA ON STEEL IMPORTS FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS ON A REVISED TRADE AGREEMENT  AND THE ADMINISTRATION SAID IT HAD ALSO REACHED AGREEMENTS IN PRINCIPLE WITH ARGENTINA  AUSTRALIA AND BRAZIL ON STEEL AND ALUMINUM THAT WILL BE FINALIZED SHORTLY IN ALL OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS  THE ADMINISTRATION IS FOCUSED ON QUOTAS THAT WILL RESTRAIN IMPORTS  PREVENT TRANSSHIPMENT AND PROTECT THE NATIONAL SECURITY  THE WHITE HOUSE SAID FACING A SELF IMPOSED DEADLINE  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WAS CONSIDERING WHETHER TO PERMANENTLY EXEMPT THE EU AND MEXICO  CANADA  AUSTRALIA  ARGENTINA AND BRAZIL FROM TARIFFS OF 25 PERCENT ON IMPORTED STEEL AND 10 PERCENT ON IMPORTED ALUMINUM THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION IMPOSED IN MARCH  THE WHITE HOUSE HAD GIVEN ITSELF UNTIL THE END OF MONDAY TO DECIDE WHETHER TO EXTEND THE EXEMPTIONS THE EU HAS TAKEN A TOUGH STANCE  RAISING THE PROSPECT OF A TRADE WAR IF THE U S  DOES NOT BACK DOWN  IT HAS A LIST OF RETALIATORY TARIFFS WORTH ABOUT  5 BILLION ON IMPORTS FROM THE U S  THAT IT WILL ACTIVATE IF THE EU LOSES ITS EXEMPTION GERMANY SAID IT CONTINUES TO EXPECT A PERMANENT EXEMPTION  THE EU S LARGEST STEEL EXPORTER TO THE U S  IT ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 5 PERCENT OF U S  STEEL IMPORTS LAST YEAR NEITHER THE EU NOR THE U S  CAN HAVE AN INTEREST IN AN ESCALATION OF THEIR TRADE TENSIONS  A SPOKESWOMAN FOR CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL SAID TUESDAY IN A STATEMENT EUROPEAN FINANCIAL OFFICIALS HAVE CITED THE TRADE TENSIONS CREATED BY THE U S  TARIFFS PROPOSAL AS A RISK TO THE ECONOMY  SOME SURVEYS SUGGEST A DOWNTICK IN BUSINESS AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE  THOUGH IT S UNCLEAR HOW BIG AN IMPACT THE TRADE TENSIONS ARE HAVING WHILE EXPERTS SAY THE IMMEDIATE POTENTIAL DAMAGE FROM THE ALUMINUM AND STEEL TARIFFS IS LIMITED  THE DANGER IS OF A TIT FOR TAT ESCALATION IN WHICH BOTH SIDES SLAP MORE DUTIES ON EACH OTHER S GOODS THE IMPOSITION OF TARIFFS MIGHT SIGNAL THAT THE TWO REGIONS ARE HEADING TOWARDS A MORE SERIOUS TRADE CONFLICT  SAID STEPHEN BROWN  EUROPEAN ECONOMIST AT CAPITAL ECONOMICS TRUMP SAYS HE WANTS TO PROTECT AMERICAN METAL PRODUCERS FROM UNFAIR COMPETITION AND BOLSTER NATIONAL SECURITY  BUT THE TARIFFS  ANNOUNCEMENT IN MARCH  WHICH FOLLOWED AN INTENSE INTERNAL WHITE HOUSE DEBATE  TRIGGERED HARSH CRITICISM FROM DEMOCRATS AND SOME REPUBLICANS AND ROILED FINANCIAL MARKETS AT THE TIME  TRUMP EXCLUDED SEVERAL VITAL TRADING PARTNERS  THE EU  MEXICO  CANADA  AUSTRALIA  ARGENTINA AND BRAZIL  FROM THE TARIFFS THAT MEANT THE STEEL TARIFF COVERED JUST 30 PERCENT OF ALL IMPORTS  ACCORDING TO OXFORD ECONOMICS  IF ALL THE EXEMPTIONS WERE ENDED  IT WOULD HAVE DEEPENED THE IMPACT OF THE TARIFFS ON AMERICAN COMPANIES THAT USE STEEL AND POTENTIALLY AFFECT FINANCIAL MARKETS  STOCK PRICES FELL NEARLY 2 PERCENT WHEN THE TARIFFS WERE ANNOUNCED TWO PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCESS SAID THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN CONSIDERING WHETHER TO PROVIDE A SHORT TERM EXTENSION OF THE EXEMPTIONS TO ALLOW FOR MORE TIME TO REVIEW THE COUNTRIES  EFFORTS TO SECURE PERMANENT EXEMPTIONS  THE OFFICIALS SPOKE ONLY ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY TO DESCRIBE INTERNAL DELIBERATIONS THE EU AND OTHERS HAD BEEN ASKED TO SPELL OUT WHAT LIMITS THEY COULD ACCEPT ON THE AMOUNT OF STEEL THEY EXPORT TO THE UNITED STATES  HOW THEY WOULD ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF EXCESS PRODUCTION OF STEEL AND ALUMINUM  AND HOW THEY WOULD SUPPORT THE U S  BEFORE INTERNATIONAL BODIES LIKE THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION  SECURITY RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE U S  HAVE ALSO BEEN PART OF THE CRITERIA SOUTH KOREA MADE UP THE LARGEST SHARE OF U S  STEEL IMPORTS LAST YEAR  SHIPPING ABOUT 13 PERCENT OF U S  IMPORTS  ACCORDING TO AN AMERICAN IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE ANALYSIS OF GOVERNMENT DATA  IT HAS AGREED TO LIMIT ITS EXPORTS TO THE UNITED STATES AND WAS GRANTED A PERMANENT EXEMPTION CHINA  JAPAN AND RUSSIA HAVEN T RECEIVED EXEMPTIONS  WHICH WILL LIKELY REDUCE STEEL SHIPMENTS FROM THOSE COUNTRIES OVER TIME  COMMERCE SECRETARY WILBUR ROSS SAID FRIDAY THAT QUOTAS ON IMPORTS FROM EUROPE AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE NECESSARY SO IMPORTS FROM THOSE COUNTRIES DON T SIMPLY REPLACE CHINESE IMPORTS  THE GOAL OF THE TARIFFS IS TO REDUCE TOTAL STEEL IMPORTS AND BOOST U S  PRODUCTION  ROSS SAID IF YOU LET EVERYBODY BACK OUT OF THE TARIFF  AND YOU LET THEM OUT OF ANY KIND OF QUOTA  HOW WOULD YOU EVER REDUCE THE IMPORTS HERE  ROSS ASKED AT A CONFERENCE OF JOURNALISTS EUROPEAN LEADERS HAVE RESISTED THE IDEA OF A QUOTA  MERKEL SAID SUNDAY THAT SHE DISCUSSED THE ISSUE WITH FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON AND BRITISH PRIME MINISTER THERESA MAY AFTER RETURNING FROM A WHITE HOUSE VISIT FRIDAY IN HER MEETING WITH TRUMP  MERKEL SAID  SHE SAW LITTLE PROGRESS IN OBTAINING

AS A PUBLIC SERVANT  THE MORE THAN 10 000 DOCUMENTS  MADE PUBLIC AS PART OF A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LAWSUIT BY THE SIERRA CLUB  SHOW THAT THE AGENCYS CLOSE CONTROL OF MR  PRUITTS EVENTS IS DRIVEN

BUT WHAT IVE BEEN TELLING FRIENDS RECENTLY IS THIS  IF YOURE ANYWHERE IN BRITAIN THIS AUGUST THEN RUN  DONT WALK  TO THE KETTLEWELL SCARECROW FESTIVAL IN YORKSHIRE KETTLEWELL  WITH ITS FRIENDLY RESIDENTS  NEAT HOUSES HUDDLED TOGETHER AS IF FOR WARMTH  AND ATMOSPHERIC PUBS OFFERING LOCAL ALES AND REAL FIRES  IS AS COZY AND WELCOMING AS THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE OF THE YORKSHIRE DALES IS AWE INSPIRING  LOOMING BEYOND EVERY NARROW VILLAGE STREET  IT SEEMS  ARE STEEP GREEN HILLSIDES THAT ARE VEINED WITH STONE WALLS  RUSHING BROOKS AND ANCIENT  WINDING FOOTPATHS  AND DOTTED WITH SHEEP WHO TAKE NO NOTICE OF THE RACING SHADOWS OF THE FAST CHANGING CLOUDS  ALL THATS MISSING  IT SEEMS  ARE THE CROWS  WHICH MAY LARGELY STEER CLEAR OF A VILLAGE THAT EACH AUGUST GOES TO SO MUCH TROUBLE TO FETE THE ARRIVAL OF AROUND 100 NEW STRAW STUFFED CITIZENS SCARECROWS HAVE A LONG HISTORY IN ENGLAND  AND A CULTURAL PRESENCE THAT PREDATES THE JOURNEY OF DOROTHY AND HER COMPANIONS DOWN L  FRANK BAUMS YELLOW BRICK ROAD  ONE OF THE FIRST LITERARY REFERENCES TO SCARECROWS CAME IN EDMUND SPENSERS LATE 16TH CENTURY THE FAERIE QUEENE  WHILE SHAKESPEARE AND DANIEL DEFOE ALSO DEPLOYED SCARECROW IMAGERY  SCARECROW FESTIVALS  HOWEVER  ARE UNDERSTOOD TO BE A MODERN TRADITION  KETTLEWELLS DATES FROM THE MID 1990S  ACCORDING TO NICKY FAIRWEATHER  A MEMBER OF THE VILLAGES PLEASINGLY NAMED SCARECROW COMMITTEE AMONG SCARECROW FESTIVALS  THATS A REASONABLY LONG PEDIGREE  BUT DONT WORRY IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST SUCH RODEO  BECAUSE THE BASICS OF A SCARECROW FESTIVAL ARE EASY TO GRASP  FOR AROUND A WEEK EACH SUMMER  AUG  11 TO 19 THIS YEAR  KETTLEWELLS RESIDENTS DECORATE THE BENCHES  LAWNS  AND NOOKS AND CRANNIES OF THEIR VILLAGE WITH LOCALLY CRAFTED SCARECROWS  MANY SCARECROWS ARE INSPIRED BY HISTORICAL OR LITERARY CHARACTERS  POLITICAL AND POPULAR CULTURE FIGURES ALSO APPEAR  AND IN THIS WAY A QUIET ENGLISH VILLAGE RAISES AN UNLIKELY SCARECROW FILLED MIRROR TO THE GLOBAL ZEITGEIST  LAST YEARS FESTIVAL FEATURED A QUEEN VICTORIA  ACCOMPANIED BY A SIGN THAT READ  LIE BACK AND THINK OF ENGLAND  A DAVID BOWIE AND AT LEAST FOUR PRESIDENT TRUMPS YOU CAN GUIDE YOURSELF THROUGH KETTLEWELL WITH A SCARECROW TRAIL MAP  OR YOU CAN TAKE A FREE RANGE APPROACH  RECALLING PICTURESQUE LINES FROM YOUR FAVORITE ENGLISH NOVELS AS YOU CROSS THE VILLAGES BUBBLING BECK  OR STREAM  WHEN YOU NEAR THE EDGE OF THE VILLAGE  INDEED  KETTLEWELL IS SO SMALL THAT YOU COULD INADVERTENTLY WANDER OUT OF IT IN THE COURSE OF COMPOSING A LONG TEXT MESSAGE HOME  YOU MIGHT PLAN A FORAY INTO THE YORKSHIRE COUNTRYSIDE THATS ALL AROUND YOU  PERHAPS ON THE DALES WAY  A ROUGHLY 80 MILE LONG TRAIL THAT RUNS RIGHT THROUGH THE VILLAGE WITH OR WITHOUT ITS SCARECROWS  KETTLEWELL IS A PARTICULARLY FINE PLACE TO INDULGE IN A CELEBRATION OF RURAL ENGLISHNESS  ANGLOPHILES MAY FIND THEMSELVES MARVELING AT THE NAMES SIGNPOSTED ON INDIVIDUAL HOMES  NAMES SO QUINTESSENTIALLY ENGLISH THAT EVEN THE BRASHEST AMERICAN DEVELOPER MIGHT PAUSE BEFORE SLAPPING THEM ONTO A NEW SUBDIVISION  MY FAVORITE HOUSE NAMES IN KETTLEWELL INCLUDE GREEN LEA  LADYCROFT AND FELL FOOT  THEN THERE ARE THE WOODEN SIGNS THAT ANNOUNCE THE DISTANCES  ALONG A FOOTPATH  TO PROVIDENCE POT  ONE AND A HALF MILES  AND GREAT WHERNSIDE VIA HAG DYKE  TWO MILES MEANWHILE  FANS OF THE GREAT BRITISH BAKE OFF  OR THE GREAT BRITISH BAKING SHOW AS ITS CALLED IN THE UNITED STATES  SHOULD ABANDON THE SCARECROW TRAIL AT THE FIRST SIGN OF RAIN AND HEAD STRAIGHT TO THE VILLAGE HALL  HERE YOU CAN PURCHASE EMERGENCY RAIN PONCHOS  1  OR AROUND  40  AND  MORE IMPORTANT  A FEW OF THE DELIGHTFUL TREATS PREPARED BY THE FESTIVALS BAKE OFF CALIBER VOLUNTEERS  I SAMPLED BOTH THE GLUTEN FREE VICTORIA SANDWICH AND THE PARKIN  A DISTINCTIVELY YORKSHIRE VARIETY OF GINGERBREAD CAKE  OR TRY THE WENSLEYDALE CHEESE  FOR WHICH A SIGN OFFERS TRAVELERS OF THE WHEN IN ROME PERSUASION SOME ENTHUSIASTIC ADVICE  ENJOY IT WITH YOUR FRUIT CAKE IN TRUE YORKSHIRE FASHION THE CHEERFULNESS OF THE FESTIVAL DOESNT QUITE OBSCURE KETTLEWELLS SENSE OF HISTORY AND CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY  LAST YEAR  FOR EXAMPLE  ONE EXHIBIT FEATURED CHILD SCARECROWS CLUTCHING TEDDY BEARS  I OVERHEARD A FATHER TELL HIS SILENT YOUNG SON THAT THE DISPLAY HONORED THE NEARBY LINTON CAMP  TO WHICH CHILDREN FROM THE NEARBY CITY OF BRADFORD WERE EVACUATED DURING WORLD WAR II  MS  FAIRWEATHER  OF THE SCARECROW COMMITTEE  WAS ALSO AT PAINS TO POINT OUT THE PURPOSE OF THE FESTIVAL  TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE LOCAL SCHOOL  VILLAGE HALL AND CHURCH  ITS THAT MISSION  SHE SAID  THAT EXPLAINS THE COMMUNITYWIDE ENTHUSIASM THATS SO OBVIOUS TO VISITORS  WERE NOT JUST ALL COMPLETE NUTTERS  SHE SAID WITH A LAUGH  THERE IS A HARD REASON TO DO IT THIS BEING ENGLAND  OF COURSE  SUCH SERIOUSNESS COEXISTS COMFORTABLY WITH FLASHES OF HUMOR AND AN AFFECTION FOR IRREVERENCE  ONE OF THE PRESIDENT TRUMP SCARECROWS WAS IN STOCKS  I SAW A CHILD  PERHAPS 5  AND WITH HAIR EVEN YELLOWER THAN THE PRESIDENTS  RUN UP TO ANOTHER AND YELL  YOURE FIRED  WHEN PRESSED ABOUT THE RULES THAT VILLAGERS MUST FOLLOW WHEN CREATING THEIR SCARECROWS  THE IDEA  SAID MS  FAIRWEATHER  IS TO KEEP IT CLEAN  YET OVERNIGHT  SHE ACKNOWLEDGED  MISCHIEF MAKERS MIGHT OCCASIONALLY REARRANGE THE POSITION OF A SCARECROW OR  INDEED  TWO  WHEN THE SUN COMES UP  SHE REASSURED ME  HER COMMITTEE CHECKS THE FAMILY FRIENDLINESS OF EVERY SCARECROWS POSE ITS WORTH NOTING THAT A VILLAGE OF EVEN THE MOST CHASTE SCARECROWS  IF NOT EXACTLY FRIGHTENING FOR THE NON CROWS IN YOUR PARTY  CAN NEVERTHELESS GET A BIT META I AM NOT A SCARECROW  READ ONE SIGN  EARLY IN THE EVENING OF MY LAST DAY IN KETTLEWELL AN OLDER GENTLEMAN POINTED RIGHT AT ME  WINKED  AND THEN SAID TO HIS FRIENDS  THAT ONES VERY LIFELIKE  ITD BEEN A LONG DAY FOR ME  FULL OF SCARECROWS  AND NOW IT WAS STARTING TO GET DARK  I SMILED BACK NERVOUSLY  BUTTONED UP THE STRAW FREE CUFFS OF MY FLANNEL SHIRT  AND DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO GO TO THE PUB  WHERE

20180505,entertainment,music,8,BEIJING  REGAL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC STRIKES UP  A COMPUTER ANIMATED TRAIN RACES BY AND AN OLD MAN WITH A BUSHY WHITE BEARD LOOMS ONTO THE TELEVISION SCREEN  THEN THE STUDIO AUDIENCE APPLAUDS AS AN EFFERVESCENT HOST OPENS AN EPISODE OF CHINAS LATEST PRIME TIME ENTERTAINMENT IT LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER CHINESE TALK SHOW  BUT THE BEARDED MAN IS KARL MARX  THIS IS MARX GOT IT RIGHT  A SLICKLY PRODUCED PROGRAM THAT IS PART TALK SHOW  PART INDOCTRINATION SESSION  AND A VIVID ILLUSTRATION OF THE QUIRKY EFFORTS THAT THE COMMUNIST PARTY UNDER XI JINPING IS MAKING TO WIN OVER CHINAS MILLENNIALS SATURDAY WAS THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF MARXS BIRTH  AND MR  XI  TRYING TO REASSERT THE COMMUNIST PARTYS DOMINANCE OVER AN INCREASINGLY COMPLEX SOCIETY  HAS USED THE OCCASION TO CALL FOR RENEWED DEVOTION TO THE FOUNDING TENETS OF COMMUNISM  HE GAVE A BIG SPEECH ON FRIDAY  DAYS AFTER VISITING PEKING UNIVERSITY  WHERE HE ALSO STRESSED MARXIST EDUCATION NO IDEA OR THEORY IN THE HISTORY OF HUMAN THOUGHT HAS PRODUCED A BROADER OR DEEPER IMPACT THAN MARXISM  MR  XI SAID TO THOUSANDS OF OFFICIALS IN THE GREAT HALL OF THE PEOPLE  HE CALLED MARX THE GREATEST THINKER IN MODERN TIMES MARX GOT IT RIGHT IS AMONG THE PARTYS ATTEMPTS TO IMPART THAT LESSON TO YOUNGER PEOPLE WHO GREW UP ABSORBED IN THEIR SMARTPHONES RATHER THAN THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO OR MAO ZEDONGS LITTLE RED BOOK FOR SOME  MARX IS JUST AN IMAGE OF SOMEONE WHO ALWAYS HAS A BIG BEARD  AND MARXISM IS JUST A BUNCH OF CONCEPTS OR A FEW EXAM QUESTIONS  WU XUELAN  THE SHOWS HOST  TOLD THE AUDIENCE OF CLEAN CUT STUDENTS  TODAY  I WANT TO ASK EVERYONE  DO YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND MARX AND MARXISM THE FIVE EPISODE SHOW RAN  RECENTLY ON CHINAS MAIN STATE RUN TELEVISION BROADCASTER  CHINA CENTRAL TELEVISION  AND HAS BEEN WIDELY PROMOTED ON COMMUNIST PARTY WEBSITES THE SHOW  PRODUCED WITH HELP FROM PROPAGANDA OFFICIALS  IS PART OF THE PARTYS STRATEGY TO PERSUADE TWENTY SOMETHINGS THAT THE MARXIST LENINIST LESSONS THEY STUDIED  OR DOZED THROUGH  IN SCHOOL STILL HOLD TRUE  CHINA  THE SHOW INSISTS  REMAINS LOYAL TO SOCIALISM  DESPITE HAVING AS MANY AS 800 OR MORE BILLIONAIRES  RISING HIGH TECH CONGLOMERATES AND GAPING INEQUALITIES STILL  EVEN THE STUDIO AUDIENCE OF POLITE PARTY LOYALISTS SEEMED DAUNTED BY EPISODE 3  THE IMMORTAL DAS KAPITAL  ABOUT MARXS FORBIDDING THREE VOLUME TREATISE ON THE WORKINGS OF CAPITALISM IM VERY HAPPY THAT SO MANY YOUNG FRIENDS FROM EVERYWHERE ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE HERE WITH US TO RELIVE IN STORIES THE ARDUOUS TIMES WHEN MARX COMPOSED DAS KAPITAL  SAID MS  WU  IN MODERN HUMAN HISTORY  MARXISM WILL COME TO THE FORE DURING EVERY GREAT CRISIS OR TURNING POINT  AND A CLASSIC INDICATOR OF THIS IS MARXS DAS KAPITAL WHEN MS  WU ASKED WHO HAD READ THE BOOK  ONE OR TWO HANDS POKED UP  BUT MS  WU HAD AN ANSWER FOR ANY STUDENTS WHO TOOK CAPITALISTS LIKE JACK MA OR STEVE JOBS AS THEIR HEROES AND NEEDED CONVINCING TO DIVE IN MEDIA REPORTS HAVE SAID THAT IF MARX WAS STILL ALIVE TODAY  HE WOULD BE A WEALTHY MAN FROM THE ROYALTIES FROM SALES OF DAS KAPITAL  SHE SAID LAUGHTER AND BANTER ARE RARE IN EACH EARNEST  33 MINUTE EPISODE  BUT THE SHOW USES CARTOONS AND FOLKSY EXAMPLES TO ARGUE THAT MARX DISCOVERED FUNDAMENTAL TRUTHS ABOUT HOW SOCIETIES EVOLVE  AND THAT CHINA REMAINS SHAPED BY MARXS EGALITARIAN IDEALS LEFT UNSAID IN THE PROGRAM  MEASURES OF WEALTH INEQUALITY IN CHINA HAVE NEARED LEVELS FOUND IN THE UNITED STATES  EVEN AS MR  XI COURTS GLOBAL CAPITALISTS AT DAVOS WHILE MR  XI HAS TRIED TO WOO FOREIGN INVESTORS  HE HAS ALSO TRIED CARVE A DISTINCTIVE IDEOLOGY  PART OLD SCHOOL COMMUNIST VALUES  PART EARTHY APPEALS TO ANCIENT CHINESE TRADITION  THAT INOCULATES CHINA FROM THE TUMULT OF FREE MARKETS AND LIBERAL DEMOCRACY  THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY THESE DAYS RARELY MENTIONS CLASS STRUGGLE  AND HAS EMBRACED MARKETS SINCE DENG XIAOPINGS ERA IN THE 1980S EVEN SO  LEADERS INSIST THAT CHINA STAYS ABOVE THE RUTHLESS RULES OF CAPITALISM  ABOVE ALL  THEY EMPHASIZE THAT MARXISM MEANS KEEPING THEIR ONE PARTY RULE I DONT THINK THAT THE TALK ABOUT MARXISM CAME ALL OF A SUDDEN  BUT THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS BIRTH IS A VERY IMPORTANT TIME FRAME AND THERE ARE MANY COMMEMORATIVE ACTIVITIES  WANG XINSHENG  A PROFESSOR OF MARXISM AT NANKAI UNIVERSITY IN NORTHERN CHINA  SAID  CHINAS MARKET ECONOMY IS ONE THAT USES MARKET ECONOMICS AS A TOOL TO REALIZE THE VALUES AND GOALS OF SOCIALISM MARX GOT IT RIGHT MAKES THAT POINT BY SHOWING THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2008  THE BITTER DIVISIONS OF AMERICAN POLITICS AND THE TUMULT OF BREXIT  WHILE SAYING THAT CHINA HAS REMAINED STABLE AND GROWING THANKS TO ONE PARTY SOCIALISM HELD TOGETHER BY THE IDEALS OF MARX I FEEL THAT CHINA NOW IS VERY SAFE  FULL OF VITALITY AND VERY PROSPEROUS  ONE STUDENT SAID  FOLLOWED BY OTHER STUDENTS PRAISING CHINAS GROWTH  INNOVATION AND STABILITY BY CONTRAST  THE SHOW BLAMES THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET BLOC ON REFORMIST POLITICIANS LIKE MIKHAIL S  GORBACHEV WHO ABANDONED MARXIST LENINIST ORTHODOXIES THE FAILURE OF THE SOVIET UNION AND EASTERN EUROPE WAS NOT THE FAILURE OF SCIENTIFIC SOCIALISM  JIANG HUI  A MARXIST SCHOLAR IN BEIJING  SAID ON THE SHOW  ON THE CONTRARY  IT WAS THEIR DEVIATION FROM MARXISM AND SCIENTIFIC SOCIALISM THAT LED TO THEIR FAILURE MARX GOT IT RIGHT BELONGS TO A SPATE OF CHINESE PROPAGANDA SPECTACLES AIMED AT YOUTH  ALTHOUGH THE RESULTS CAN FEEL FORCED  LAST YEAR  OFFICIALS IN SOUTHERN CHINA PRODUCED A SERIES CALLED SOCIALISM IS A BIT HIP  WHICH TRIED TO MIMIC THE ZANY GARISHNESS OF POP CULTURE  PARTY BACKED RAP GROUPS HAVE ALSO MADE PATRIOTIC SONGS WITH LYRICS SO PROFANE THEY SHOULD REQUIRE PARENTAL GUIDANCE WARNINGS OUTSIDE THE TIGHTLY SCRIPTED TELEVISION STUDIO  CHINESE PEOPLE HAVE VOICED MORE SKEPTICISM ABOUT MARX GOT IT RIGHT  ON ZHIHU  A POPULAR CHINESE WEBSITE FOR POSTING QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS  USERS MOCKED THE SHOWS CANNED APPLAUSE AND THE STILTED BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN STUDENTS AND PROFESSORS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IDEAS IN MARXISM IS TO DOUBT EVERYTHING  ONE COMMENT SAID  THIS WHOLE THING MADE MARX INTO A GREAT MAN  BUT MARX OPPOSED A CULT OF PERSONALITY  AS FOR THE

PLENTY OF WORK REMAINS TO BE DONE FOR WASHINGTON TO SHRUG OFF THE WEIGHT OF ITS IGNOMINIOUS HISTORY AND FOR THE PENGUINS TO PUSH THEIR BID FOR A THREE PEAT TO THE NEXT ROUND  YET PITTSBURGH LAID DOWN THE BLUEPRINT OVER THREE PERIODS THAT WERE DECIDEDLY TAMER THAN THE GAME 3 CHAOS CAUSED IN LARGE PART BY WASHINGTON FORWARD TOM WILSON S ILLEGAL HIGH HIT THAT LEFT ROOKIE ZACH ASTON REESE WITH A

20180505,politics,politics,1,WE IN THE COMMENTARIAT COMPLAIN ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP  BUT WERE LOCKED IN A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM NEWS ORGANIZATIONS  ESPECIALLY CABLE TELEVISION CHANNELS  FEED OFF TRUMP  LIKE OXPECKERS ON A RHINOS BACK  FOR HE IS PART OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL IN 2018  AS LONG AS OUR FOCUS IS ON TRUMP  AUDIENCES FOLLOW ITS NOT OPTIMAL TO HAVE AS PRESIDENT AN AUTHORITARIAN WHO DENOUNCES JOURNALISTS AS ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE  BUT HE HAS GIVEN US A SENSE OF MISSION AND A TRUMP BUMP  EVERY TIME HE DENOUNCES US WE GET MORE SUBSCRIPTIONS IF YOURE READING THIS  PRESIDENT TRUMP  ID APPRECIATE A GOOD  THUNDEROUS EXCORIATION  YOUVE GONE AFTER MAGGIE HABERMAN  DON LEMON AND CHUCK TODD  BUT YOUVE PUBLICLY DENOUNCED ME ONLY ONCE  AND SO INCOHERENTLY THAT I COULDNT PRINT OUT A QUOTE TO IMPRESS MY KIDS  NEXT TIME YOURE ON TWITTER  HOW ABOUT FIRING OFF SOMETHING CONCISE LIKE  CRACKPOT KRISITOFFF IS THE WORST LYING REPORTER AT THE FAILING NYTIMES EVER YET I WORRY THAT OUR NATIONAL NONSTOP FOCUS ON TRUMP IS HELPING TO USHER AMERICA INTO A HOLE  A TRUMP OBSESSION  THE DANGER IS THAT TRUMP SUCKS UP ALL THE OXYGEN  SO THAT OTHER ISSUES DONT GET ADEQUATE ATTENTION WHILE I HAVE YOU HERE  I WANTED TO REMIND YOU THAT YOU CAN SIGN UP FOR MY TWICE WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE IN AMERICA TODAY  ITS ALL TRUMP  ALL THE TIME  WERE COLLECTIVELY ADDICTED TO HIM  THE NONSTOP SCANDALS AND OUTRAGES SUCK US IN  THEY AMOUNT TO TRUMP PORN AS PRESIDENT  TRUMP IS ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT  BUT THERES SO MUCH ELSE HAPPENING AS WELL  SOME 65 000 AMERICANS WILL DIE THIS YEAR OF DRUG OVERDOSES  AMERICAN LIFE EXPECTANCY HAS FALLEN FOR TWO YEARS IN A ROW  GUNS CLAIM A LIFE EVERY 15 MINUTES AND THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED IS RISING AGAIN EVEN AS A CHILD IN THE U S  IS 70 PERCENT MORE LIKELY TO DIE BEFORE ADULTHOOD THAN ONE IN OTHER ADVANCED NATIONS  THOSE ISSUES ARE RATHER MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE QUESTION OF WHETHER STORMY DANIELS SLEPT WITH TRUMP OR LOOK ABROAD  IN MYANMAR  THE GOVERNMENT IS ENGAGING IN WHAT MANY BELIEVE TO BE A GENOCIDE AGAINST THE ROHINGYA MINORITY  GAZA IS ERUPTING  AND THERES HEIGHTENED THREAT OF A NEW WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST  THE U S  HAS BEEN COMPLICIT IN SAUDI ARABIAN WAR CRIMES IN YEMEN  THE CARNAGE IN SYRIA CONTINUES THE WORLDS PROGRESS AGAINST MALARIA  WHICH KILLS ALMOST ONE PERSON A MINUTE  HAS STALLED  A FIFTH OF CHILDREN UNDER 5 WORLDWIDE ARE STUNTED FROM MALNUTRITION  BILL GATES AND OTHERS WARN THAT ONE OF OUR TOP RISKS IS A PANDEMIC FOR WHICH WE ARE ILL PREPARED PROGRESSIVE SNOBS LIKE ME BEMOAN TRUMPS INATTENTION TO THESE GLOBAL ISSUES  BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT WE DONT PAY ATTENTION  EITHER  AT COCKTAIL PARTIES  ON CABLE TELEVISION  AT THE DINNER TABLE  AT THE WATER COOLER  ALL WE TALK ABOUT THESE DAYS IS TRUMP  SO WE COMPLAIN ABOUT TRUMP BEING INSULAR AND PAROCHIAL  BUT WEVE BECOME INSULAR AND PAROCHIAL AS WELL  WEVE CAUGHT THE CONTAGION THAT WE MOCK IM ADDICTED MYSELF  WHICH IS WHY I WRITE SO MUCH ABOUT TRUMP  OR CATCH MYSELF ON A DATE NIGHT WITH MY WIFE ENGAGING IN HORRIFIED CONVERSATION ABOUT TRUMP IN FAIRNESS  THERES GOOD REASON WERE ALL TRUMP ADDICTS  PRESIDENT TRUMP TRULY IS THE STORY IN AMERICA TODAY  HE IS SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERMINING AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS AND NORMS THAT UNDERLIE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT  COURTS  LAW ENFORCEMENT  JOURNALISM  THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY  TRUTH  HE IS ALSO BEING INVESTIGATED FOR POSSIBLY OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE AND COLLUDING WITH A FOREIGN POWERS ATTACK ON OUR ELECTORAL SYSTEM  EPIC BATTLES WILL FOLLOW TWO THOUSAND YEARS FROM NOW  HISTORIANS MAY BE LECTURING ON TRUMP THE WAY THEY NOW DISCUSS  SAY  THE CHALLENGE TO ROMAN INSTITUTIONS FROM CALIGULA SO IM NOT ARGUING THAT WE AVERT OUR EYES FROM TRUMP OR MUTE OUR CRITICISM  FAR FROM IT  BUT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SPARE BANDWIDTH FOR GENOCIDE IN MYANMAR  OPIOIDS IN AMERICA AND SO ON IT WOULD ALSO BE USEFUL IF WE RECOGNIZED THAT THE BIGGEST TRUMP SCANDALS ARE NOT WHAT HE SAYS  BUT WHAT HE DOES HIS TWEETS AGAINST IMMIGRANTS MAY BE CRUEL  BUT HIS ACTIONS ARE CRUELER  PARTICULARLY THE PATTERN OF TEARING CHILDREN AWAY FROM THEIR REFUGEE PARENTS AT THE BORDER AND SENDING THEM TO FOSTER CARE  AND HIS EFFORTS TO CURB REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH PROGRAMS  WHICH WILL LEAVE MORE WOMEN DYING AGONIZING DEATHS FROM CERVICAL CANCER  AND HIS LIFTING OF ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS  CAUSING MORE INFANTS IN FARM STATES TO SUFFER BRAIN DAMAGE FROM THE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANYS NERVE GAS PESTICIDE IN OTHER WORDS  THE BIGGEST TRUMP SCANDALS ARENT THOSE UNFOLDING IN WASHINGTON  BUT THOSE DEVASTATING THE LIVES OF THE POOR AND VULNERABLE IN DISTANT AMERICAN TOWNS THERES SOME DANGER  I THINK  THAT PROGRESSIVES COME TO CARE PRIMARILY ABOUT ISSUES WHERE TRUMP IS INVOLVED  ALLOWING HIM TO DEFINE THE AGENDA  FOR EXAMPLE  THE BEST SINGLE WAY TO BREAK CYCLES OF POVERTY IS PROBABLY WITH EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS FOR AT RISK KIDS  BUT BECAUSE TRUMP DOESNT CARE ABOUT THIS  LIBERALS DONT SEEM MUCH INTERESTED  EITHER  THATS PATHETIC WE CAN COVER TRUMP AND OTHER THINGS AS WELL  AND THE BEST EVIDENCE IS  METOO  THE  METOO CASCADE DREW ON ANGER AT HOW TRUMP PREVAILED EVEN AFTER BOASTING ABOUT SEXUALLY ASSAULTING WOMEN  BUT IT SHINED THE SPOTLIGHT ELSEWHERE AND HAD ASTONISHING CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE STILL REVERBERATING AROUND THE WORLD IN SHORT  THINK OF THIS AS A MULTIFRONT WAR  TRUMP IS MOUNTING ONE ASSAULT ON OUR VALUES  INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES  AND WE HAVE TO FIGHT BACK  BUT IF WE BATTLE ONLY ON THAT FRONT  WE ARE IN EFFECT SURRENDERING EVERYWHERE ELSE

20180501,politics,north korea,5,TOKYO  A BLISTERING PACE OF MEETINGS TO DISCUSS THE PROSPECTS FOR PEACE ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA WILL CONTINUE NEXT WEEK IN TOKYO  WHEN JAPAN HOSTS A MEETING WITH LEADERS FROM CHINA AND SOUTH KOREA PRIME MINISTER SHINZO ABE ANNOUNCED ON TUESDAY DURING A VISIT TO AMMAN  JORDAN  THAT HE WOULD HOST PRESIDENT MOON JAE IN OF SOUTH KOREA AND PREMIER LI KEQIANG OF CHINA IN TOKYO ON MAY 9 THE MEETING WOULD PUT JAPAN BACK INTO THE DIPLOMATIC FRAY AFTER IT HAD LOOKED INCREASINGLY ISOLATED  WITH THE PRIMARY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT NORTH KOREA PROGRESSING WITHOUT IT  MR  ABE HAD SPENT THE PAST YEAR CULTIVATING A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HEWING TO THE UNITED STATES HARD LINE APPROACH TO NORTH KOREA  ONLY TO BE CAUGHT BY SURPRISE WHEN MR  TRUMP ABRUPTLY ACCEPTED AN INVITATION TO TALK WITH THE NORTHS LEADER  KIM JONG UN A TRILATERAL SUMMIT IN TOKYO IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ABE TO REASSERT HIMSELF IN FAST MOVING REGIONAL POLITICS IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT DEPEND ON HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U S  PRESIDENT  SAID MIRA RAPP HOOPER  A SENIOR RESEARCH SCHOLAR AT YALE LAW SCHOOL WHO WRITES ABOUT SECURITY IN ASIA SPEAKING IN AMMAN  WHERE JAPAN ANNOUNCED GRANTS OF UP TO 1 63 BILLION YEN  ABOUT  MILLION  TO HELP JORDAN SUPPORT AN INFLUX OF SYRIAN REFUGEES  MR  ABE SAID HE PLANNED TO DISCUSS ALL ASPECTS OF THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN JAPAN AND CHINA  AND JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA AT THE MEETING NEXT WEEK  HE ADDED THAT HE WOULD PUSH FOR MORE CONCRETE ACTIONS FROM NORTH KOREA TO FLESH OUT THE COMMITMENT TO DENUCLEARIZATION THAT MR  KIM DISCUSSED WITH MR  MOON IN HISTORIC TALKS IN THE BORDER VILLAGE OF PANMUNJOM LAST FRIDAY OF THE THREE LEADERS CONVENING IN TOKYO NEXT WEEK  MR  ABE  WHO HAS LATELY BEEN DOGGED BY INFLUENCE PEDDLING SCANDALS AT HOME  IS PERHAPS MOST IN NEED OF A DOMESTIC BOOST  UNDOUBTEDLY  ALL THREE LEADERS WILL WANT TO TALK ABOUT ADVANCING THE NORTH KOREAN PEACE PROCESS  BUT THE UNUSUAL PERSONALITY AND STYLE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP IS AN EQUALLY URGENT TOPIC A LOT OF THE STIMULUS FOR THIS DIPLOMACY IN NORTHEAST ASIA IS CERTAINLY THE NORTH KOREAN THREAT  SAID MIREYA SOLIS  CO DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR EAST ASIA POLICY STUDIES AT THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION  BUT THEY ARE ALSO DEALING WITH THIS PRESIDENT  WHO IS IN SO MANY WAYS CHANGING THE PARAMETERS OF U S  FOREIGN POLICY THE MEETING WILL PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE THREE LEADERS TO DISCUSS COMMERCIAL TIES  AT A TIME WHEN THE UNITED STATES IS THREATENING A TRADE WAR WITH CHINA AND HAS RECENTLY RENEGOTIATED A TWO WAY TRADE AGREEMENT WITH SOUTH KOREA IT WILL BE THE FIRST VISIT TO JAPAN BY MR  MOON SINCE HE WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT LAST MAY  AND THE FIRST VISIT TO TOKYO BY A SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT IN MORE THAN SIX YEARS  MR  LI WOULD BE THE FIRST CHINESE PREMIER TO VISIT JAPAN IN EIGHT YEARS WITH THE REGIONS DYNAMICS SHIFTING RAPIDLY  MR  ABE WILL NOT BE IN THE DRIVERS SEAT  HE HAS BEEN LOOKING TO SECURE A MEETING WITH MR  LI IN THE HOPES OF VISITING BEIJING THIS SUMMER AND ULTIMATELY HOSTING PRESIDENT XI JINPING IN TOKYO BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR BUT CHINA HAS DRAGGED ITS FEET IN AGREEING TO SET DATES WHENEVER JAPAN WOULD CALL THEY WERE BASICALLY SAYING WELL  WELL CHECK OUR SCHEDULE BOOK AND GET BACK TO YOU  SAID J  BERKSHIRE MILLER  A SENIOR VISITING FELLOW AT THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS IN TOKYO AND SOUTH KOREA  WHICH HAD TYPICALLY BEEN A BACKSEAT PLAYER IN NORTHEAST ASIA  IS NOW EMERGING AS A LEADING BROKER OF THE NORTH KOREAN PEACE NEGOTIATIONS TRADITIONALLY IT WAS REALLY JAPAN AND CHINA LEADING  WITH SOUTH KOREA BEING THE SHRIMP BETWEEN TWO WHALES  MR  MILLER SAID  BUT NOW YOU HAVE THE SCENARIO WHERE  AFTER THE KIM MOON SUMMIT  BOTH SIDES WILL BE VERY ACTIVELY TALKING TO PRESIDENT MOON TO UNDERSTAND WHATS HAPPENING ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA  ITS AN INTERESTING CHANGE OF SCENARIO AT NEXT WEEKS SUMMIT  THE CHALLENGE FOR JAPAN IS TO ESTABLISH A SIGNIFICANT ROLE FOR ITSELF IN THE DIPLOMATIC GYRATIONS THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF TENSION IS REALLY WHAT ROLE JAPAN CAN PLAY IN THIS PROCESS  SAID TOBIAS HARRIS  AN EXPERT ON JAPANESE POLITICS AT TENEO INTELLIGENCE IN WASHINGTON  CHINA IS NORTH KOREAS BACKSTOP  AND THEY MIGHT NUDGE NORTH KOREA IN THE DIRECTION OF CONSTRUCTIVE CONCESSIONS THAT LOWER THE TEMPERATURE  OBVIOUSLY SOUTH KOREA IS PLAYING THIS ROLE OF DRAWING NORTH KOREA OUT AND ALMOST IN SOME WAYS SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF NORTH KOREA BEFORE MUCH OF THE WORLD  BUT ITS NOT QUITE CLEAR WHAT JAPANS ROLE IN ALL OF THIS IS GOING TO BE JAPAN CLEARLY HAS ITS OWN AGENDA OF ENSURING THAT MR  TRUMP DOES NOT AGREE TO A DEAL THAT WOULD ACCEPT NORTH KOREA GIVING UP INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILES AND FUTURE NUCLEAR TESTS WHILE RETAINING SHORT  AND MEDIUM RANGE MISSILES THAT COULD STILL HIT JAPAN IN TALKING WITH SOUTH KOREA AND CHINA  MR  ABE WILL WANT TO MAKE SURE HIS COUNTRY DOES NOT GET DRAGGED ALONG WITH RELAXING SANCTIONS BECAUSE ITS FACING PRESSURE FROM CHINA  SOUTH KOREA AND THE U S  TO PLAY A GOOD SPORT AND SUPPORT AN AGREEMENT WITHOUT PROTECTING JAPANS INTERESTS  MR  HARRIS SAID MR  ABE IS ALSO PARTICULARLY KEEN TO REACH SOME KIND OF RESOLUTION FOR THE FAMILIES OF  JAPANESE CITIZENS KIDNAPPED BY NORTH KOREAN SPIES FOUR DECADES AGO  AND WILL UNDOUBTEDLY REITERATE HIS REQUEST FOR SUPPORT FROM SOUTH KOREA AND IN HOPES OF CONTINUING A TREND TOWARD WARMER TIES WITH CHINA  MR  ABE WILL HOST SEPARATE ONE ON ONE TALKS WITH MR  LI DURING HIS VISIT TO TOKYO NEXT WEEK

20180502,politics,trump,2,ON MONDAY  THE TIMES GAVE US THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF 49 QUESTIONS THE SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER COULD ASK PRESIDENT TRUMP  AS TOLD TO MR  TRUMPS LEGAL TEAM DURING NEGOTIATIONS FOR AN INTERVIEW  THE QUESTIONS REVEAL THE TOPICS MR  MUELLER BELIEVES COULD LEAD TO POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR THE PRESIDENT AND HELP EXPLAIN WHY TRUMPS TEAM HAS URGED HIM NOT TO AGREE TO AN INTERVIEW LAST NIGHT  WE LEARNED THAT THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS WERE ACTUALLY CREATED BY A TRUMP LAWYER  JAY SEKULOW  HIS INTERPRETATION OF 16 SPECIFIC SUBJECTS PRESENTED BY MR  MUELLERS TEAM  MR  SEKULOW BROKE DOWN THE SUBJECTS AND SUBTOPICS INTO THE SEPARATE QUESTIONS  THIS EXPLAINS WHY MR  TRUMPS TEAM HAD THESE QUESTIONS  IT WOULD BE HIGHLY UNUSUAL FOR A PROSECUTOR TO GIVE A WITNESS QUESTIONS IN ADVANCE  BUT IT IS FAIRLY COMMON FOR A PROSECUTOR TO PREVIEW POTENTIAL TOPICS FOR A DEFENSE ATTORNEY BEFORE AN INTERVIEW  FOR THAT REASON  I THINK ITS FAIR TO ASSUME THAT MR  SEKULOWS QUESTIONS TRACK WHAT MR  MUELLERS TEAM WANTS TO COVER IN AN INTERVIEW MR  TRUMPS TEAM PLANS TO USE THE QUESTIONS TO ATTACK THE SPECIAL COUNSEL AS OVERREACHING AND GOING BEYOND HIS MANDATE  BUT THE QUESTIONS THEMSELVES SUGGEST THAT MR  MUELLER HAS CAREFULLY STAYED WITHIN HIS BOUNDS  THEY CONTAIN NOTHING ABOUT OBSCURE BUSINESS DEALS OR REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS  THE QUESTIONS FOCUS ON COORDINATION WITH RUSSIA  OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE AND TOPICS THAT HAVE BEEN COVERED AT LENGTH IN THE NEWS MEDIA  NONE OF THE TOPICS SHOULD HAVE COME AS A SURPRISE TO MR  TRUMPS TEAM  ASIDE FROM AN EXPLOSIVE QUESTION ABOUT EFFORTS BY THE FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN PAUL MANAFORT TO SEEK AID FROM THE KREMLIN  WHICH IS SQUARELY ABOUT COORDINATION WITH RUSSIA WHAT SHOULD CONCERN MR  TRUMPS TEAM IS HOW THE QUESTIONS ZERO IN ON MR  TRUMPS CRIMINAL LIABILITY  THEY LEAVE LITTLE DOUBT THAT MR  TRUMP IS IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY  PARTICULARLY REGARDING OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE  I CONCLUDED MONTHS AGO THAT MR  MUELLER WOULD LIKELY DETERMINE THAT THE PRESIDENT OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE  BUT THE QUESTIONS SHOW THAT MR  MUELLER HAS ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT HOW HE WOULD PROVE HIS CASE  THE QUERIES ASK ABOUT MR  TRUMPS STATE OF MIND WHEN HE FIRED JAMES COMEY  WHEN HE ERUPTED IN ANGER AT ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS FOR RECUSING HIMSELF AND WHEN HE CONSIDERED FIRING THE SPECIAL COUNSEL  THE QUESTIONS ARE INTENDED TO PROVE THE CASE AGAINST MR  TRUMP THROUGH HIS OWN WORDS BUT IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO COUNT THE NUMBER OF QUESTIONS FOCUSED ON OBSTRUCTION AND CONCLUDE THAT MR  MUELLERS INVESTIGATION OF THE PRESIDENT FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON THAT TOPIC  THE INQUIRIES ON TOPICS OTHER THAN OBSTRUCTION ARE BROAD  FOR EXAMPLE  THE QUESTION WHAT DISCUSSIONS DID YOU HAVE DURING THE CAMPAIGN REGARDING ANY MEETING WITH MR  PUTIN  ENCOMPASSES A LOT OF GROUND  YOU COULD ASK A SIMILAR BROAD QUESTION REGARDING THE COMEY FIRING  WHAT DISCUSSIONS DID YOU HAVE ABOUT OR WITH JAMES COMEY   AND COVER MUCH OF THE GROUND COVERED IN THE 18 QUESTIONS RELATED TO HIM THE FACT THAT THE QUESTIONS ON TOPICS OTHER THAN OBSTRUCTION ARE SO BROAD DOES NOT NECESSARILY SUGGEST THAT MR  MUELLER HAS LESS EVIDENCE REGARDING THOSE TOPICS  A MORE LIKELY POSSIBILITY IS THAT MR  MUELLER IS NOT WILLING TO TIP HIS HAND ON THOSE TOPICS BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE HE HAS REGARDING THEM HASNT BEEN EXTENSIVELY COVERED IN THE PRESS THE PRESIDENTS TEAM COULD HAVE GATHERED EVIDENCE OF OBSTRUCTION THEMSELVES  AS I DID  BECAUSE MR  TRUMPS TWEETS AND PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT MR  COMEY ARE WELL KNOWN  BUT IT WOULD BE MUCH HARDER FOR HIS TEAM TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT EVIDENCE MR  MUELLER HAS REGARDING THE TRUMP TOWER MEETING  AND MR  MUELLER WOULDNT WANT TO DISCLOSE WHAT HE KNOWS BEFORE THE INTERVIEW AGAIN  ITS WORTH REMEMBERING THAT MR  TRUMPS TEAM  NOT MR  MUELLER  REPORTEDLY DEVISED THESE QUESTIONS  MR  MUELLER MAY HAVE MERELY RESPONDED TO SPECIFIC INQUIRIES FROM THE TRUMP TEAM  AND THEY MIGHT HAVE ASKED ABOUT FEWER SPECIFIC EVENTS RELATED TO OTHER TOPICS IF MR  TRUMP DOES NOT AGREE TO AN INTERVIEW  MR  MUELLER IS REPORTEDLY CONSIDERING SUBPOENAING HIM TO TESTIFY BEFORE A GRAND JURY  THE PRESIDENTS LAWYERS ARE CONSIDERING WHETHER TO CHALLENGE MR  MUELLERS AUTHORITY TO SUBPOENA MR  TRUMP FOR AN INVESTIGATION OF POTENTIAL CRIMES HE COMMITTED WHILE IN OFFICE  NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER CHALLENGED A PROSECUTORS RIGHT TO SUBPOENA HIM TO TESTIFY IN COURT  ALTHOUGH BILL CLINTON RECEIVED A GRAND JURY SUBPOENA FOR HIS TESTIMONY  IT WAS WITHDRAWN AFTER HE AGREED TO AN INTERVIEW MR  TRUMPS CLAIM WOULD BE NOVEL  BUT THE SUPREME COURT DENIED RICHARD NIXONS CHALLENGE TO A SUBPOENA FOR DOCUMENTS AND TAPES AS WELL AS MR  CLINTONS REQUEST TO POSTPONE A CIVIL LAWSUIT DURING HIS PRESIDENCY  THE SUPREME COURT WOULD LIKELY RULE AGAINST MR  TRUMP  BUT HE COULD USE THE CHALLENGE TO DELAY MR  MUELLERS INVESTIGATION AND HIS OWN TESTIMONY  WHICH EXPLAINS WHY MR  MUELLER IS TRYING TO NEGOTIATE A VOLUNTARY INTERVIEW WHAT IS HARDEST TO KNOW IS WHY MR  MUELLER IS SEEKING AN INTERVIEW OF MR  TRUMP AT WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN EARLY STAGE OF THE INVESTIGATION  TYPICALLY PROSECUTORS WAIT UNTIL THE END OF AN INVESTIGATION TO INTERVIEW THEIR MOST IMPORTANT WITNESS  BECAUSE THEY UNCOVER ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE AS THE INVESTIGATION PROGRESSES  SO DOES THIS MEAN THAT MR  MUELLERS INVESTIGATION IS WRAPPING UP SOON  OR DOES IT MEAN THAT HE IS CONSIDERING SPLITTING HIS INVESTIGATION INTO PHASES  WITH A REPORT AT THE END OF EACH PHASE  IM SKEPTICAL THAT HELL DO THAT  WHAT IF HE UNCOVERS NEW EVIDENCE IN PHASE 2 THAT CHANGES HIS VIEW OF SOMETHING HE INVESTIGATED IN PHASE 1 THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION FOR THE EARLY INTERVIEW IS THAT MR  MUELLER THINKS HIS CHANCES OF GETTING THE PRESIDENT TO AGREE TO AN INTERVIEW WILL DECREASE OVER TIME  MR  TRUMP COULD AT SOME POINT DECIDE TO TAKE THE FIFTH TO AVOID TESTIMONY  DESPITE ANY POLITICAL DOWNSIDE THE POTENTIAL QUESTIONS WE SAW THIS WEEK EXPLAIN WHY MR  TRUMP IS SO CONCERNED ABOUT HIS CRIMINAL LIABILITY  HE FACES DIFFICULT QUESTIONS  NOT JUST ABOUT OBSTRUCTION BUT ALSO ABOUT A HOST OF TOPICS RELATED TO COORDINATION WITH RUSSIA  AND HIS LAWYERS APPEAR CONVINCED THAT HE CANNOT ANSWER THEM WITHOUT PUTTING HIMSELF IN FURTHER JEOPARDY
20180502,politics,election,10,WASHINGTON  PRESIDENT TRUMP PLUNGED INTO AN ANGRY DISPUTE ON WEDNESDAY BETWEEN CONSERVATIVE HOUSE REPUBLICANS AND THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL  SIDING WITH HARD LINE LAWMAKERS OVER HIS OWN JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AS THEY PRESSED FOR ACCESS TO SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE SPECIAL COUNSELS INVESTIGATION AND OTHER POLITICALLY CHARGED CASES IN A TWITTER POST  MR  TRUMP CALLED THE LEGAL SYSTEM RIGGED AND AMPLIFIED THE LAWMAKERS COMPLAINTS THAT THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL  ROD J  ROSENSTEIN  WAS NOT MOVING FAST ENOUGH TO TURN OVER THE DOCUMENTS THEY WANT  THE PRESIDENT STEPPED IN JUST AS MR  ROSENSTEIN APPEARED TO MOLLIFY THREE KEY COMMITTEE CHAIRMEN WHO WERE ALSO DEMANDING INTERNAL DOCUMENTS THEY DONT WANT TO TURN OVER DOCUMENTS TO CONGRESS  WHAT ARE THEY AFRAID OF  WHY SO MUCH REDACTING  WHY SUCH UNEQUAL JUSTICE  MR  TRUMP WROTE  AT SOME POINT I WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO USE THE POWERS GRANTED TO THE PRESIDENCY AND GET INVOLVED  WHICH PRESIDENTIAL POWERS MR  TRUMP WAS REFERRING TO WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY CLEAR DISTRUST BETWEEN MR  ROSENSTEIN AND CONGRESS HAS BEEN BUILDING OVER MONTHS  IN RECENT WEEKS  HE HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT GESTURES TO RELEASE DOCUMENTS DEMANDED BY PROMINENT CONGRESSMEN  ONLY TO BE THREATENED WITH IMPEACHMENT BY LAWMAKERS FROM THE FAR RIGHT MR  ROSENSTEIN RESPONDED ON TUESDAY TO THAT THREAT BY DECLARING THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WOULD NOT BE EXTORTED OFFICIALS AT THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVE THAT THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE NOW GONE TOO FAR WITH DOCUMENT REQUESTS RELATED TO CONTINUING INVESTIGATIONS THAT THE LAWMAKERS CLEARLY DO NOT SUPPORT  INCLUDING THE INQUIRY LED BY THE SPECIAL COUNSEL  ROBERT S  MUELLER III  INTO RUSSIAS ELECTION INTERFERENCE  A FORMER FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL FAMILIAR WITH THE DEPARTMENTS VIEWS SAID THAT MR  ROSENSTEIN AND TOP F B I  OFFICIALS HAVE COME TO SUSPECT THAT SOME LAWMAKERS WERE USING THEIR OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY TO GAIN INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THAT INVESTIGATION SO THAT IT COULD BE SHARED WITH THE WHITE HOUSE MR  TRUMPS THREAT ON WEDNESDAY TO INTERVENE BOLSTERED THOSE VOICES AND COULD UNDERMINE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS ABILITY TO PROTECT SOME OF ITS MOST CLOSELY HELD SECRETS  LAWMAKERS CONDUCTING OVERSIGHT ARE USUALLY GIVEN SUMMARIES OF THE INFORMATION  BUT NOT THE INTELLIGENCE COLLECTED DIRECTLY FROM WIRETAPS AND SENSITIVE SOURCES SIMILAR STANDOFFS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AND CONGRESS HAVE RESULTED IN COMPROMISE DATING BACK DECADES  BUT IN THOSE CASES  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAD THE SUPPORT OF THE PRESIDENT  WITHOUT MR  TRUMPS SUPPORT  CONGRESS IS GAINING THE ADVANTAGE REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS  FOR THEIR PART  ARGUE THAT MR  ROSENSTEINS DEPARTMENT HAS SLOW WALKED IMPORTANT REQUESTS AND WITHHELD CRUCIAL DETAILS FROM DOCUMENTS THEY DO TURN OVER  MATERIAL THEY SAY IS NECESSARY TO DOING THEIR JOBS  AND THEIR THREATS ARE HARDLY VEILED DESPITE HIS REPEATED PROMISES TO COOPERATE  MR  ROSENSTEINS SUPERVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS BEEN SORELY INADEQUATE  SAID REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS  REPUBLICAN OF NORTH CAROLINA AND ONE OF MR  ROSENSTEINS MOST OUTSPOKEN ANTAGONISTS  VALID INVESTIGATIVE REQUESTS FROM CONGRESS HAVE BEEN SLOW WALKED  STONEWALLED AND IMPEDED AT EACH STEP OF THE WAY UNDER HIS WATCH HE ADDED  IF MR  ROSENSTEINS HESITANCE TO PRODUCE DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION TO CONGRESS REPRESENTED AN EFFORT TO SAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FROM EMBARRASSMENT  IT IS TOO LATE MR  ROSENSTEIN  AWARE OF THE THREATS AGAINST HIM  HAS TAKEN UNUSUAL STEPS TO TRY TO MEET THE DEMANDS  ADDING EMPLOYEES TO REVIEW THE REQUESTED FILES AND SHARING UNREDACTED DOCUMENTS NORMALLY OFF LIMITS TO CONGRESS  INCLUDING MEMOS DRAFTED BY THE FORMER F B I  DIRECTOR JAMES B  COMEY ABOUT HIS INTERACTIONS WITH MR  TRUMP  THE DEPARTMENT HAS EVEN SET UP OFFICE SPACE AT ITS HEADQUARTERS FOR CONGRESSIONAL STAFF MEMBERS AND LAWMAKERS TO REVIEW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS ALREADY STUDIED BY THE DEPARTMENTS INSPECTOR GENERAL  ACCORDING TO A DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THOSE EFFORTS HAVE PLACATED POWERFUL REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE CHAIRMEN AFTER REPRESENTATIVE DEVIN NUNES OF CALIFORNIA  THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE  THREATENED LAST MONTH TO HOLD MR  ROSENSTEIN IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS OR PROCEED WITH IMPEACHMENT  MR  ROSENSTEIN GAVE HIM ACCESS TO AN ALMOST COMPLETELY UNREDACTED F B I  MEMO ON THE OPENING OF THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION AND WON HIS THANKS HE REACHED AN AGREEMENT LAST WEEK WITH THE TWO REPUBLICANS WHO RUN THE COMMITTEES THAT CONDUCT OVERSIGHT OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  REPRESENTATIVES ROBERT W  GOODLATTE OF VIRGINIA AND TREY GOWDY OF SOUTH CAROLINA  TO SATISFY THE LAST OF THEIR DEMANDS FOR DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE INVESTIGATION INTO HILLARY CLINTONS EMAILS AND OTHER DECISIONS RELATED TO THE RUSSIA CASE BUT THOSE COMPROMISES MAY HAVE ONLY EMBOLDENED MR  TRUMPS FIERCEST ALLIES  INCLUDING MR  MEADOWS  THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HARD LINE HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS  AND REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN OF OHIO  A FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE CAUCUS  IN AN UNUSUAL SHOW OF DEFIANCE  BOTH MEN HAVE INSISTED THAT THE AGREEMENT WITH THE CHAIRMEN OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY AND HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH AND THAT THEY NEED ACCESS TO AN UNREDACTED VERSION OF AN AUGUST 2017 MEMO OUTLINING THE SCOPE OF MR  MUELLERS INVESTIGATION DEMOCRATS FEAR THAT THE REPUBLICAN REQUESTS  MANY OF WHICH CALL ON THE DEPARTMENT TO IGNORE LONGSTANDING POLICY ABOUT WHAT IT SHARES WITH CONGRESS  ARE MEANT AS A TRAP  EITHER MR  ROSENSTEIN CAN TURN OVER INFORMATION THAT COULD BE USED TO UNDERMINE THE SPECIAL COUNSELS INQUIRY  OR HE COULD REFUSE  GIVING MR  TRUMP COVER  OR EVEN CAUSE  TO FIRE THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL REPRESENTATIVE JERROLD NADLER OF NEW YORK  THE TOP DEMOCRAT ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE  SAID THE LATEST REPUBLICAN EFFORTS WERE CLEARLY TRYING TO SABOTAGE MR  MUELLERS INVESTIGATION AND COURT A CONFRONTATION WITH MR  ROSENSTEIN ALL OF THIS NOISE IS AIMED AT UNDERMINING THE SPECIAL COUNSELS WORK AS THE INVESTIGATION CLOSES IN ON THE PRESIDENT  MR  NADLER SAID IN A STATEMENT  THE PRESIDENTS ATTACKS ON THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE GROW MORE PARANOID BY THE DAY  THE CASE FOR OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE  AND THE COMPLICITY OF THESE HOUSE REPUBLICANS  GROWS DAY BY DAY AS WELL MR  ROSENSTEIN  WHO HAS ALREADY GIVEN THE REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS ACCESS TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS  HAS MADE CLEAR IN RECENT DAYS THAT HE DOES NOT INTEND TO GO FURTHER ON MONDAY  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WROTE TO MR  MEADOWS AND MR  JORDAN TO DENY THEM ACCESS TO THE DOCUMENT ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THE RUSSIA INQUIRY  CITING DEPARTMENT POLICY AGAINST SHARING INFORMATION ON A CONTINUING INVESTIGATION THE DEPARTMENT RECOGNIZES THE KEEN INTEREST THAT CONGRESS HAS IN THE SPECIAL COUNSELS INVESTIGATION  BUT  RESPECTFULLY  WE MUST ADHERE TO THE LONGSTANDING POSITION OF THE DEPARTMENT THAT CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRIES PERTAINING TO ONGOING CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS THREATEN THE INTEGRITY OF THOSE INVESTIGATIONS  STEPHEN E  BOYD  AN ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL  WROTE IN THE LETTER  A COPY OF WHICH WAS PROVIDED TO THE NEW YORK TIMES WE HOPE YOU CAN RESPECT OUR POSITION  HE ADDED AND ON TUESDAY  MR  ROSENSTEIN  REACTING TO REPORTS THAT MR  MEADOWS HAD DRAFTED ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT TO USE AGAINST HIM IF NEEDED  PUSHED BACK HARD IF WE WERE TO JUST OPEN OUR DOORS TO ALLOW CONGRESS TO COME AND RUMMAGE THROUGH THE FILES  THAT WOULD BE A SERIOUS INFRINGEMENT ON THE SEPARATION OF POWERS  MR  ROSENSTEIN SAID AT AN EVENT IN WASHINGTON  IT MIGHT RESOLVE A DISPUTE TODAY  BUT IT WOULD HAVE NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS IN THE LONG RUN  AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DEFEND THE INSTITUTION IT IS UNUSUAL FOR RANK AND FILE MEMBERS OF A COMMITTEE TO CHALLENGE OR MANEUVER AROUND THEIR OWN CHAIRMEN ON SENSITIVE MATTERS  BUT MR  JORDAN AND MR  MEADOWS ARE KNOWN AS TWO OF THE MOST CONFRONTATIONAL REPUBLICANS IN THE CHAMBER  MR  MEADOWS HAS DEVELOPED A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH MR  TRUMP  WHILE CONSERVATIVES ARE TALKING UP MR  JORDAN AS A CANDIDATE TO SUCCEED REPRESENTATIVE PAUL D  RYAN AS SPEAKER NEITHER LAWMAKER RESPONDED ON WEDNESDAY TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT IN AN APPARENT BREAK WITH BOTH MEN  MR  GOWDY  CHAIRMAN OF THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE  SAID ON WEDNESDAY THAT HE WAS SATISFIED THAT HIS COMMITTEE AND THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE NOW HAD THE ACCESS IT NEEDED TO DOCUMENTS RELEVANT TO A CONTINUING JOINT INVESTIGATION INTO DECISIONS MADE BY THE DEPARTMENT IN 2016 AND 2017 I APPRECIATE ROSENSTEINS WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEES  AND I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN HIS LEADERSHIP  MR  GOWDY SAID  ADDING THAT MR  MUELLER SHOULD BE GIVEN THE TIME  THE INDEPENDENCE AND THE RESOURCES TO CONDUCT A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION MR  TRUMP  WHO HAS PRIVATELY FUMED ABOUT MR  ROSENSTEIN  HAS SAID PUBLICLY THAT THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL FACED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST  THE PRESIDENT CRITICIZED MR  ROSENSTEIN FOR SIGNING A SEARCH WARRANT APPLICATION TO PERMIT FEDERAL AGENTS TO EAVESDROP ON ONE OF MR  TRUMPS FORMER CAMPAIGN AIDES MR  ROSENSTEIN ASSUMED OVERSIGHT OF THE INVESTIGATION AND APPOINTED MR  MUELLER AS SPECIAL COUNSEL AFTER THE ATTORNEY GENERAL  JEFF SESSIONS  RECUSED HIMSELF LAST YEAR  MR  TRUMP HAS REPEATEDLY ATTACKED MR  SESSIONS FOR HIS RECUSAL THE PRESIDENTS WARNING ON WEDNESDAY WAS A SHARP DEPARTURE FROM EARLIER COMMENTS  WHEN HE HAS SAID THAT ALTHOUGH HE IS FRUSTRATED WITH THE INVESTIGATION INTO HIS CAMPAIGN  HE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE INVOLVED WITH DEPARTMENT MATTERS I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO BE INVOLVED WITH THE F B I  MR  TRUMP SAID IN AN INTERVIEW IN NOVEMBER  IM NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THE KIND OF THINGS THAT I WOULD LOVE TO BE DOING  AND IM VERY FRUSTRATED BY IT BUT MR  TRUMP IS INCREASINGLY ON THE DEFENSIVE  AFTER AN F B I  RAID OF THE OFFICE AND HOTEL ROOM OF HIS PERSONAL LAWYER  MICHAEL D  COHEN  AND THE DISCLOSURE OF MORE THAN 40 QUESTIONS THAT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL WOULD LIKE HIM TO ANSWER  THE QUESTIONS TOUCH ON A VARIETY OF TOPICS  INCLUDING COORDINATION WITH THE RUSSIANS DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AND ACTIONS THAT MR  TRUMP HAS TAKEN AS PRESIDENT AND WHETHER THEY WERE INTENDED TO DERAIL THE INQUIRY

20180502,politics,trump,9,GLENDALE  ARIZ   THE LATEST WAVE OF FOREIGN WORKERS SWEEPING INTO AMERICAN JOBS BROUGHT DONATO SOBERANO FROM THE PHILIPPINES TO ARIZONA TWO YEARS AGO  HE HAD TO PAY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO A JOB BROKER AND LIVED FOR A TIME IN AN APARTMENT WITH FIVE OTHER FILIPINO WORKERS  THE LURE IS THE PAY  10 TIMES MORE THAN WHAT HE MADE DOING THE SAME WORK BACK HOME BUT MR  SOBERANO IS NOT A HOSPITALITY WORKER OR A HOME HEALTH AIDE  HE IS IN ANOTHER LINE OF WORK THAT INCREASINGLY PAYS TOO LITTLE TO ATTRACT ENOUGH AMERICANS  MR  SOBERANO IS A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER AS WALKOUTS BY TEACHERS PROTESTING LOW PAY AND EDUCATION FUNDING SHORTFALLS SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY  THE SMALL BUT GROWING MOVEMENT TO RECRUIT TEACHERS FROM OVERSEAS IS ANOTHER SIGN OF THE DIFFICULTY SOME DISTRICTS ARE HAVING PROVIDING THE BASICS TO PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS AMONG THE LATEST STATES HIT BY THE PROTESTS IS ARIZONA  WHERE TEACHER PAY IS MORE THAN  000 BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF  000 PER YEAR  THE PENDERGAST ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT  WHERE MR  SOBERANO WORKS  HAS RECRUITED MORE THAN 50 TEACHERS FROM THE PHILIPPINES SINCE 2015  THEY HOLD J 1 VISAS  WHICH ALLOW THEM TO WORK TEMPORARILY IN THE UNITED STATES  LIKE AU PAIRS OR CAMP COUNSELORS  BUT OFFER NO PATH TO CITIZENSHIP  MORE THAN 2 800 FOREIGN TEACHERS ARRIVED ON AMERICAN SOIL LAST YEAR THROUGH THE J 1  ACCORDING TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT  UP FROM ABOUT 1 200 IN 2010 IN THESE TIMES  YOU HAVE TO BE INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE IN RECRUITING  SAID PATRICIA DAVIS TUSSEY  PENDERGASTS HEAD OF HUMAN RESOURCES  WE EMBRACE DIVERSITY AND REALLY GAIN A LOT FROM THE CULTURAL EXCHANGE EXPERIENCE  OUR STUDENTS DO AS WELL THE DISTRICT  WHICH COVERS PARTS OF GLENDALE  AVONDALE AND NORTH PHOENIX  IS A HOTBED OF ACTIVISM IN THE TEACHER WALKOUT MOVEMENT  KNOWN AS  REDFORED  PICKETING EDUCATORS SAY THEY HAVE HAD TO MOVE IN WITH THEIR PARENTS  APPLY FOR FOOD STAMPS AND PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR CLASSROOM ESSENTIALS LIKE GRAPH PAPER AND SCIENCE SUPPLIES  THEY ARGUE THAT TAXES ARE TOO LOW TO ADEQUATELY FUND SCHOOLS  OR FOR TEACHERS TO SECURE A MIDDLE CLASS LIFESTYLE IN RESPONSE TO THE TEACHER WALKOUT  REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS INTRODUCED A BUDGET THAT PROVIDES NEW FUNDING FOR SALARIES AND CLASSROOMS  BUT LEADERS OF THE  REDFORED MOVEMENT SAID THE BILL FELL FAR SHORT OF THEIR DEMANDS  AND WOULD RESTORE ONLY ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE  1 BILLION IN ANNUAL CUTS THAT THEY SAY SCHOOLS HAVE WEATHERED SINCE THE LAST RECESSION READ  TEACHER STRIKES ARE ILLEGAL IN MANY OF THE WALKOUT STATES  THAT HASNT STOPPED EDUCATORS IN PENDERGAST  WHERE SALARIES OF AROUND  000 ARE A SOURCE OF PAIN AND PROTEST FOR THE DISTRICTS AMERICAN EDUCATORS  MR  SOBERANO IS THANKFUL FOR THE PAY MUCH LIKE OTHER FOREIGN WORKERS  HE WENT INTO DEBT TO FIND A JOB IN THE UNITED STATES  HE SAID HE USED SAVINGS AND A BANK LOAN TO PAY  500  ABOUT THREE YEARS WORTH OF HIS SALARY IN THE PHILIPPINES  TO PETRO FIL MANPOWER SERVICES  THAT IS A FILIPINO COMPANY OF LIGAYA AVENIDA  A CALIFORNIA BASED CONSULTANT WHO RECRUITS AND SCREENS TEACHERS FOR THE J 1 THE PAYMENT COVERED MR  SOBERANOS AIRFARE AND RENT FOR HIS FIRST FEW MONTHS IN ARIZONA  AS WELL

SACRIFICES TO LEAVE YOUR FAMILY WAY BACK HOME  MR  SOBERANO SAID  EVERY NIGHT  HE PREPARES LESSONS FOR HIS SEVENTH  AND EIGHTH GRADE SCIENCE STUDENTS  AND EVERY MORNING  HE WAKES UP AT 4 A M  TO VIDEO CHAT WITH HIS WIFE AND TWO TEENAGE DAUGHTERS  WHO ARE ENDING THEIR DAY IN MANILA  DESPITE THEIR SEPARATION  HE SAID THE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN REWARDING  TEACHING IN A DIFFERENT CULTURE  BUT ALSO  FINANCIALLY THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT RECRUIT TEACHERS LIKE MR  SOBERANO SAY THAT THEY HAVE FEW OTHER OPTIONS  BECAUSE THEY CANT FIND ENOUGH AMERICAN EDUCATORS WILLING TO WORK FOR THE PAY THATS OFFERED  THEY SAY THAT THE FOREIGN TEACHERS ARE BEING GIVEN VALUABLE OPPORTUNITIES  AND THAT AMERICAN STUDENTS ARE ENRICHED BY LEARNING FROM THEM  BUT CRITICS ARGUE THE TEACHERS ARE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF IN A PRACTICE THAT HELPS KEEP WAGES LOW AND PERPETUATES YEARSLONG AUSTERITY POLICIES READ  WHY ARE TEACHERS WALKING OUT  WHATS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A WALKOUT AND A STRIKE THOUGH J 1 TEACHERS ACCOUNT FOR ONLY A TINY SHARE OF ARIZONAS 60 000 PUBLIC SCHOOLTEACHERS  INTERNATIONAL RECRUITMENT HAS SPREAD QUICKLY IN RECENT YEARS  AS SPONSOR COMPANIES MARKET THEMSELVES TO DISTRICTS FACING SHORTAGES AND WORD SPREADS AMONG ADMINISTRATORS  ACCORDING TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT  183 ARIZONA TEACHERS WERE GRANTED NEW J 1 VISAS LAST YEAR  UP FROM 17 IN 2010 RATHER THAN INCREASE SALARIES  DISTRICTS MAY ONCE AGAIN RESORT TO RECRUITING INTERNATIONALLY AS A WAY TO SOLVE THE TEACHER SHORTAGE  RANDI WEINGARTEN  PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS  A NATIONAL TEACHERS UNION  SAID IN A STATEMENT  SHE ADDED THAT WHILE HER UNION WILL FIGHT FOR EVERYONE WORKING IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND EDUCATING OUR KIDS TO HAVE FAIR WAGES  RIGHTS AND WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEYRE FROM  THE USE OF THE J 1 VISA PROGRAM TO FILL LONG TERM SHORTAGES IS AN ABUSE OF AN EXCHANGE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS AND RESEARCHERS SAY EXPERIENCED FOREIGN EDUCATORS CAN BE A BETTER OPTION FOR STUDENTS THAN THE SUBSTITUTES WHO WOULD OTHERWISE FILL THESE POSITIONS  BUT RESEARCH IS CLEAR THAT TEACHER CHURN NEGATIVELY IMPACTS ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT  J 1 TEACHERS ARE  BECAUSE OF THE VISAS LIMITATIONS  TEMPORARY  AND WITHOUT HIGHER PAY AND REGULAR RAISES  ADMINISTRATORS IN THESE DISTRICTS SAY IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ATTRACT ENOUGH AMERICAN TEACHERS AND KEEP THEM IN THE CLASSROOM  RECRUITING IN MANILADURING THE RECESSION  DISTRICTS FOUND IT EASIER TO HIRE AMERICAN WORKERS  SINCE MORE OF THEM WERE LOOKING TO TEACH  BUT AS THE ECONOMY PICKED BACK UP  HIRING BECAME DIFFICULT IN STATES LIKE ARIZONA  WHICH HAVE PURSUED YEARS OF TAX CUTS THAT HAVE DAMPENED SCHOOL BUDGETS AND TEACHER PAY  THE PENDERGAST DISTRICT HAS LOST  6 MILLION OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS BECAUSE OF STATE AND LOCAL CUTS  ACCORDING TO ADMINISTRATORS THE SUPERINTENDENT  LILY MATOS DEBLIEUX  HAS SOUGHT PRIVATE DONATIONS TO FUND A SPANISH ENGLISH DUAL LANGUAGE PROGRAM  A MONTHLY LUNCH DISCUSSION TO HELP PARENTS NAVIGATE THEIR CHILDRENS EDUCATION AND MANY OTHER EFFORTS  WITH THE LITTLE WE HAVE  WE HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB  SHE SAID BUT HIRING REMAINS A CHALLENGE  EVEN WITH 48 J 1 VISA HOLDERS

DISTRICT STAFF MEMBERS HAVE TRAVELED TO MANILA SEVERAL TIMES SINCE 2015 TO INTERVIEW TEACHERS  MR  SOBERANO MET WITH THE DISTRICT THERE IN JUNE 2016  AND JUST TWO MONTHS LATER  ARRIVED IN ARIZONA TO

SENSE  MS  DAVIS TUSSEY SAID  MANY SHORT STAFFED SCHOOLS TURN TO TEACH FOR AMERICA  WHICH RECRUITS RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATES AND CAREER CHANGERS FOR TWO YEAR STINTS IN THE CLASSROOM  BUT TO HIRE A TEACH FOR AMERICA RECRUIT  WHO MAY HAVE NO TEACHING EXPERIENCE OR COURSEWORK IN EDUCATION  THE DISTRICT MUST PAY  000 PER TEACHER  IN ADDITION TO SALARIES FOR A SIMILAR AMOUNT  A SINGLE TRIP TO THE PHILIPPINES CAN NET DOZENS OF CANDIDATES  ALL OF WHOM  AS REQUIRED BY THE J 1 PROGRAM  HAVE DEGREES IN EDUCATION OR THE SUBJECTS THEY TEACH  AND AT LEAST TWO YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN A FILIPINO SCHOOL MR  SOBERANO HOLDS ONE BACHELORS DEGREE IN EDUCATION  WITH A FOCUS ON PHYSICS  AND ANOTHER IN PHILOSOPHY  HE HAS ALSO STUDIED THEOLOGY  HE HAS OVER 20 YEARS OF CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE MUKUL BAKHSHI  DIRECTOR OF THE ALLIANCE FOR ETHICAL INTERNATIONAL RECRUITMENT PRACTICES  IN PHILADELPHIA  SAID THE PHILIPPINES PURPOSEFULLY TRAINS TEACHERS  NURSES AND OTHER WORKERS IN A WAY THAT ITS EASY FOR THEM TO PASS MUSTER FROM LICENSING AUTHORITIES HERE  THEY OBVIOUSLY SPEAK ENGLISH  AND THEY ARE WILLING TO WORK  REMITTANCES FROM FOREIGN WORKERS ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 10 PERCENT OF THE PHILIPPINES GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT THE PENDERGAST DISTRICT DID NOT OWE ANY MONEY TO THE COMPANIES THAT CONNECTED IT WITH RECRUITS IN MANILA  THOSE COSTS WERE BORNE BY THE FILIPINO TEACHERS JAMES BELL  PRESIDENT OF ALLIANCE ABROAD  THE VISA SPONSOR  SAID A FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT LIKE MR  SOBERANOS IS JUST ONE OF SEVERAL MODELS THE COMPANY USES  AND THAT IN SOME CASES  SCHOOL DISTRICTS PAY VISA3 5 RENEWAL FEES  ALLIANCE ABROAD SPONSORS SEVERAL HUNDRED J 1 VISA HOLDERS EACH YEAR  ACCORDING TO MR  BELL  WORKING PRIMARILY IN ARIZONA  CALIFORNIA  NEVADA  TEXAS AND UTAH  HE SAID THE BIGGEST DEMAND WAS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS  THOUGH DISTRICTS ALSO LOOKED TO HIRE IN SCIENCE  MATH AND FOREIGN LANGUAGES IN GILA BEND  A SMALL TOWN 70 MILES SOUTHWEST OF PHOENIX  11 FILIPINO TEACHERS WHO ROOM TOGETHER IN SEVERAL SHARED APARTMENTS COMMUTE TO WORK BY VAN 100 MILES ROUND TRIP EACH DAY  ACCORDING TO PEGGY PERRY  A SECRETARY IN THE DISTRICTS CENTRAL OFFICE  IN CASA GRANDE  HALFWAY BETWEEN PHOENIX AND TUCSON  ABOUT 25 FILIPINO TEACHERS WITH J 1 VISAS ARE TEACHING SCIENCE  MATH  SPECIAL EDUCATION AND ENGLISH  SAID MARY ANN AMERSON  HEAD OF HUMAN RESOURCES FOR THE CASA GRANDE UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT THE DISTRICT WORKS WITH MS  AVENIDA  THE CALIFORNIA BASED CONSULTANT  TO FIND THE TEACHERS AND INTERVIEW THEM VIA SKYPE  WE DONT PAY ANY MONEY FOR IT  MS  AMERSON SAID  THE RECRUITS PAY THE FEES MS  AVENIDA SAID HER COMPANY  WHICH USES THE NAME AVENIDA INTERNATIONAL CONSULTANTS IN THE UNITED STATES  RECRUITED 250 FILIPINO TEACHERS WITH J 1 VISAS IN 2017  ACCORDING TO STATE DEPARTMENT DATA  THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN HALF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF J 1 VISA HOLDERS WHO ARRIVED FROM THE PHILIPPINES LAST YEAR MS  AVENIDA JOINED UNION REPRESENTATIVES IN A WORKING GROUP  ASSEMBLED BY THE ALLIANCE FOR ETHICAL INTERNATIONAL RECRUITMENT PRACTICES  THAT DRAFTED A 2015 CODE OF CONDUCT FOR INTERNATIONAL TEACHER RECRUITMENT  THE CODE CALLS FOR DISTRICTS TO BEAR ALL RECRUITMENT AND LEGAL COSTS  AND FOR FOREIGN EDUCATORS NOT TO BE CHARGED MORE THAN A NOMINAL APPLICATION PROCESSING FEE  UNDER   IT HAS NOT BEEN WIDELY ADOPTED  AND MS  AVENIDA SAID SHE DISAGREED WITH THE GROUPS CONCLUSIONS SOMEBODY HAS TO FOOT THE BILL  SHE SAID  AND IN A CLIMATE OF TIGHT SCHOOL BUDGETS  THAT SOMEBODY IS THE TEACHER READ  HOW WILL THE PROTESTS AGAINST EDUCATION CUTS AFFECT THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS LESSONS AND CHALLENGESIN MR  SOBERANOS CASE  IT WAS NOT UNTIL HIS SECOND YEAR ON THE JOB THAT HE HAD PAID BACK THE MONEY HE OWED AND WAS ABLE TO BEGIN SENDING SOME HOME TO HIS FAMILY  HE HAS HAD TO LIVE AUSTERELY  IN HIS FIRST YEAR IN ARIZONA  HE SHARED AN APARTMENT WITH FIVE OTHER FILIPINO TEACHERS  AND HE NOW RENTS A ROOM IN THE HOME OF A FILIPINO AMERICAN FAMILY STILL  HE SAID HE WAS NOTHING BUT GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY  THE DISTRICT IS VERY SUPPORTIVE  HE SAID  PENDERGAST CREATED A WELCOME COMMITTEE TO ASSIST THE FILIPINO TEACHERS  AND COLLEAGUES PITCHED IN BY BUYING GROCERIES AND DRIVING THE NEWCOMERS TO WORK IN ADDITION TO FINANCIAL CHALLENGES  FOREIGN EDUCATORS FACE INSTRUCTIONAL ONES  ADMINISTRATORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO WORK WITH J 1 VISA HOLDERS SAY THE TEACHERS MUST LEARN THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENT FOR INCLUSION  WHICH REQUIRES THAT DISABLED CHILDREN BE TAUGHT ALONGSIDE NONDISABLED PEERS  IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT POSSIBLE AND CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES DIFFER ACROSS CULTURES  IN THE PHILIPPINES  THE TEACHER THERE IS REALLY AN AUTHORITY FIGURE  MR  SOBERANO SAID  ONCE I STOOD IN FRONT OF THE CLASS  EVERYBODY KEPT QUIET  THAT WASNT THE CASE IN ARIZONA ONE THING I ALSO LEARNED IS TO BE FRIENDS WITH THE STUDENTS  MR  SOBERANO ADDED  TO KNOW MORE ABOUT EACH ONE AND ESPECIALLY THEIR FAMILY  HOW ARE THEY DOING  WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THEM  I REMOVE THAT KIND OF PROBLEM STATE DEPARTMENT REGULATIONS REQUIRE J 1 TEACHERS TO ENGAGE IN CULTURAL EXCHANGE ACTIVITIES WITH THEIR STUDENTS  THE J 1 PROGRAM WAS CREATED BY THE 1961 FULBRIGHT HAYES ACT  WITH THE PURPOSE OF FOSTERING UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN NATIONS  MR  SOBERANO SAID THAT ONCE A MONTH  HE TEACHES A LESSON ON FILIPINO CULTURE  AND THAT HIS STUDENTS HAVE BEEN MOST INTERESTED IN DISCUSSING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FILIPINO AND AMERICAN EDUCATION SYSTEMS  IN THE PHILIPPINES  MR  SOBERANO TELLS THEM  SCHOOL IS STRICTER AND MORE ACADEMICALLY CHALLENGING NEW REGULATIONS FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT  WHICH WENT INTO EFFECT IN 2016  REQUIRE J 1 HOLDERS TO RETURN TO THEIR HOME COUNTRIES FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS AFTER THEIR VISAS EXPIRE BEFORE REAPPLYING  MR  SOBERANO SAID HE MAY DO THAT  BUT HIS WISH IS TO RESIDE LEGALLY IN THE UNITED STATES AND WORK LONG TERM AS A TEACHER  I WOULD LOVE TO BRING MY FAMILY HERE  HE SAID MS  WEINGARTEN  THE UNION PRESIDENT  SUGGESTED THAT THE H 1B VISA FOR HIGH SKILLED IMMIGRANTS  WHICH OFFERS A PATHWAY TOWARD PERMANENT RESIDENCE  WOULD BE A MORE APPROPRIATE VISA FOR A TEACHER LIKE MR  SOBERANO  BUT PENDERGAST AND OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS SAY LONG WAIT TIMES AND HIGH LEGAL COSTS CAN MAKE THE H 1B PROHIBITIVE  THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO TIGHTENED OVERSIGHT OF THAT PROGRAM IN DENVER PUBLIC SCHOOLS  20 BILINGUAL EDUCATION TEACHERS HOLD H 1BS AND ABOUT THREE HOLD J 1S  BUT IN THE FUTURE  THE DISTRICT SAID  IT MAY EXPAND ITS USE OF THE J 1 WE STILL DONT HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO FILL THE OPENINGS  SAID BART MULLER  THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF EMPLOYEE AND LABOR RELATIONS FOR THE SYSTEM  THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN A LITTLE CHALLENGING OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF  THE BOTTOM LINE IS THERE ARE A LOT MORE HOOPS TO JUMP THROUGH WITH H 1B  WHILE J 1 IS FAIRLY SIMPLE  YOU CAN DO IT EXPEDITIOUSLY LORA BARTLETT  AN EDUCATION PROFESSOR WHO HAS WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT MIGRANT TEACHERS  ARGUED THAT THERE SHOULD BE A NEW VISA CATEGORY THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHILE ALLOWING EFFECTIVE TEACHERS TO ACHIEVE LEGAL RESIDENCY  BUT  SHE ADDED  THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN NOT FINDING A LONG TERM SOLUTION  THERE IS A WHOLE INDUSTRY THAT MAKES MONEY EVERY TIME A NEW TEACHER COMES INTO THE COUNTRY  THEY DONT MAKE MONEY WHEN A TEACHER STAYS READ   HOW OUR REPORTER CAME ACROSS THIS STORY AND IN ARIZONA  WHERE MANY TEACHERS ARE EXPECTED TO IMPROVE TEST SCORES USING AGING TEXTBOOKS INSIDE BUILDINGS IN NEED OF REPAIR  DISTRICTS WORRY THAT A MODEST INCREASE IN TEACHER SALARIES AND SCHOOL FUNDING WONT BE ENOUGH TO PERSUADE MORE LOCAL CANDIDATES TO ENTER THE PROFESSION QUITE FRANKLY  FOR A LOT OF THE TEACHERS  SOME OF THE FUN AND CREATIVITY HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT OF IT WITH MANDATES  SAID MS  AMERSON  THE HEAD OF HUMAN RESOURCES IN CASA GRANDE  IT SEEMS LIKE WE SPEND THE WHOLE ENTIRE SECOND SEMESTER TESTING KIDS IN PENDERGAST  MS  DAVIS TUSSEY AGREED THAT HIGHER PAY ALONE WOULD NOT BE

20180503,business,money,4,WASHINGTON  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS ISSUED DIRECTIVES TO ADDRESS SEXUAL HARASSMENT  BUT CRITICS SAY THE NEW RULES COULD BE UNEVENLY APPLIED ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT  LEAVING SOME EMPLOYEES UNPROTECTED THE NEW POLICIES  SENT TO DIVISION HEADS ON WEDNESDAY  WERE DRAFTED IN RESPONSE TO A 48 PAGE REPORT ISSUED LAST YEAR BY MICHAEL E  HOROWITZ  THE DEPARTMENTS INSPECTOR GENERAL  THAT DESCRIBED HARASSMENT  ASSAULT AND SEXUAL MISCONDUCT THE DEPARTMENT WILL NOT WAIT FOR A PATTERN OF OFFENSIVE CONDUCT TO EMERGE BEFORE ADDRESSING CLAIMS OF HARASSMENT  ACCORDING TO THREE MEMOS  OBTAINED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT OUTLINE THE GUIDELINES  RATHER  THE DEPARTMENT WILL ACT BEFORE THE HARASSING CONDUCT IS SO PERVASIVE AND OFFENSIVE AS TO CONSTITUTE A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT READ THE MEMOS HERE THE DIRECTIVES  WRITTEN BY THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL  ROD J  ROSENSTEIN  AND TWO OTHER OFFICIALS IN HIS OFFICE  ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE DEPARTMENT METES OUT SERIOUS AND CONSISTENT PUNISHMENTS TO THOSE FOUND GUILTY OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT  AND THAT EACH SECTION IN THE DEPARTMENT IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR HOW IT HANDLES ACCUSATIONS OF HARASSMENT AND MISCONDUCT INDIVIDUAL UNITS MUST PUNISH PEOPLE FOUND GUILTY OF HARASSMENT IN A CONSISTENT MANNER AND TAKE MEASURES TO PROTECT ACCUSERS AS CASES ARE BEING INVESTIGATED THE POLICIES DIRECT SECTIONS TO SYSTEMATICALLY TRACK SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS  EACH ALLEGATION MUST SPECIFY THE NATURE OF THE CLAIM  WHETHER IT WAS REPORTED TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OR TO SECURITY  AND THE DISCIPLINARY ACTION TAKEN  AND THEY SAY THAT MANAGERS MUST ACCOUNT FOR SUCH ALLEGATIONS BEFORE GIVING AN EMPLOYEE AN AWARD OR OTHER PUBLIC COMMENDATION BUT THE GUIDELINES ALLOW EACH UNIT TO DECIDE HOW BEST TO ENFORCE MANY OF THE NEW DIRECTIVES  A DECISION THAT CRITICS SAY DOES NOT COMPLY WITH ONE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERALS TOP RECOMMENDATIONS OF EQUAL POLICY ENFORCEMENT ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT THE DEPARTMENTS SPRAWLING NETWORK OF PROSECUTORIAL OFFICES AND OTHER OUTPOSTS EMPLOY MORE THAN 115 000 STAFF MEMBERS  THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS ALSO HAVE DIFFERENT REPUTATIONS CONCERNING HOW THEY TREAT EMPLOYEES THERE SHOULD NOT BE DISCRETION AMONG COMPONENTS IN HOW EACH APPLIES A DIRECTIVE  SAID CATHY HARRIS  AN EMPLOYMENT LAWYER AT KATOR  PARKS  WEISER   HARRIS  YOU COULD HAVE ONE COMPONENT SAY IT WILL WAIT 30 DAYS AFTER A COMPLAINT BEFORE INVESTIGATING IT  WHEREAS ANOTHER COULD LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION WITHIN A BUSINESS DAY  WHAT WE NEED HERE IS TOP DOWN LEADERSHIP OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS  THE INSPECTOR GENERAL HAS ISSUED AT LEAST FOUR REPORTS DETAILING EPISODES OF HARASSMENT  ASSAULT AND SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AT THE DEPARTMENT  INCLUDING THE SOLICITATION OF PROSTITUTES AND EMPLOYEES ASKING COLLEAGUES TO WATCH PORNOGRAPHY IN THE MOST RECENT REPORT  ISSUED IN MAY  MR  HOROWITZ DESCRIBED INSTRUCTORS WHO HAD SLEPT WITH TRAINEES AND AN EMPLOYEE WHO HAD STALKED A COLLEAGUE  MANAGERS WERE INCONSISTENT IN HOW THEY PUNISHED WRONGDOERS  HE SAID  AND IN WHETHER THEY ENFORCED THOSE PENALTIES THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL AND HIS OFFICE HAVE BEEN SLOW TO RESPOND  MR  HOROWITZ GAVE THE DEPARTMENT 60 DAYS AFTER THAT REPORT WAS RELEASED TO INDICATE HOW IT WOULD ADDRESS HIS CONCERNS  MR  ROSENSTEIN ISSUED THE POLICIES EIGHT MONTHS AFTER THAT DEADLINE SOON AFTER THE MAY REPORT  A GROUP OF JUSTICE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES ASKED TO MEET WITH THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE  ACCORDING TO EMPLOYEES BRIEFED ON THOSE REQUESTS  IN A LETTER WRITTEN IN AUGUST  THEY SOUGHT TO BE PART OF ANY NEXT STEPS  OFFICIALS RESPONDED TO THAT LETTER IN DECEMBER OVER THE PAST YEAR  TWO WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD TO PUBLICLY ACCUSE COLLEAGUES OF RETALIATION AFTER THEY REPORTED SEXUAL HARASSMENT  A TIMES INVESTIGATION IN MARCH FOUND THAT OFFICIALS HAD IGNORED YEARS OF COMPLAINTS THAT SUPERVISORS IN THE DEATH PENALTY UNIT HAD ENGAGED IN GENDER DISCRIMINATION AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT  THE DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATED SOME OF THE ALLEGATIONS  ONE OF WHICH WAS SUPPORTED BY TEXTS AND FIRSTHAND ACCOUNTS  BUT THE MEN ARE STILL DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES THREE DAYS AFTER THE TIMES PUBLISHED ITS ARTICLE  MR  HOROWITZ MET WITH JUSTICE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES TO TALK ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT  HUNDREDS PACKED THE DEPARTMENTS GREAT HALL  FILLING SEATS AND LINING THE PERIMETER OF THE ROOM THE MODERATOR FOR THE EVENT TOLD FELLOW EMPLOYEES THAT DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS HAD RESPONDED TO THE INSPECTOR GENERALS REPORT LAST YEAR BY SAYING THAT THE EPISODES HE UNCOVERED HAD ALL OCCURRED UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION  MR  HOROWITZ SAID THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT WAS A SYSTEMIC ISSUE AND THAT HE HOPED IT WOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY NO MATTER WHOS IN CHARGE EMPLOYEES TOLD MR  HOROWITZ THAT THEY WERE FRUSTRATED THAT PEOPLE WERE RARELY FIRED AFTER BEING FOUND GUILTY OF HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT  HE REPLIED THAT PEOPLE IN THE DEPARTMENT WERE TAKING FAR MORE SERIOUSLY ISSUES THAT IN THE PAST HAD NOT  AND THAT HIS OFFICE HAD SEEN CASES THAT RESULTED IN TERMINATIONS THAT WERE NOT SURE IN THE PAST WOULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED AS TERMINATIONS MR  HOROWITZ SAID THAT THE DEPARTMENT WAS LIKELY TO ENFORCE MORE SEVERE PUNISHMENTS AS IT TOOK HARASSMENT MORE SERIOUSLY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS NEW POLICIES MAKE EXPLICIT THAT SUBSTANTIATED SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASES SHOULD RESULT IN A PENALTY RANGING FROM A 15 DAY SUSPENSION TO REMOVAL BUT MR  HOROWITZ WARNED AT THE MEETING THAT THE DEPARTMENT COULD FACE OTHER CHALLENGES AS IT BECAME MORE WILING TO ISSUE HARSHER PENALTIES  INDIVIDUALS FOUND GUILTY OF WRONGDOING OFTEN CHALLENGE SOME OF THE HARSHER  YOU KNOW STRONGER PENALTIES  HE SAID THAT IN THE PAST  THEIR PUNISHMENTS HAVE BEEN SOFTENED AFTER THEY PUSHED BACK IF YOU HAVE ZERO TOLERANCE  HOW CAN YOU PERMIT PEOPLE FOUND TO HAVE COMMITTED MORE EGREGIOUS ACTS OF HARASSMENT OR ASSAULT TO CONTINUE TO WORK AND WALK THE HALLS  SAID MS  HARRIS  THE LAWYER  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS A VERY PRESTIGIOUS PLACE TO WORK  THEY CAN ENFORCE TRUE ZERO TOLERANCE AND FIRE PEOPLE  WHICH IS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CORPORATE AMERICA RIGHT NOW AT THE DEATH PENALTY UNIT  THE DEPUTY SUPERVISOR THERE WAS ACCUSED OF GROPING HIS ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT AT A RESTAURANT  TRYING TO PERSUADE HER TO CHECK INTO A HOTEL AND SENDING HER TEXTS OFFERING TO GIVE HER MONEY OR TAKE HER ON A TRIP  COLLEAGUES WHO HAD WITNESSED THE EPISODE AT THE RESTAURANT AND READ THE TEXTS TOLD MANAGERS AND THE INSPECTOR GENERAL  THAT SUPERVISOR STILL WORKS AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND IS APPEALING THE DEPARTMENTS DECISION TO MOVE HIM TO A DIFFERENT UNIT THE QUESTION THIS RAISES IS WHO DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE PRIORITIZE  MS  HARRIS SAID  RIGHT NOW  THEYRE WORRIED ABOUT BEING SUED BY HARASSERS  THEY SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT BEING SUED BY THE VICTIMS WHOSE CLAIMS ARE IGNORED  THAT WILL BE MUCH MORE DAMAGING

WORLD CASH BURNTESLA IS NOT TURNING A PROFIT  WHICH MEANS IT HAS TO USE CASH TO PAY THE BILLS  THE BIG QUESTION FROM INVESTORS  DOES TESLA HAVE ENOUGH TESLA WENT THROUGH NEARLY  MILLION DURING THE

PROJECTS  FOR A TOTAL OF SLIGHTLY MORE THAN  BILLION ANALYSTS CALL THIS SITUATION  NEGATIVE FREE CASH FLOW  AND IT HELPED CUT TESLA S CASH BALANCE TO  7 BILLION AT THE END OF MARCH  IF THE COMPANY KEEPS BURNING THROUGH ITS CASH AT THE SAME PACE  IT COULD RUN OUT WITHIN A YEAR AND BE FORCED TO SELL MORE OF ITS STOCK OR BORROW MONEY TESLA SAYS IT WON T COME TO THAT  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO TAKE IN MORE CASH THAN IT SPENDS IN THE SECOND HALF OF THIS YEAR  SOME OF THAT WILL LIKELY BE DUE TO PLANNED SPENDING CUTS ON MACHINERY  EQUIPMENT AND OTHER CAPITAL EXPENSES DEBTREINING IN SPENDING WILL HELP  BUT TESLA STILL FACES HEFTY DEBT PAYMENTS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS THE COMPANY HAS TO PAY BACK  3 BILLION IN DEBT THAT COMES DUE LATER THIS YEAR AND IN EARLY 2019  AND TO DO SO  WHILE COVERING ITS

AT A RATE OF MORE THAN 2 000 A WEEK TO GET THERE  TESLA WILL NEED TO SMOOTH OUT PROBLEMS IT S ENCOUNTERED AS IT TRIES TO MAKE THE PRODUCTION MORE AUTOMATED  A PROCESS THAT IT CALLS THE  MACHINE THAT BUILDS THE MACHINE TESLA ACKNOWLEDGED ON WEDNESDAY THAT IT WAS OVERLY AMBITIOUS IN ITS EFFORTS AND THAT IT  MADE A MISTAKE BY ADDING TOO MUCH AUTOMATION TOO QUICKLY  ONE EXAMPLE MUSK GAVE WAS OF A MACHINE THAT PLACED FIBERGLASS MATS ON TOP OF BATTERY PACKS  THE COMPANY FOUND THAT HUMAN HANDS ARE BETTER THAN MACHINES AT PICKING UP THESE PIECES OF FIBERGLASS  WHICH MUSK SAID LOOK LIKE  FLUFF IN

INVESTOR CONFIDENCEA BIG PART OF TESLA S SHARE PRICE IS INVESTORS  FAITH IN MUSK THEY VE POURED DOLLARS INTO TESLA STOCK ON THE BELIEF THAT THE CEO  WHO PREVIOUSLY HELPED NURTURE PAYPAL AND WHOSE OTHER COMPANY  SPACEX  LAUNCHES ROCKETS AND SPACECRAFT  CAN REVOLUTIONIZE THE AUTO INDUSTRY BUT SOME OF THAT INVESTOR CONFIDENCE MAY HAVE BEEN SHAKEN FOLLOWING MUSK S BEHAVIOR ON A CONFERENCE CALL

IN A SPORT FOR AT LEAST THREE SEASONS A YEAR AT THE EXCLUSION OF OTHER SPORTS TOO OFTEN  DR  POPKIN AND HIS ASSOCIATES AT COLUMBIA AND MEDICAL CENTERS ELSEWHERE FIND THEMSELVES TREATING THE FALLOUT FROM EARLY SPORTS SPECIALIZATION WHEN THE PARTICIPANTS DEVELOP OVERUSE INJURIES DR  MININDER S  KOCHER  PEDIATRIC ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON AT CHILDRENS HOSPITAL BOSTON AND ANOTHER OF THE CONFERENCES SPEAKERS  TOLD ME  IVE BEEN DOING TOMMY JOHN SURGERY  AN ELBOW RECONSTRUCTION PROCEDURE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL PLAYERS  ON MORE AND MORE KIDS WHO DAMAGED THEIR ARMS BY PITCHING FOR TOO MANY HOURS IN TOO MANY GAMES AND PRACTICES IN A PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF NEARLY 12 000 YOUNGSTERS WITH HIGHLY ACCURATE HISTORIES OF SPORTS RELATED INJURIES  DR  KOCHER AND COLLEAGUES FOUND THAT EARLY SPECIALIZATION IN BASEBALL  CHEERLEADING AND GYMNASTICS INCREASED THE RISK OF INJURY AMONG BOYS  AND SPECIALIZATION IN RUNNING  SWIMMING  SOCCER AND VOLLEYBALL  AS WELL AS CHEERLEADING AND GYMNASTICS  INCREASED THE INJURY RISK AMONG GIRLS THE INJURIES  REPORTED BY THEIR MOTHERS  ALL OF WHOM ARE REGISTERED NURSES  INCLUDED STRESS FRACTURES  TENDINITIS AND KNEE INJURIES LIKE TEARS OF THE ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT  OR A C L  THAT REQUIRE SURGICAL REPAIR INTENSE AND REPETITIVE TRAINING CAN LEAD TO PEDIATRIC TRAUMA AND MAY REQUIRE SURGERY TO YOUNG SHOULDERS  KNEES  ELBOWS AND WRISTS  THE ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS ORGANIZATION REPORTED  IT NOTED THAT IN CHILDREN WHOSE BODIES ARE STILL GROWING AND DEVELOPING  EXCESSIVE TRAINING IN A SINGLE SPORT DOES NOT GIVE THEM ENOUGH TIME TO HEAL PROPERLY DR  KOCHER SAID IN AN INTERVIEW THAT CHILDREN WHO GROW UP IN THE NORTHERN UNITED STATES ARE MORE LIKELY TO BECOME MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYERS THAN KIDS FROM THE SOUTH BECAUSE THEY CANT PLAY THEIR SPORT YEAR ROUND AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE INJURED BUT EVEN WHEN NOT INJURED  YOUNGSTERS PRESSURED TO BECOME STAR ATHLETES OFTEN BURN OUT AND DROP OUT  SOMETIMES FROM SPORTS ALTOGETHER  DR  KOCHER SAID CHILDREN WHO SPECIALIZE IN ONE SPORT EARLY IN LIFE WERE FOUND TO BE THE FIRST TO QUIT THEIR SPORT AND ENDED UP HAVING HIGHER INACTIVITY RATES AS AN ADULT  DR  POPKIN REPORTED  BASED ON FINDINGS OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL SOCIETY FOR SPORTS MEDICINE HE EMPHASIZED THAT PARENTAL INFLUENCE ON SPORTS SPECIALIZATION CAN BE PROFOUND AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE IF IT DOESNT MESH WITH THE CHILDS GOALS AND INTERESTS  IF CHILDREN ARE TO BE SUCCESSFUL AT A SPORT  THE DRIVE TO SPECIALIZE AND SUCCEED MUST BE INTRINSIC  OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING IF THEY LACK AN INTRINSIC DRIVE  IF THEYRE NOT HAVING FUN  THEYLL LIKELY BECOME FRUSTRATED AND QUIT  HE SAID  WHEN PARENTS HIRE PERSONAL TRAINERS AND COACHES  THERES AN EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS THAT CAN CREATE A PRESSURE COOKER SCENARIO AND LEAD TO BURNOUT  IN A SURVEY OF 201 PARENTS OF YOUNG ATHLETES  57 PERCENT HOPED THEIR CHILDREN WOULD PLAY IN COLLEGE OR PROFESSIONALLY  DR  POPKIN REPORTED IN HIS STUDY OF 303 COLLEGE ATHLETES  98 PERCENT CURRENTLY PLAYING ONE SPORT HAD PREVIOUSLY PLAYED ANOTHER ORGANIZED SPORT BEFORE COLLEGE  THEY DIDNT BEGIN TO SPECIALIZE UNTIL THEY WERE NEARLY 15  ON AVERAGE  HE NOTED THAT MARIANO RIVERA  CONSIDERED THE BEST CLOSING PITCHER IN BASEBALL HISTORY  HAD PLAYED SOCCER  HIS FAVORITE SPORT AS A YOUTH  BEFORE FOCUSING ON BASEBALL IN HIS LATE TEENS YOU WANT KIDS PLAYING SPORTS THROUGH LIFE  DR  POPKIN SAID  THERE ARE LOTS OF BENEFITS TO LATER SPORTS SPECIALIZATION  AT SOME POINT IN HIGH SCHOOL  THE MORE SPORTS KIDS PLAY  THE BETTER THEY LEARN ADAPTABILITY  THEY LEARN HOW TO LEARN ITS ALSO IMPORTANT  HE SAID  FOR KIDS TO CROSS TRAIN BY DOING MULTIPLE SPORTS SO THAT THEY DEVELOP WHOLE BODY SKILLS LIKE BALANCE  QUICKNESS AND CORE STRENGTH THAT CAN ENHANCE THEIR OVERALL ATHLETIC ABILITY DR  POPKIN SAID THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW INDIVIDUAL SPORTS LIKE GYMNASTICS  TENNIS AND FENCING  KIDS DO BETTER IF THEY SPECIALIZE LATER  IN HIS STUDY OF COLLEGE ATHLETES  ONLY 18 PERCENT REPORTED SPECIALIZING BY AGE 12  FORTY FIVE PERCENT PLAYED MULTIPLE SPORTS UP TO AGE 16  AND THERE WERE NO EARLY SPECIALIZERS AMONG THOSE WHO PLAYED FOOTBALL  LACROSSE OR FIELD HOCKEY ITS A MYTH  DR  POPKIN SAID  THAT ATHLETES WHO GOT COLLEGE ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIPS OR BECAME PROFESSIONALS IN MOST SPORTS BEGAN SPECIALIZING AT EARLY AGES  EARLY SPORTS SPECIALIZATION IS UNCOMMON AMONG N C A A  DIVISION 1 ATHLETES FOR MOST TEAM SPORTS  HE REPORTED HIS SUGGESTIONS TO PARENTS  EXPOSE YOUR CHILDREN TO AS MANY ACTIVITIES AS POSSIBLE AND SUPPORT WHAT THEY LIKE  BUT IF THEYRE DOING MORE HOURS OF A SPORT A WEEK THAN THEIR AGE IN YEARS  THEYRE OVERDOING IT A COUPLE OF MONTHS OF THE YEAR  ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO SOMETHING ELSE  IF THEY PLAY SOCCER  THEY COULD SWITCH OFF TO TENNIS  IF THEY PLAY HOCKEY  THEY COULD TRY THE TRACK TEAM  CROSS TRAINING HELPS THEIR BODIES AND CAN KEEP THEM FROM BURNING OUT

MINISTER  HAUNTED BY SCANDAL  THE LIKUD LEADER IS A CONTROVERSIAL FIGURE AT HOME AND ABROAD  HE MAKES HEADLINES AND AROUSES STRONG FEELINGS BECAUSE HE DEALS WITH BIG AND ENORMOUSLY DIVISIVE ISSUES  WAR AND PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST  THE NUCLEAR AMBITIONS OF IRAN  THE FUTURE OF THE PALESTINIANS AND THE FATE OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE  NOT NECESSARILY IN THAT ORDER  HE HAS A STRONG SENSE OF HISTORY AND ESPECIALLY OF HIS OWN INDISPENSABLE ROLE IN MAKING IT ANSHEL PFEFFERS BIOGRAPHY IS SUPERBLY TIMED  APPEARING AS ISRAELI JUSTICE CLOSES IN ON A MAN WHO HAS BEEN IN POWER FOR NEARLY A DECADE AND IS A MAJOR PLAYER IN WHAT HE FAMOUSLY CALLS A TOUGH NEIGHBORHOOD FOR FAR LONGER  BIBI  AS HE IS KNOWN AT HOME  THOUGH THE USE OF HIS CHILDHOOD NICKNAME DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY IMPLY AFFECTION  COMES ACROSS AS A MORE COMPLEX FIGURE THAN HIS LEGENDARY MASTERY OF THE SOUND BITE SUGGESTS  FAMILY BACKGROUND AND TRIBAL POLITICS ARE TWO OF THE MAIN STRANDS OF HIS STORY  AMERICA  WHERE HE SPENT MUCH OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND FORMATIVE STAGES OF HIS CAREER  IS ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT ONE IF THERE IS A MASTER KEY TO CRACKING THE BIBI CODE  THIS INSIGHTFUL AND READABLE BOOK ARGUES  IT IS HIS IDENTITY AS SOMEONE WHO HAS ALWAYS STOOD OUTSIDE THE MAINSTREAM  THIS DISTANCE IS SOMETHING OF A FAMILY INHERITANCE  NETANYAHUS GRANDFATHER AND FATHER WERE MEMBERS OF THE RIGHT WING REVISIONIST MOVEMENT AT A TIME WHEN ZIONISM WAS DOMINATED BY THE LEFT IN EASTERN EUROPE  AMERICA AND PALESTINE  THERE IS A FAMILIAR THEME IN ISRAELS HISTORY  MOST ELOQUENTLY EVOKED BY THE LATE ISRAELI WRITER AMOS ELON  THAT THE STATES FOUNDING FATHERS AND THEIR SONS BEHAVED VERY DIFFERENTLY  IN THE CASE OF THE NETANYAHUS  THE INABILITY TO BECOME PART OF THE ESTABLISHMENT  AS PFEFFER PUTS IT  MADE FOR UNUSUAL CONTINUITY BETWEEN THE GENERATIONS NETANYAHU WAS BORN IN TEL AVIV IN 1949  A YEAR AFTER ISRAELS INDEPENDENCE AND WHAT PALESTINIANS CALL THE NAKBA  CATASTROPHE  FORGED ONE OF THE WORLDS MOST INTRACTABLE CONFLICTS  HIS EXPERIENCE ATTENDING HIGH SCHOOL IN PHILADELPHIA  WHERE HIS FATHER HAD TAKEN AN ACADEMIC JOB  INSTILLED IN HIM VIEWS THAT WERE OUT OF SYNC WITH THEN LITTLE ISRAELS COLLECTIVIST ETHOS  HE HAS OFTEN BEEN ACCUSED BY HIS CRITICS OVER THE YEARS OF BEING MORE AMERICAN THAN ISRAELI  HIS ELDER BROTHER YONI  AN OFFICER IN THE ISRAELI ARMYS ELITE SAYERET MATKAL UNIT  WAS A POWERFUL INFLUENCE  ONE MAGNIFIED BY GRIEF WHEN YONI WAS KILLED IN THE ENTEBBE HOSTAGE RESCUE MISSION IN 1976  BIBI SERVED IN THE SAME UNIT  HIS ROLE COMMEMORATING THE FALLEN HERO PROVIDED HIS FIRST INTENSE EXPOSURE TO PUBLIC LIFE BY THE EARLY 1980S  AFTER STUDYING AT M I T  AND WORKING AS A MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT  NETANYAHU WAS A RISING STAR AT ISRAELS WASHINGTON EMBASSY  IT WAS THERE  AND LATER AS AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS  THAT HE HONED HIS FORMIDABLE PUBLIC RELATIONS SKILLS  KNOWN AS HASBARA IN HEBREW  BEFRIENDING COLUMNISTS  TALK SHOW HOSTS AND INFLUENTIAL AND WEALTHY JEWISH AND OTHER AMERICANS  INCLUDING THE REAL ESTATE ENTREPRENEUR DONALD TRUMP  IN 1988  AS THE FIRST PALESTINIAN INTIFADA WAS CHALLENGING THE STATUS QUO OF THE POST 1967 OCCUPATION  HE WENT HOME TO JOIN THE LIKUD PARTY  THE WORLD BEYOND THE BELTWAY FIRST NOTICED HIM ON CNN  DONNING A GAS MASK ON AIR DURING THE 1991 GULF WAR IMAGEPFEFFER IS ONE OF THE SMARTEST AND MOST PROLIFIC OF ISRAELS YOUNGER GENERATION OF JOURNALISTS  HIS WORK FOR HAARETZ REFLECTS THAT PAPERS LIBERAL BENT  INSTINCTIVELY OPPOSED TO NETANYAHU AND MUCH OF WHAT HE REPRESENTS  IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE THAT THIS AUTHOR EVER VOTED FOR HIS SUBJECT  BIBI  OBSESSED BY HOSTILE LEFT WING MEDIA  COMPLAINED PRE EMPTIVELY THAT THIS BIOGRAPHY WOULD BE A CARTOON  IT IS NOT  IT FLESHES OUT A SUPERFICIALLY FAMILIAR AND INVARIABLY QUOTABLE FIGURE WITH A WEALTH OF BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND ANALYSIS THAT PROVIDE NECESSARY AND  OF COURSE  OFTEN HIGHLY CRITICAL CONTEXT YET IT IS ALSO FAIR  IN 1995  BEFORE THE TRAUMA OF YITZHAK RABINS ASSASSINATION BY A JEWISH EXTREMIST  NETANYAHU WAS WIDELY ACCUSED OF INCITEMENT  NOT FAIR  PFEFFER CONCLUDES  EXPLAINING THAT NETANYAHU NEVERTHELESS CHOSE TO RIDE THE FAR RIGHT TIGER  YASIR ARAFAT PAID RABINS WIDOW A CONDOLENCE CALL  BIBI WAS NOT WELCOME BUT HE STILL WON AN ELECTION  ALBEIT BY A TINY MARGIN  SOON AFTERWARD  ANOTHER INTERESTING OBSERVATION ON PFEFFERS PART IS THAT NETANYAHU IS NO FAN OF MILITARY ACTION  TENDING TO CAUTION AND EVEN INDECISION  REJECTING  FOR EXAMPLE  A GROUND OFFENSIVE AFTER THE ISRAELI AIR CAMPAIGN IN THE GAZA WAR OF 2014 PFEFFER RIGHTLY FOCUSES ON BIBIS ATTITUDE TOWARD THE PALESTINIANS  IN HIS FIRST TERM OF OFFICE IN 1996  HE INHERITED RABINS LANDMARK OSLO AGREEMENT WITH THE P L O  WHICH THE LIKUD OPPOSED  BUT STILL GRUDGINGLY COMPLIED WITH IT  BACK IN POWER IN 2009 AFTER A PERIOD THAT ENCOMPASSED THE SECOND INTIFADA  ARAFATS DEATH AND ARIEL SHARONS UNILATERAL WITHDRAWAL FROM GAZA  HE CAME TO APPRECIATE HOW OSLO MAINTAINED ISRAELS SECURITY WHILE ALLOWING SETTLEMENTS TO EXPAND AS THE AMERICAN LED PEACE PROCESS WENT NOWHERE SLOWLY  NETANYAHU WAS INITIALLY SEEN AS COMMITTED TO A TWO STATE SOLUTION WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY DEMANDING THAT PALESTINIANS RECOGNIZE ISRAEL AS THE NATION STATE OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE  BUT A FEW YEARS LATER THE MOST HE WAS PREPARED TO CONTEMPLATE WAS A STATE MINUS  RIVALS FURTHER TO THE RIGHT DO NOT EVEN GO THAT FAR  THE ONLY PEACE HE HAS BEEN WILLING TO CONSIDER  PFEFFER CONCLUDES  IS ONE WHERE ISRAEL BULLIES THE PALESTINIANS INTO SUBMISSION  UNTIL THAT HAPPENS  HE WILL CONTINUE BUILDING WALLS NETANYAHU  IN THIS VIEW  HAS ALWAYS SEEN THE PALESTINIAN ISSUE AS A DIVERSION  A RABBIT HOLE THAT MISINFORMED WESTERNERS INSIST ON GOING DOWN  TERRORISM AND UNCHANGING ARAB AND MUSLIM HOSTILITY WERE AND REMAIN HIS PREFERRED EMPHASES  IN RECENT YEARS HIS PRIMARY OBSESSION HAS BEEN THE DANGER FROM IRAN  WHOSE PLANS TO ACQUIRE NUCLEAR WEAPONS  AND BREAK ISRAELS REGIONAL MONOPOLY ON THEM  HE SAYS THREATEN A NEW HOLOCAUST  BARACK OBAMAS SUPPORT FOR THE 2015 IRANIAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT AND HIS EFFORTS TO CURB ISRAELI SETTLEMENTS MEANT THAT MUTUAL LOATHING BETWEEN PRESIDENT AND PRIME MINISTER WAS INEVITABLE  TRUMP IS A DIFFERENT AND OF COURSE UNFINISHED STORY   BIBIS AIDES  PERHAPS UNSURPRISINGLY  HAVE BEGUN BRANDING UNFAVORABLE MEDIA REPORTS AS FAKE NEWS BIBIS STANDING HAS BEEN TARNISHED BY INVESTIGATIONS INTO BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION  ACCUSED OF ACCEPTING GIFTS OF CASH  CHAMPAGNE AND CIGARS  AND BY THE ANTICS OF HIS WIFE  SARA  WHOSE TANTRUMS AND LAVISH SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT AT PUBLIC EXPENSE MADE FOR DAMAGING LEAKS  ACQUIRING THE LOYALTY OF HIS OWN UNCRITICAL RIGHT WING MEDIA OUTLET WAS ONE RESPONSE  SOWING FEAR AND PROMOTING DIVISION WERE OTHERS  FOR HIS FOURTH ELECTION VICTORY IN 2015 THE BIBI CAMPAIGN BOMBARDED DISENCHANTED LIKUD SUPPORTERS WITH MESSAGES ABOUT THE DANGERS OF A PALESTINIAN STATE AND RACIST WARNINGS ABOUT ARAB CITIZENS VOTING IN DROVES  THE RESULT IS AN EROSION OF ISRAELS DEMOCRACY STILL  NETANYAHU WINS STANDING OVATIONS FROM SUPPORTERS  IN PARTICULAR IN THE UNITED STATES  FOR BETTER OR WORSE HE EMBODIES ISRAEL AS A MODERN  HYBRID SOCIETY OF ANCIENT PHOBIAS AND HIGH TECH HOPE  A COMBINATION OF TRIBALISM AND GLOBALISM  NETANYAHU SEES HIMSELF  PFEFFER POINTS OUT  NOT JUST AS ISRAELS PREMIER BUT AS THE LEADER OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE AND HE SEEMS LITTLE CONCERNED WITH THE PROBLEM THAT BEDEVILS ZIONISM 70 YEARS AFTER THE BIRTH OF THE JEWISH STATE  WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO INHABIT THAT BITTERLY CONTESTED LAND  IN FACT  THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT OF BIBIS CAREER CAN BE SEEN AS A NEGATIVE ONE  AS PFEFFER DESCRIBES IT  TRYING TO ENSURE THAT ISRAEL DID NOT HAVE CLEARLY DEFINED OR INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED BORDERS THIS BOOK IS A NECESSARY CONTRIBUTION TO UNDERSTANDING A HIGH PROFILE AND INTERNATIONALLY CONTENTIOUS FIGURE AND THE FRACTURED COUNTRY HE HAS LED FOR SO LONG  IT IS  INEVITABLY  ALREADY OUT OF DATE  BUT BIBIS TURBULENT TIMES ARE NOT OVER YET

TEAM  EMMET T  FLOOD  A LAWYER HIRED BY MR  TRUMP ON WEDNESDAY  WAS NOT INVOLVED IN MR  GIULIANIS PLANS TO REVEAL THE PAYMENTS TO MR  COHEN DURING AN INTERVIEW WITH SEAN HANNITY ON FOX NEWS  ONE OF THE PEOPLE SAID THE ABRUPT DISCLOSURE  WHICH EVEN CAUGHT MR  HANNITY  A CONFIDANT OF THE PRESIDENTS  BY SURPRISE  SET OFF A FLURRY OF CALLS BETWEEN MR  TRUMPS LAWYERS AS THEY SOUGHT TO DETERMINE WHETHER MR  GIULIANI MEANT TO REVEAL THE PRESIDENTS REIMBURSEMENT  WITNESSES AND LAWYERS AROUND WASHINGTON SCOURED TRANSCRIPTS  WATCHED TELEVISION CLIPS AND CALLED EACH OTHER IN AN EFFORT TO GRASP THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT MR  GIULIANI HAD SAID THE PRESIDENTS OTHER LAWYERS ULTIMATELY DETERMINED THAT MR  GIULIANI HAD CONSULTED WITH MR  TRUMP  PEOPLE CLOSE TO THEM SAID  BUT WERE LEFT SPEECHLESS ABOUT WHY HE DECIDED TO MAKE THE DISCLOSURE IN SUCH A HIGH PROFILE WAY AND WITHOUT ANY STRATEGY TO HANDLE THE FALLOUT MR  GIULIANI RECOGNIZED THE SITUATION WAS PROBLEMATIC  TWO PEOPLE CLOSE TO HIM SAID  BECAUSE MR  TRUMP HAD PREVIOUSLY SAID ON AIR FORCE ONE THAT HE WAS UNAWARE OF THE HUSH PAYMENTS TO STEPHANIE CLIFFORD  THE ACTRESS WHO PERFORMS AS STORMY DANIELS  HOWEVER  MR  TRUMP AND HIS AIDES SEE LYING TO OR MISLEADING THE NEWS MEDIA AS FAR LESS TROUBLESOME THAN LYING TO INVESTIGATORS  THEY SAID EVEN SOME OF THE PRESIDENTS ADVISERS SAID THEY WERE SKEPTICAL OF MR  GIULIANIS STATEMENTS THAT MR  COHEN ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT  MADE PAYMENTS TO A PORNOGRAPHIC FILM ACTRESS AND WAS REIMBURSED BY THE PRESIDENT ALL WITHOUT MR  TRUMPS KNOWING WHY MR  GIULIANIS DISCLOSURE IS A SIGN OF HOW MR  TRUMPS RESHUFFLED LEGAL TEAM  WHICH NOW INCLUDES A HIGHLY PAID WASHINGTON LAWYER  A FAMOUS FORMER MAYOR  A CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER WHO SPECIALIZES IN RELIGIOUS CASES AND FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTORS  WILL FUNCTION IN THE COMING WEEKS AS THEY SORT OUT WHO TAKES THE LEAD ON REPRESENTING THE PRESIDENT MR  GIULIANI HAS SAID HE IS THE LEAD LAWYER DEALING WITH THE SPECIAL COUNSELS INVESTIGATION IN WASHINGTON  BUT HIS STATEMENTS ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT RELATED TO THE CONTINUING INVESTIGATION IN NEW YORK THAT IS EXAMINING THE CONDUCT OF MR  COHEN  PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT ARE CONCERNED THAT MR  TRUMP AND MR  GIULIANI MAY CREATE MORE PROBLEMS FOR THEMSELVES IF THEY CONSULT ONLY WITH EACH OTHER AND LEAVE OUT THE OTHER LAWYERS WHO MAY KNOW MORE ABOUT THE NUANCES OF THE CASES MR  TRUMP FACES A TWO FRONT BATTLE WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  ONE INVESTIGATION IN NEW YORK INTO MR  COHEN AND THE SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION IN WASHINGTON WHOEVER RUNS THE PRESIDENTS LEGAL DEFENSES WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY ADOPT A MORE AGGRESSIVE STRATEGY THAN THE PREVIOUS TEAM  WHICH WAS LED BY THE WASHINGTON LAWYERS JOHN DOWD AND TY COBB DESPITE THE PRESIDENTS DESIRE TO TAKE ON THE SPECIAL COUNSEL  ROBERT S  MUELLER III  AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  MR  DOWD AND MR  COBB PERSUADED MR  TRUMP TO BUY INTO THEIR STRATEGY OF COOPERATION  THE MORE HELPFUL THE PRESIDENT WAS  MR  DOWD AND MR  COBB TOLD HIM LAST YEAR  THE MORE LIKELY THE INVESTIGATION WOULD CONCLUDE BY YEARS END INSTEAD  THE INVESTIGATION HAS INTENSIFIED  AND THE PRESIDENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT APPROACH WAS A MISTAKE  ACCORDING TO PEOPLE CLOSE TO HIM  CONVINCED THAT THE INVESTIGATION IS A GROWING THREAT TO HIS PRESIDENCY  HE HAS RESORTED TO HIS INITIAL INCLINATION TO FIGHT MR  TRUMP APPEARS TO HOPE THAT MR  GIULIANI  A LIKE MINDED POLITICAL STREET FIGHTER FROM NEW YORK  WILL AID HIS COMBATIVE APPROACH  MR  GIULIANIS COMMENTS ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY WERE AN ATTEMPT TO DO JUST THAT HIS AGGRESSION CARRIED RISKS  BESIDES REVEALING THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD REIMBURSED MR  COHEN  MR  GIULIANI APPEARED TO ADMIT THAT THE PAYMENT TO MS  CLIFFORD JUST BEFORE ELECTION DAY IN 2016 WAS MADE BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE COMING VOTE  THAT COULD BE USED TO ARGUE THAT IT WAS AN ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION IMAGINE IF THAT CAME OUT ON OCTOBER 15  2016  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE  YOU KNOW  LAST DEBATE WITH HILLARY CLINTON  MR  GIULIANI SAID ON THE FOX NEWS PROGRAM FOX   FRIENDS  COHEN DIDNT EVEN ASK  COHEN MADE IT GO AWAY  HE DID HIS JOB VIOLATING CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS CAN BE SERIOUS  JOHN EDWARDS  A FORMER DEMOCRATIC SENATOR AND PRESIDENTIAL

ENTERED INTO A LEGAL AGREEMENT WITH MS  CLIFFORD AND PAID HER WITHOUT MR  TRUMPS KNOWLEDGE  MR  GIULIANI DESCRIBED THAT AS COMMONPLACE  SAYING HE PERFORMED SIMILAR SERVICES FOR HIS OWN CLIENTS  BUT LEGAL ETHICS EXPERTS SAID SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT WAS HIGHLY UNUSUAL AND WOULD ONLY EXPOSE MR  COHEN TO NEW QUESTIONS LAWYERS ARE REQUIRED TO KEEP THEIR CLIENTS FULLY INFORMED OF THEIR ACTIVITIES AND ARE GENERALLY PROHIBITED FROM ADVANCING MONEY TO OR ON BEHALF OF THEIR CLIENTS  SAID DEBORAH L  RHODE  A SCHOLAR ON LEGAL ETHICS AT STANFORD LAW SCHOOL  THIS IS A GUY WHO SAYS HELL TAKE A BULLET FOR THE PRESIDENT  SHE SAID  AND WHAT THEYRE GIVING HIM IS THE LEGAL ETHICS EQUIVALENT OF A BULLET GIULIANI THINKS HES SERVING PRESIDENT TRUMPS INTEREST  SHE SAID  PRESIDENT TRUMPS INTEREST IS NOT THE SAME AS MICHAEL COHENS INTEREST IN HIS TWEETS ON THURSDAY  MR  TRUMP CONTRADICTED HIS EARLIER STATEMENTS THAT HE KNEW OF NO PAYMENT TO MS  CLIFFORD  MR  TRUMP SAID HE PAID A MONTHLY RETAINER TO MR  COHEN AND SUGGESTED THAT THE PAYMENT TO THE ACTRESS COULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION GOVERNMENT WATCHDOG GROUPS WARNED THAT WILLFULLY VIOLATING THE FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE LAWS CAN BE PUNISHED BY A

20180502,business,money,3,VANCOUVER  BRITISH COLUMBIA  AT THE PARIS CLIMATE SUMMIT MEETING IN DECEMBER 2015  CANADAS FRESHLY ELECTED PRIME MINISTER  JUSTIN TRUDEAU  TOOK THE PODIUM BEFORE HIS NEW INTERNATIONAL FAN CLUB AND DECLARED  CANADA IS BACK  MY FRIENDS THE YOUNG  CHARISMATIC MR  TRUDEAU PROMISED SUNNY WAYS  HE WAS IDEALLY POSITIONED TO SHIFT THE COUNTRY TO A GREENER FUTURE  AWAY FROM ITS RELIANCE ON RESOURCE INDUSTRIES AND TOWARD IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH INDIGENOUS PEOPLES WHOSE TERRITORIES ARE IMPERILED BY ENERGY PROJECTS  YET MORE THAN HALFWAY THROUGH HIS MANDATE  HE HAS ADOPTED THE BACKWARD ENERGY AND ECONOMIC POLICIES OF HIS PREDECESSOR STEPHEN HARPER  AN ARDENT FOSSIL FUEL PROMOTER  MR  TRUDEAU HAS REVEALED HIMSELF TO BE NOT A CLIMATE CRUSADER  BUT A PIPELINE PITCHMAN WHO TELLS THE WORLD ONE THING WHILE DOING THE OPPOSITE AT HOME WITHIN A YEAR OF COMMITTING IN PARIS TO AMBITIOUS TARGETS  MR  TRUDEAU AND HIS FEDERAL LIBERAL PARTY HAD RENDERED HIS PLEDGE MEANINGLESS  THE GOVERNMENT APPROVED A PAIR OF HEAVY OIL PIPELINES AND A LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS PLANT  ITS MEMBERS SECRETLY CHEERED AS DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED  AND MOVED TOWARD RESURRECTING THE KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE   TWO OTHER PIPELINE PROJECTS WERE TERMINATED EARLIER IN MR  TRUDEAUS TERM  BUT HE CANT TAKE CREDIT  ONE WAS QUASHED IN COURT AND THE OTHER WAS CANCELED BY THE COMPANY HANGING IN THE BALANCE NOW IS THE TRANS MOUNTAIN PIPELINE EXPANSION FROM EDMONTON  ALBERTA  TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF THIS CITY  THE PROJECT  LED BY A SUBSIDIARY OF THE TEXAS BASED ENERGY COMPANY KINDER MORGAN  AND WITH INVESTMENT FROM CANADIAN BANKS  WOULD TRIPLE THE FLOW OF BITUMEN TO THE COAST TO 890 000 BARRELS A DAY AND PRODUCE A SEVENFOLD BUMP IN TANKER TRAFFIC  A HEAVY OIL SPILL COULD BE CATASTROPHIC FOR CANADAS LARGEST WILD SALMON RUN  MANY WHALE SPECIES AND BRITISH COLUMBIAS MULTIBILLION DOLLAR TOURISM INDUSTRY  THE ESTIMATED CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECT WOULD EQUATE TO ADDING ABOUT 3 MILLION CARS A YEAR TO THE ROAD  ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS HAVE WARRIORED UP THE TRUDEAU GOVERNMENT IS NOW BEING PRESSURED TO ANSWER AN ULTIMATUM BY MONTHS END FROM THE COMPANY  WHICH IS THREATENING TO QUIT THE PROJECT  SAID TO COST 7 4 BILLION CANADIAN DOLLARS  9 BILLION WHILE CAMPAIGNING  MR  TRUDEAU MADE ASSURANCES ABOUT FIXING THE FARCICAL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS FOR PROSPECTIVE ENERGY PROJECTS THAT WAS CULTIVATED BY MR  HARPERS CONSERVATIVES  THE LIBERAL GOVERNMENT LATER ANNOUNCED IT WOULD ADHERE TO THE UNITED NATIONS DECLARATION ON THE RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES  WHICH REQUIRES FREE  PRIOR AND INFORMED CONSENT FROM FIRST NATIONS WHERE AN INDUSTRIAL PROJECT THREATENS THEIR TRADITIONAL LANDS AND WATERS  CANADIANS HAD GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE HE WOULD TAKE REAL STEPS TOWARD CHANGE YET THE PRIME MINISTER WAS ENGAGING IN DOUBLESPEAK ALL ALONG  AS EARLY AS 2014  MR  TRUDEAU STATED HE WAS VERY INTERESTED IN KINDER MORGANS PIPELINE  A YEAR BEFORE  HE HAD TRUMPETED THE KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE IN A SPEECH TO EXECUTIVES AT THE CALGARY PETROLEUM CLUB  HIS BIGGEST GRIPE WITH PRIME MINISTER HARPER WAS LITTLE MORE THAN DIVISIVENESS  WHERE MR  HARPER SOUGHT TO CRIMINALIZE OPPONENTS AS ECO TERRORISTS  MR  TRUDEAUS BIG IDEA WAS TO REBRAND THE ENERGY CONVERSATION WITH FRIENDLINESS AND DIPLOMACY  IT HAS BEEN LONG EVIDENT HE WOULD STAY LOYAL TO A FOSSIL FUEL BASED ECONOMY KINDER MORGANS OPPONENTS IN BRITISH COLUMBIA  THE PROVINCE WHERE THE PIPELINE WOULD TERMINATE  FELT DUMBFOUNDED AND BETRAYED WHEN IN LATE 2016 THE TRUDEAU GOVERNMENT APPROVED THE PROJECT AND THEN DOUBLED DOWN  TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE BEGAN HOLDING MARCHES  INUNDATING SOCIAL MEDIA  SIGNING ACTION PLEDGES AND LAWYERING UP  AFTER THE COMPANY ERECTED RAZOR WIRE FENCES AROUND ITS TERMINAL IN LATE 2017 AND INITIATED PREPARATORY WORK  OPPONENTS ORGANIZED MORE MUSCULAR DEFIANCE  IN MARCH  THE ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE ARRESTED MORE THAN 170 PEOPLE WHO WERE BLOCKING KINDER MORGAN EQUIPMENT  INCLUDING INDIGENOUS DEMONSTRATORS AND THE FEDERAL GREEN PARTY LEADER ELIZABETH MAY THE COMPANY HAS NOW DEMANDED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DELIVER FINAL CERTAINTY ABOUT THE PIPELINES FUTURE BY MAY 31  THE PRIME MINISTER IMMEDIATELY CALLED EMERGENCY MEETINGS WITH HIS CABINET AND THE PREMIERS OF BRITISH COLUMBIA AND ALBERTA  WHO HAVE ANTIPODEAN HOPES FOR THE OUTCOME MR  TRUDEAU NOW HAS ONLY LIMITED OPTIONS  FORGE AHEAD  PREPARING TO USE SUSTAINED POLICE FORCE AGAINST DEMONSTRATORS AND DESIGNATING PUBLIC FUNDS TO MINIMIZE KINDER MORGANS RISK  OR LET THE PROJECT EXPIRE AND MAKE GOOD ON THE PARIS COMMITMENTS ON THE HOME FRONT  MR  TRUDEAU ASSERTS THAT PRESSING FORWARD SERVES THE NATIONAL INTEREST  HE HAS REPEATEDLY DECLARED THE PIPELINE WILL GET BUILT BY CITING A CLAUSE IN CANADAS CONSTITUTION THE GOVERNMENT COULD EMPLOY TO OVERRIDE PROVINCES FOR PROJECTS OF NATIONWIDE IMPORTANCE  YET CANADIANS LARGELY WOULDNT BENEFIT UNDER THIS SCHEME BECAUSE MOST OIL REVENUES DONT FLOW TO PUBLIC COFFERS  RATHER  INCREASINGLY TO FOREIGN COMPANIES  EVEN THE SUPPOSED ASIAN DEMAND HAS BEEN VASTLY EXAGGERATED  EXPORTING RAW BITUMEN ALSO WOULD SHIP AWAY POTENTIAL REFINERY JOBS  AND LEGAL EXPERTS ARGUE THAT SO CALLED NATIONAL INTEREST DOESNT TRUMP ABORIGINAL RIGHTS THAT ARE EQUALLY ENSHRINED IN THE CONSTITUTION BIG FOOTING BRITISH COLUMBIA AND ITS FIRST NATIONS  EVEN IF CONSTITUTIONALLY VIABLE  WOULD LIKELY DAMAGE MR  TRUDEAU POLITICALLY  IS HE WILLING TO TARNISH HIS IMAGE AND CANADAS PEACEFUL REPUTATION BY DEPLOYING THE MILITARY  HES NOW IN A FAMILIAR STANDOFF AGAINST SOME OF THE COUNTRYS MOST TENACIOUS ENVIRONMENTALISTS  REARED IN THE BIRTHPLACE OF GREENPEACE  IN THE 1990S  THE WAR IN THE WOODS PROTESTS AGAINST THE LOGGING OF OLD GROWTH TREES IN CLAYOQUOT SOUND PROMPTED MAJOR CHANGES TO PROVINCIAL FORESTRY POLICY  IT WAS ULTIMATELY NAMED A UNESCO BIOSPHERE RESERVE  FIFTEEN YEARS LATER  PITTING THE ARMY AGAINST INDIGENOUS GRANDMOTHERS AND TEENAGERS SIMPLY FOR PROTECTING THEIR WATERS AND THE EARTH COULD JEOPARDIZE 18 OF HIS PARTYS PARLIAMENTARY SEATS MR  TRUDEAU ALL THE WHILE IS KEEPING UP APPEARANCES ABROAD  LIKE RECENTLY VOWING TO REDOUBLE CLIMATE EFFORTS WITH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON OF FRANCE  THAT SMACKS OF DUPLICITY WHEN A DAY EARLIER HE OFFERED PUBLIC MONEY TO BACKSTOP THE PIPELINE  SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE INVESTMENT  THE COMPANY COULD ATTEMPT CONSTRUCTION WITH MINIMIZED RISK  AND IF THAT FAILS  HEAD HOME WHILE CASTING CANADAS POLITICIANS AS AN INEPT SCAPEGOAT  AND POTENTIALLY SETTING UP A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR LAWSUIT AGAINST CANADA UNDER NAFTA  BUT ITS A LONG SHOT FOR SURETIES SO SOON SALVAGING THE EMBATTLED PIPELINE WITH TAX DOLLARS WOULD BE FOOLISH AND WASTEFUL  IT WONT HALT CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE THAT COULD STRETCH CONSTRUCTION FOR YEARS  NOR BEAT MOUNTING LEGAL CHALLENGES BY SEVEN FIRST NATIONS  TWO CONSERVATION GROUPS AND THE CITIES OF VANCOUVER AND BURNABY  THE LAWSUITS THEMSELVES POSE AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT  CONTENDING ABORIGINAL GROUPS WERE NOT ADEQUATELY CONSULTED  ECOSYSTEMS AND DRINKING WATER COULD BE POLLUTED  AND ORCA AND OTHER ENDANGERED SPECIES WILL BE HARMED   KINDER MORGAN HAS ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED IN DISCLOSURES TO SHAREHOLDERS THAT ITS PERMITS COULD BE VOIDED WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR NOT  MR  TRUDEAU IS LEFT WITH BUT ONE VIABLE OPTION  DISCARD THE PIPELINE AND FOCUS ON GREENER PASTURES  TO CREATE JOBS  HE SHOULD RAMP UP THE ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM HE CAMPAIGNED ON AND PIVOT TO THE ACCELERATING RENEWABLE ENERGY SECTOR MR  TRUDEAU SPEAKS PERSUASIVELY ABOUT CANADAS LEADERSHIP ON CLIMATE  BUT IN REALITY HES TRYING FOR THE IMPOSSIBLE  TO CONVINCE EVERY SIDE THAT HE CAN PLEASE THEM  A PIPELINE WILL EITHER GO IN THE GROUND  OR IT WONT  THE PRIME MINISTER MUST SHOW HES WORTHY OF HIS JOB BEFORE THE 2019 ELECTION AND ACT DECISIVELY  RATHER THAN CHOOSING BETWEEN THE PROVINCES  OR THE OIL LOBBY AND ECO CONSCIOUS VOTERS  HE SHOULD THINK HARD ABOUT WHAT BEST EMBODIES HIS SUNNY WAYS PRINCIPLES

20180501,sports,baseball,2,HOUSTON  ONLY A HANDFUL OF GAMES OVER THE COURSE OF A SIX MONTH SEASON CARRY SIGNIFICANT MEANING AS A STAND ALONE CONTEST  MAYBE IT IS THE CONTEXT OF A PENNANT RACE  THE UNFOLDING OF A REMARKABLE MOMENT OR THE WEIGHT OF HISTORY ONE OF THOSE ARRIVED ON MONDAY FOR THE YANKEES  WHEN THEY TRAVELED HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE AN AGONIZING DEFEAT IN GAME 7 OF THE AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES NOTHING THIS WEEK WOULD ERASE THAT MEMORY  OR THE STING OF WATCHING THE HOUSTON ASTROS GO ON TO WIN THEIR FIRST WORLD SERIES  BUT THE YANKEES  WHO ARRIVED WITH A NINE GAME WINNING STREAK  AT LEAST HOPED TO SHOW THAT THEY HAD PUT THAT PAINFUL MEMORY BEHIND THEM AGAINST A TEAM THAT  LIKE THE YANKEES  BOLSTERED ITS ROSTER WITH AN EYE ON WINNING A CHAMPIONSHIP THIS FALL INSTEAD  MONDAYS GAME LOOKED LIKE A REPRISE HOUSTON STARTER CHARLIE MORTON  WHO PITCHED FIVE SHUTOUT INNINGS IN THE DECISIVE GAME LAST YEAR  WAS ONLY MORE DOMINANT  CARRYING A NO HITTER INTO THE SIXTH INNING OF AN EVENTUAL 2 1 ASTROS VICTORY IT WAS THE SEVENTH CONSECUTIVE LOSS FOR THE YANKEES AT MINUTE MAID PARK  AND THEY HAVE FOLLOWED A FAMILIAR PATTERN  THE YANKEES HAVENT SCORED MORE THAN A SINGLE RUN IN THE LAST SIX OF THOSE GAMES  IT WILL NOT GET ANY EASIER ON TUESDAY NIGHT  THEY FACE ACE JUSTIN VERLANDER  WHO DOMINATED THEM TWICE IN THE PLAYOFFS LAST YEAR THE YANKEES  WHO WERE ALSO SHUT OUT IN GAME 7  A 4 0 LOSS  MANAGED THEIR ONLY RUN ON MONDAY IN THE EIGHTH INNING AFTER MORTON HAD DEPARTED  THEY LOOKED NOTHING LIKE THE OFFENSE THAT LEADS BASEBALL IN RUNS  HOME RUNS  ON BASE PERCENTAGE AND EXTRA BASE HITS EVERYONE WAS AMPED UP ABOUT THIS SERIES  SAID ASTROS CLOSER KEN GILES  WHO STRUCK OUT GIANCARLO STANTON  GARY SANCHEZ AND AARON HICKS TO CLINCH THE GAME  ITS A GREAT TEAM THAT WERE FACING  IT BRINGS BACK A LOT OF MEMORIES  WE WANTED TO PROVE A POINT  WE WANT TO MAKE A STATEMENT OUT THERE THAT WERE THE TEAM TO BEAT  YOUVE GOT TO COME PAST US FIRST THE STATEMENT MAKER OF THE NIGHT WAS MORTON  A 34 YEAR OLD JOURNEYMAN WHOSE LATE CAREER RENAISSANCE CAME WITH A SPIKE IN VELOCITY AND A REFINEMENT OF HIS PITCH SELECTION  HE REACHED A PEAK LAST YEAR IN THE PLAYOFFS  WHEN HE FOLLOWED UP HIS PERFORMANCE AGAINST THE YANKEES WITH TWO MORE DOMINANT GAMES IN THE WORLD SERIES AGAINST THE DODGERS  INCLUDING CLOSING OUT THE CLINCHING GAME 7 HE HAS PICKED UP WHERE HE LEFT OFF THIS SEASON  WITH MONDAYS WIN  HE IMPROVED TO 4 0 AND LOWERED HIS EARNED RUN AVERAGE TO 1 72 CHARLIE ALWAYS HAD THE ABILITY  SAID YANKEES FIRST BASEMAN NEIL WALKER  A TEAMMATE OF MORTONS FOR SEVEN SEASONS IN PITTSBURGH  I THINK HE WAS ALWAYS HIS OWN WORST ENEMY WHEN I PLAYED WITH HIM JUST BECAUSE HE TRIED TO BE TOO PERFECT  OBVIOUSLY HES FOUND A COMFORT ZONE THROWING STRIKES MORTON COULD NOT HAVE LOOKED MORE COMFORTABLE ON MONDAY NIGHT HE DID NOT ALLOW A HIT UNTIL AUSTIN ROMINE POKED A 1 2 FASTBALL PAST FIRST BASEMAN YULI GURRIEL WITH ONE OUT IN THE SIXTH  MORTON  WHO STRUCK OUT 10 AND WALKED TWO  WAS SO DOMINANT THAT THE YANKEES DID NOT EVEN HIT A BALL TO THE OUTFIELD UNTIL WALKER FLEW OUT TO LEFT FOR THE SECOND OUT IN THE EIGHTH THE ONLY OTHER HIT MORTON ALLOWED WAS ON HIS 102ND AND FINAL PITCH OF THE NIGHT  A SINKER THAT GLEYBER TORRES LINED OFF THE BASE OF THE LEFT FIELD WALL FOR A DOUBLE MORTON EASILY HANDLED STANTON  AN OLD NEMESIS  STRIKING HIM OUT TWICE AND RETIRING HIM ON A GROUNDER  STANTON ENTERED THE GAME 9 FOR 18 IN HIS CAREER AGAINST MORTON  THOUGH THEY LAST FACED EACH OTHER IN 2015  WHEN MORTON WAS LARGELY A SINKER BALLER HES THROWING FIVE TO EIGHT MILES AN HOUR HARDER THAN WHEN I SAW HIM LAST  STANTON SAID  YOU DO THAT AND MIX YOUR PITCHES  ITS GOING TO BE A NICE LITTLE BATTLE AFTER TORRES DOUBLED  ASTROS MANAGER A J  HINCH CALLED ON BRAD PEACOCK TO FACE PINCH HITTER AARON JUDGE  WHO TOOK A 3 2 SLIDER OFF THE PLATE FOR A WALK  TORRES STOLE THIRD WITHOUT A THROW ON THE PLAY  WHICH PAID OFF FOR THE YANKEES WHEN BRETT GARDNER FOLLOWED WITH A LINE SINGLE TO RIGHT OFF CHRIS DEVENSKI TO CUT THE ASTROS LEAD TO 2 1 BUT DEVENSKI KEPT THE YANKEES AT BAY BY STRIKING OUT DIDI GREGORIUS ON THREE PITCHES  GREGORIUS  WHO WAS NAMED THE AMERICAN LEAGUE PLAYER OF THE WEEK EARLIER IN THE DAY  IS 0 FOR 11 SINCE HIS GAME WINNING HOME RUN AGAINST THE ANGELS ON FRIDAY NIGHT THE YANKEES HAD A FINE PITCHING PERFORMANCE OF THEIR OWN  AS STARTER SONNY GRAY  WHO ENTERED MONDAY WITH A 7 71 E R A  KEPT THEM IN THE GAME WITH HIS BEST PERFORMANCE OF THE YOUNG SEASON  BOONE SAID THE ROAD MAP FOR GRAY TO GET HIMSELF BACK ON TRACK WAS SIMPLE IT STARTS WITH STRIKE ONE  GETTING AHEAD IN THE COUNT  AND THEN HE CAN START TO USE ALL HIS WEAPONS  BOONE SAID  AND WHEN THATS THE CASE  WE FEEL LIKE HES A DYNAMIC PITCHER BOONES ANALYSIS TURNED OUT TO BE SPOT ON IN SIX INNINGS  GRAYS NIGHT WAS DEFINED ALMOST ENTIRELY BY WHETHER OR NOT HE WORKED FROM AHEAD  WHEN HE GOT A FIRST PITCH STRIKE  ASTROS BATTERS WERE 0 FOR 14  WHEN HE DID NOT  ASTROS BATTERS WERE 4 FOR 8 WITH THREE WALKS  AND WHEN GRAY FELL BEHIND  HE WAS RELUCTANT TO THROW HIS FASTBALL  SOMETHING THE ASTROS SEEMED TO KNOW TRY TO FORCE CONTACT EARLIER IN THE COUNT AND CHALLENGE GUYS  GRAY SAID OF HIS APPROACH  FOR ME  IT WAS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THE ASTROS TOOK A 1 0 LEAD IN THE FIRST AFTER GEORGE SPRINGER SINGLED UP THE MIDDLE  TOOK SECOND ON A BALK AND MADE HIS WAY HOME ON TWO STRIKE GROUNDOUTS BY JOSE ALTUVE AND CARLOS CORREA GRAYS COMMAND SERIOUSLY BETRAYED HIM ONLY IN THE FOURTH WHEN ALTUVE SINGLED  CORREA WALKED ON A 3 2 SLIDER AND GURRIEL HOOKED A 1 0 SLIDER OFF THE LEFT FIELD WALL FOR A DOUBLE THAT SCORED ALTUVE BUT THE YANKEES HELD THE ASTROS THERE  WALKER THREW OUT CORREA AT HOME ON A GROUNDER BY JOSH REDDICK  AND AFTER A WALK TO ALEX BREGMAN  GRAY STRUCK OUT MARWIN GONZALEZ AND RETIRED BRIAN MCCANN ON A LINER TO RIGHT STILL  WITH MORTON IN TOP FORM AND THE ASTROS IN THEIR OWN PARK  IT WAS ALL THEY WOULD NEED
20180506,politics,politics,2,AFONSO DHLAKAMA  THE LEADER OF MOZAMBIQUES MAIN OPPOSITION GROUP  WHO WAS HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR EXCEPTIONAL BRUTALITY BY ITS OFTEN YOUNG SOLDIERS DURING A CIVIL WAR THAT CLAIMED UP TO A MILLION LIVES  DIED ON THURSDAY AT HIS HIDE OUT IN THE GORONGOSA MOUNTAINS IN SOUTHEAST AFRICA  HE WAS 65 THE MOZAMBICAN AUTHORITIES CONFIRMED THE DEATH BUT DID NOT SPECIFY THE CAUSE  NEWS REPORTS SAID IT WAS EITHER DIABETES OR A HEART ATTACK PRESIDENT FILIPE NYUSI  WHO HAD BEEN NEGOTIATING A RAPPROCHEMENT WITH MR  DHLAKAMA  A FORMER GUERRILLA COMMANDER  SAID HE HAD TRIED TO HAVE HIM EVACUATED BY HELICOPTER FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT I COULD NOT  BECAUSE HE WAS IN A PLACE WHERE I COULD NOT HELP  THE PRESIDENT SAID THE IMPACT OF MR  DHLAKAMAS DEATH ON A FRAIL TRUCE  NEGOTIATED IN ADVANCE OF ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 2019  WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY CLEAR MR  DHLAKAMA HAD HEADED THE OPPOSITION RENAMO MOVEMENT FOR ALMOST FOUR DECADES IN MOZAMBIQUE  A FORMER PORTUGUESE COLONY  IN PORTUGUESE  THE GROUPS INITIALS STAND FOR MOZAMBIQUE NATIONAL RESISTANCE MR  DHLAKAMA HAD FOUGHT BRIEFLY WITH THE SOVIET BACKED AND AVOWEDLY MARXIST INSURGENTS WHO TOOK POWER WHEN MOZAMBIQUE GAINED INDEPENDENCE IN JUNE 1975  BUT HE DEFECTED SOON AFTERWARD AND JOINED A DISSIDENT GROUP OPPOSED TO THE DOMINANT MOVEMENT  FRELIMO  MOZAMBIQUE LIBERATION FRONT  LED BY SAMORA MACHEL  THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF INDEPENDENT MOZAMBIQUE DURING THE CIVIL WAR AGAINST THE LEFTIST GOVERNMENT IN MAPUTO  WHICH BEGAN IN 1977 AND ENDED IN 1992  RENAMO WAS CAST AS AN INTERNATIONAL PARIAH  LITTLE MORE THAN A PAWN IN THE COLD WAR ERA CONFLICTS THAT ENDED WHITE MINORITY RULE ACROSS SOUTHERN AFRICA THE GROUP WAS ESTABLISHED WITH THE SUPPORT OF WHITE INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS IN NEIGHBORING RHODESIA  NOW CALLED ZIMBABWE  THEY SAW RENAMO AS A MEANS OF UNDERMINING MOZAMBIQUES ROLE AS A BASE FOR ZIMBABWEAN NATIONALIST GUERRILLAS LED BY ROBERT MUGABE WITH ZIMBABWEAN INDEPENDENCE IN 1980  WHITE RULED SOUTH AFRICA TOOK OVER AS THE CHIEF COVERT BACKER AND ARMS SUPPLIER TO RENAMO  USING IT ONCE MORE AS A FORCE OF DESTABILIZATION  THIS TIME AGAINST PRESIDENT MACHELS SUPPORT FOR THE ANTI APARTHEID AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS  WHICH WAS OPERATING IN EXILE FROM MOZAMBIQUE AND ELSEWHERE IN 1984  PRESIDENT MACHEL WAS FORCED TO SIGN A TREATY WITH SOUTH AFRICA  NAMED THE NKOMATI ACCORD FOR THE AREA WHERE IT WAS SIGNED  IN WHICH HE OFFERED TO WITHDRAW SUPPORT FOR THE A N C  IN RETURN FOR SOUTH AFRICAS ENDING ITS SPONSORSHIP OF RENAMO  THE AGREEMENT WAS BROKEN OFTEN BY BOTH SIDES  AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL SOUTH AFRICAS WHITE RULERS FINALLY PLEDGED TO ABANDON APARTHEID THAT RENAMO OPENED PEACE TALKS WITH THE LEADERSHIP IN MAPUTO BY THAT STAGE  THE TWO SIDES HAD FOUGHT TO A STALEMATE IN A BUSH WAR CHARACTERIZED BY MASSACRES  RAPE AND LOOTING  AT THE SAME TIME  THE DISTANT WORLD BEYOND THE CONFLICT WAS CHANGING FUNDAMENTALLY AS THE COLD WAR DREW TO A CLOSE IN 1988  THE UNITED STATES STATE DEPARTMENT SPONSORED A REPORT ACCUSING RENAMO OF WIDESPREAD ATROCITIES  INCLUDING FORCED LABOR AND ARBITRARY EXECUTIONS  THE REPORT  LIKENING RENAMO TO THE KHMER ROUGE IN CAMBODIA  ACCUSED MR  DHLAKAMAS TROOPS  SOME OF THEM CHILD SOLDIERS  OF A STRING OF MASSACRES  INCLUDING ONE AT HOMOINE  IN WHICH MORE THAN 400 CIVILIANS DIED  MR  DHLAKAMA DENIED THE ACCUSATIONS  INSISTING THAT GOVERNMENT FORCES HAD STAGED ATROCITIES TO DISCREDIT THE DISSIDENTS IF WE WERE JUST A BUNCH OF BANDITS  WE WOULD HAVE BEEN CAUGHT AND BEEN HANDED OVER TO GOVERNMENT FORCES LONG AGO  HE SAID IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE NEW YORK TIMES IN 1988  OUR AIM IS NOT TO WIN THE WAR MILITARILY BUT TO FORCE THE FRELIMO GOVERNMENT TO ACCEPT OUR CONDITIONS FOR ESTABLISHING DEMOCRACY AFONSO DHLAKAMA WAS BORN ON JAN  1  1953  IN THE SOFALA PROVINCE OF CENTRAL MOZAMBIQUE  THE SON OF A TRADITIONAL RULER  HE WAS EDUCATED BY ROMAN CATHOLIC SEMINARIANS IN THE INDIAN OCEAN PORT CITY OF BEIRA  ACCORDING TO THE BATTLE FOR MOZAMBIQUE  A STUDY BY STEPHEN A  EMERSON  AN AMERICAN ANALYST OF AFRICAN AFFAIRS MR  DHLAKAMA WAS CONSCRIPTED INTO THE PORTUGUESE COLONIAL ARMY BUT DESERTED TO JOIN FRELIMO  WHEN HE DEFECTED TO RENAMO  MR  EMERSON WROTE  THE FRELIMO AUTHORITIES SAID MR  DHLAKAMA HAD BEEN DISMISSED FOR CORRUPTION AND MISCONDUCT  ALLEGATIONS HE DENIED MR  DHLAKAMA ROSE RAPIDLY THROUGH THE RENAMO RANKS  AND WHEN ITS LEADER  ANDR MATSANGAISSA  WAS KILLED IN ACTION IN 1979  HE TOOK OVER THE ORGANIZATION AND PRESIDED OVER THE EXPANSION OF ITS RAGTAG ARMY INTO A FORCE NUMBERING UP TO 20 000 GUERRILLAS IN HIS 1988 INTERVIEW  MR  DHLAKAMA SAID THE GUERRILLAS HIT AND RUN STRIKES AGAINST TOWNS HELD BY THE MOZAMBICAN ARMY WERE DESIGNED TO DEMORALIZE AND LOWER THE PROFILE OF THE ENEMY RATHER THAN HOLD TERRITORY  IT SERVES NO PURPOSE TO HOLD TOWNS THAT ARE EMPTY  HE SAID  HIS FORCES ALSO STRUCK AT VITAL REGIONAL TRANSPORT LINKS RENAMO WAS ALWAYS HOSTAGE TO EVENTS BEYOND ITS CONTROL  AS SOUTH AFRICAS SUPPORT FOR THE DISSIDENTS DWINDLED  THE FRELIMO GOVERNMENT DREW ON BACKING FROM ZIMBABWEAN  TANZANIAN AND ZAMBIAN TROOPS  AND PERSUADED A KEY SUPPORTER  MALAWI  TO CEASE AIDING THE REBELS IN 1986  FOR ALL THAT  RENAMOS CONTROL OF SO CALLED LIBERATED RURAL AREAS TURNED MANY REMOTE TOWNS INTO ISLANDS OF GOVERNMENT CONTROL  REACHABLE ONLY BY AIR IN 1992  MR  DHLAKAMA SIGNED A PEACE TREATY WITH THE MOZAMBICAN PRESIDENT  JOAQUIM CHISSANO  AFTER A BLANKET AMNESTY  RENAMO BECAME A LEGAL POLITICAL PARTY BUT RETAINED ITS GUERRILLA FORCE  IN SUCCESSIVE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS  MR  DHLAKAMA CONTESTED ALL OF THEM  THE GOVERNMENTS CANDIDATES WON EVERY VOTE  AND IN 2013  RENAMO SAID IT WAS ABANDONING THE 1992 PEACE ACCORD MR  DHLAKAMA LEFT MAPUTO AND RETURNED TO HIS WARTIME HIDE OUTS IN GORONGOSA  LOSING YET ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN 2014 AND FACING A STRING OF ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS HE ANNOUNCED A TRUCE IN 2016 AND A YEAR LATER HELD TALKS WITH PRESIDENT NYUSI AIMING AT A RECONCILIATION WITH FRELIMO  WHICH HAS HELD POWER WITHOUT INTERRUPTION SINCE MOZAMBIQUES INDEPENDENCE FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF MR  DHLAKAMA  PRESIDENT NYUSI CALLED HIM A CITIZEN WHO ALWAYS WORKED FOR MOZAMBIQUE  NEWS REPORTS SAID I HOPE  HE ADDED  THAT WE AS MOZAMBICANS CAN CONTINUE TO DO EVERYTHING SO THINGS DO NOT GO DOWN

EVEN HAS ITS OWN SEPARATE VOLUME IN THE SHOW S HUGE CATALOG BOLTON SAYS HE REALIZES PEOPLE MAY THINK THERE S SOMETHING UNSEEMLY ABOUT CONNECTING THE COMMERCIAL THEME OF FASHION WITH LOFTY THEME OF RELIGION  BUT  AS HE WRITES IN THE CATALOG   DRESS IS CENTRAL TO ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT RELIGION  IT AFFIRMS RELIGIOUS ALLEGIANCES AND  BY EXTENSION  ASSERTS RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES  AND  HE POINTS OUT  HE ALWAYS WANTS TO CONFRONT TIMELY CULTURAL ISSUES IN HIS EXHIBITIONS HE WAS BACKED UP ON MONDAY MORNING BY NONE OTHER THAN CARDINAL TIMOTHY DOLAN  THE ROMAN CATHOLIC ARCHBISHOP OF NEW YORK  WHO GREETED THE CROWD AT THE OFFICIAL PRESS PREVIEW BY SAYING   YOU MAY BE ASKING  WHAT S THE CHURCH DOING HERE  HE EXPLAINED THAT THE CATHOLIC IMAGINATION EMBODIED NOT ONLY TRUTH AND GOODNESS BUT BEAUTY

PAGEANTRY AND PUBLIC SIDE OF THE CHURCH  THE CLOISTERS SECTION FOCUSES ON THE MORE REFLECTIVE  CONTEMPLATIVE SIDE  BOLTON SAYS HIS ORIGINAL IDEA WAS TO HAVE A MULTI RELIGION EXHIBIT  THAT MAY HAPPEN ONE DAY  BUT HE FOUND SO MUCH MATERIAL RELATING TO CATHOLICISM THAT HE DECIDED TO FOCUS ON THAT AND WHAT OF THE CELEBRITIES WHO WILL BE INTERPRETING THE DRESS CODE ON MONDAY NIGHT  THEY WERE ADVISED THAT THE THEME WAS  SUNDAY BEST IT S AN IMPLICIT PLEA TO DRESS SOMEWHAT MORE MODESTLY  BOLTON QUIPS ONLINE

EXPECT IN THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES WELL SEE WHAT HAPPENS PRESIDENT TRUMP  A NEW TO THE GAME POLITICIAN WHO ONCE CAMPAIGNED ON A PROMISE OF I ALONE CAN FIX IT  HAS SPENT THE PAST MONTH SPEAKING WITH A DECIDEDLY LESS DEFINITIVE STANCE  SHRUGGING OFF A SERIES OF DIPLOMATIC HIGH WIRE ACTS THAT MAY COME TO DEFINE HIS PRESIDENCY WITH A BIT OF WELL WORN TRUMPESE WELL SEE  WHEN A REPORTER ASKED MR  TRUMP ON TUESDAY WHETHER HE DESERVED THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE FOR HIS EFFORTS TO ARRANGE PEACE TALKS BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA WELL SEE WHAT HAPPENS  I OFTEN SAY  THE PRESIDENT SAID A DAY EARLIER ABOUT RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA  APPARENTLY AWARE OF HIS TENDENCY TO TAKE AN INDEFINITE VIEW ON TIMELY NEGOTIATIONS SO THE END RESULT IS  WELL SEE  MR  TRUMP SAID LAST WEEK  AGAIN BROACHING THE SUMMIT MEETING WITH NORTH KOREA AT LEAST TWO DOZEN TIMES IN THE PAST MONTH  THE PRESIDENT APPEARS TO HAVE SHIFTED INTO FULL ON VERBAL TIC MODE  DEPLOYING SOME VARIATION OF WELL SEE WHAT HAPPENS AS A CAST OF WORLD LEADERS FROM FRANCE  THE BALTIC STATES  JAPAN AND NIGERIA ROTATED IN AND OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE OR HIS FLORIDA ESTATE  MR  TRUMPS ONE PERSON GUESSING GAME CAME INTO PLAY AS HE ADDRESSED TOPICS INCLUDING MEXICO  NAFTA  RUSSIA  AMAZON  NORTH KOREA  MIKE POMPEO  DR  RONNY L  JACKSON  IRAN AND THE SPECIAL COUNSELS INVESTIGATION INTO HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC SPEECHWRITERS AND OTHERS WHO STUDY THE PRESIDENTS SPEECH PATTERNS SAY WELL SEE WHAT HAPPENS MAY BE A WAY TO SIGNAL A VEILED THREAT TO UNPREDICTABLE ADVERSARIES  LIKE THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG UN  AMID DELICATE NEGOTIATIONS  BUT MANY WHO WATCH CLOSELY SAY MR  TRUMP IS USING THE PHRASE TO AVOID ACCOUNTABILITY THE OCCASIONS IN WHICH HES MADE SPECIFIC PROMISES  LIKE WELL BUILD A WALL AND MEXICO WOULD PAY FOR IT  HE HAS HAD TROUBLE DELIVERING  KATHLEEN HALL JAMIESON  THE DIRECTOR OF THE ANNENBERG PUBLIC POLICY CENTER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA  INSTEAD OF FORECASTING AND BEING ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE FORECAST  HES OPENING THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE ARE A RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES NOT ANTICIPATED FOR WHICH HE DOES NOT WANT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE MR  TRUMP IS NOT THE FIRST PRESIDENT TO RELY ON A VERBAL CRUTCH TO MAKE A POINT  AVOID CRITICISM OR SKIRT A QUESTION  WHEN FACED WITH PRESSURE  PRESIDENT GEORGE W  BUSH FAMOUSLY REFERRED TO HIMSELF AS THE DECIDER  A PHRASE THOUGHT OF AS THE YOURE NOT THE BOSS OF ME  OF PRESIDENTIAL DECLARATIONS  AND HAD A PENCHANT FOR USING FABULOUS  A DECIDEDLY NON TEXAN ADJECTIVE  TO VOICE HIS APPROVAL  PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN TENDED TO TUG ON HIS EAR AND MUTTER I CANT HEAR IT TO AVOID QUESTIONS SHOUTED AT HIM ON THE WAY TO MARINE ONE  AND PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA OFTEN RELIED ON THE PHRASE LET ME BE CLEAR TO GET HIS AUDIENCES TO PAY ATTENTION DURING SEVERAL OF HIS FIRST TERM SPEECHES  UNTIL PEOPLE STARTED TO CATCH ON TO THE RHETORICAL DEVICE THE MORE PEOPLE HEARD IT  THE LESS EFFECTIVE IT BECAME  ONE OF MR  OBAMAS SPEECHWRITERS  DAVID LITT  SAID IN AN INTERVIEW  WHICH IS ONE REASON THERE WERE FEWER LET ME BE CLEARS IN THE SECOND TERM MR  TRUMP IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PRESIDENTS BECAUSE HE SEEMS TO ENJOY SPEAKING EXTEMPORANEOUSLY ON MATTERS OF CONSEQUENCE  SAID MS  JAMIESON  WHO HAS WRITTEN EXTENSIVELY ABOUT MR  TRUMPS TALENT FOR USING BLUNT LANGUAGE TO SUBVERT POLITICAL NORMS  THAT APPROACH HAS LENT ITSELF TO A COLLECTION OF PRESIDENTIAL FAVORITES  IN TRUMPESE  SHE SAID  MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING MEANS I WISH MANY PEOPLE WERE SAYING THIS BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO BELIEVE THEY ARE  PEOPLE DONT KNOW  SHE SAID  LIKELY MEANS I JUST FOUND OUT  AND BELIEVE ME  ON SOME LEVEL  MAY SIGNAL I HAVE REAL DOUBTS MR  TRUMPS MODERN PREDECESSORS  SHE SAID  TENDED TO ADHERE TO A TIGHTLY SCRIPTED APPROACH  FOR EXAMPLE  SHE HAD A HARD TIME IMAGINING PRESIDENT JOHN F  KENNEDY SAYING WELL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHILE NEGOTIATING HIS WAY THROUGH THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS THE PRESIDENTS WANTED TO ENSURE THAT THEY KNEW WHAT OUTCOMES COULD BE ACHIEVED AND THAT THEIR RHETORIC COULD HELP THEM ACHIEVE THE OUTCOME  SHE SAID  WITH MR  TRUMP  THE SIGNALING FUNCTION IS BEING ERODED  MEANING THAT EVEN WORDS UTTERED BY A COMMANDER IN CHIEF HAVE A WAY OF LOSING THEIR POWER IF THEYRE SAID OFTEN ENOUGH SPEECHWRITERS HAVE OFTEN SOUGHT TO HAMMER OUT SUCH CRUTCHES  AWARE THAT AN AUDIENCES EYES AND EARS BEGIN TO GLAZE OVER IF SUBJECTED TO A RHETORICAL OVERDOSE   EASIER SAID THAN DONE  OF COURSE  WHEN A PRESIDENT DELIGHTS IN VEERING OFF SCRIPT IF YOU KEEP FORCING THE SAME PHRASES INTO PEOPLES EARS ALL THE TIME  PEOPLE START TO WONDER WHAT YOURE ACTUALLY MEANING  MATT LATIMER  A LITERARY AGENT AND FORMER SPEECHWRITER FOR MR  BUSH  SAID IN AN INTERVIEW  HE SAID THE DANGER IN MR  TRUMPS TENDENCY COULD BE  AFTER A WHILE ITS LIKE  HE REALLY DOESNT KNOW WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN  DOES HE MR  LATIMER SAID THAT WHILE MR  TRUMP ENJOYS A STRONG ECONOMY AND POLICY VICTORIES  LIKE TAX CUTS  AIMED AT HIS BASE  ITS PROBABLY EASIER FOR HIM TO SPEAK EXTEMPORANEOUSLY  FOR INSTANCE  OF THE IMPENDING DEADLINE ON NEGOTIATIONS WITH IRAN  MR  TRUMP TWISTED THE PHRASE TO SUIT HIS PENCHANT FOR SHOWMANSHIP  NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IM GOING TO DO ON THE 12TH  ALTHOUGH  MR  PRESIDENT  YOU HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA  BUT WELL SEE  HE SAID DURING A MEETING LAST WEEK WITH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON OF FRANCE BUT MR  LATIMER  WHO SCRIPTED A PRESIDENT THROUGH THE

MERITED A MENTION IN THE LOCAL NEWS MEDIA  BUT WHILE EGYPT IS KNOWN FOR ITS MUMMIES  IRAN CERTAINLY IS NOT  HERE  THE DEAD ARE BURIED IN LOOSE WHITE CLOTH  AND THE BODIES QUICKLY DECOMPOSE THE OPERATOR OF THE EXCAVATOR SNAPPED A SELFIE WITH THE MUMMIFIED CORPSE LAST MONTH AND POSTED IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA  WHERE IT SPAWNED AN ENTICING THEORY THAT SPREAD WIDELY  THE REMAINS MUST BE THOSE OF REZA SHAH PAHLAVI  THE COSSACK BRIGADE OFFICER WHOM THE BRITISH HELPED INSTALL AS SHAH IN 1925  BEGINNING A FAMILY DYNASTY THAT LASTED 54 YEARS THE EXCAVATOR DRIVER WAS BROUGHT IN FOR QUESTIONING  FAMILY MEMBERS TOLD FOREIGN BASED SATELLITE CHANNELS  SOME PEOPLE EVEN SAID HE HAD BEEN ARRESTED  BUT THIS COULD NOT BE INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED IMAGEREZA SHAH PAHLAVI  WHO BECAME SHAH IN 1925 CREDITASSOCIATED PRESSTHE EXCITEMENT BUILT AS NEWS OF THE MUMMY SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY  BECOMING A POPULAR RALLYING POINT AGAINST IRANS CLERICAL GOVERNMENT AND QUICKLY SETTING OFF ALARMS IN HIGH PLACES  PEOPLE STARTED GATHERING AT THE SHRINE  CALLING OUT FOR REZA SHAH  ONE VIDEO SHOWS SUPPORTERS OF THE TEHRAN SOCCER CLUB PERSEPOLIS SHOUTING  LONG LIVE REZA SHAH DURING A GAME PERSIAN LANGUAGE SATELLITE CHANNELS OPERATING FROM ABROAD HERALDED THE DISCOVERY OF THE MUMMY AS A SIGN THAT THE ISLAMIC REPUBLICS DAYS WERE NUMBERED  REZA SHAHS GRANDSON  THE CROWN PRINCE REZA PAHLAVI  WHO LIVES IN THE WASHINGTON SUBURBS  WROTE A STATEMENT CALLING FOR AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION  IN ALL CORNERS OF IRAN  AT SUPERMARKETS  BUS STOPS  CLINICS OR WHEREVER  THE RETURN OF THE SHAH WAS HOTLY DEBATED THIS IS REZA SHAH  NO DOUBT  SAID AKBAR  WHO WAS SELLING ISLAMIC JEWELRY IN THE BAZAAR NEAR THE SHRINE AND WHO REFUSED TO GIVE HIS FAMILY NAME TO AN INQUISITIVE FOREIGNER WHOSE INTENTIONS WERE UNCLEAR  WE IRANIANS ARE SUPERSTITIOUS  AND I PERSONALLY BELIEVE HIS RETURN IS A MESSAGE  THAT MESSAGE IS  CORRECT THE MESS  IN RECENT MONTHS  IRAN HAS HAD PROTESTS OVER THE LAGGING ECONOMY AND AGAINST COMPULSORY ISLAMIC HEAD SCARVES  AT THE SAME TIME  PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS HINTED HE WANTS TO REVISIT THE IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT  WHICH MANY IRANIANS HAD HOPED WOULD PUT THE COUNTRY ON A NORMAL PATH INSTEAD  IRANIANS ARE CAUGHT IN A SEEMINGLY PERPETUAL LIMBO  THERE IS NOSTALGIA FOR THE DAYS BEFORE THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION  WHEN PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER CAME TO IRAN TO MEET WITH SHAH MOHAMMED REZA PAHLAVI  THE SON OF REZA SHAH  INSTEAD OF WEAPONS EXPERTS HAGGLING OVER NUCLEAR CENTRIFUGES  OF COURSE  THERE IS ALSO A BIT OF AMNESIA ABOUT THE SHAHS DESPOTIC TENDENCIES  AND THE ABUSES BY HIS SECRET POLICE  THE SAVAK  WHICH FUELED THE UPRISING THAT OVERTHREW HIM IN 1979 WHILE THE AUTHORITIES REFUSED TO SAY WHETHER THE RECENT DISCOVERY WAS  IN FACT  THE MUMMIFIED REMAINS OF REZA SHAH  MANY IRANIANS TOOK THE OFFICIAL RELUCTANCE  THE LOCATION OF THE FIND AND THE VIRTUAL ABSENCE OF MUMMIES IN THE COUNTRY AS PROOF POSITIVE IT HAS TO BE HIM  MY IRANIAN MOTHER IN LAW CRIED OUT DURING A DEBATE AT THE KITCHEN TABLE  WE IRANIANS DONT DO MUMMIES THEIR REASONING WENT LIKE THIS  WHEN MOHAMMED REZA PAHLAVI AND HIS FAMILY HURRIEDLY LEFT IRAN ON A SUNNY JANUARY DAY IN 1979 AS THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION WAS GATHERING FORCE  THEY LEFT BEHIND TWO LONG DECEASED RELATIVES  ONE  HIS BROTHER  PRINCE ALIREZA PAHLAVI  DIED IN 1954 IN A PLANE CRASH IN THE SNOWY ALBORZ MOUNTAINS OF IRAN AND WAS BURIED AT AN UNKNOWN LOCATION BUT THE GRAVE SITE OF HIS FATHER  REZA SHAH  WHO DIED IN 1944  WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD TO MISS  AN IMPOSING MAUSOLEUM ADJACENT TO THE PARROT GARDEN WHERE THE EXCAVATOR WAS DIGGING LAST MONTH REZA SHAH RULED FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES  MANY HERE CALL HIM THE FATHER OF MODERN IRAN  FOR SINGLE HANDEDLY CARRYING A BACKWARD  MOSQUITO INFESTED COUNTRY INTO THE 20TH CENTURY  HE WENT INTO EXILE IN SOUTH AFRICA AFTER BEING FORCED BY THE BRITISH AND SOVIETS TO ABDICATE IN 1941 IN FAVOR OF HIS SON AFTER HIS DEATH IN JOHANNESBURG IN 1944  HIS BODY WAS TAKEN TO EGYPT  WHERE IT WAS MUMMIFIED AND WHERE IT STAYED UNTIL 1950  WHEN HIS REMAINS WERE BROUGHT BACK TO IRAN THE MAUSOLEUM WHERE REZA SHAH WAS LAID TO REST WAS INSPIRED BY NAPOLEONS IN PARIS  OVER 80 FEET HIGH  IT RIVALS IN SIZE THE SHRINE TO ABDOL AZIM  BUT AFTER THE REVOLUTION  THE FIREBRAND CLERIC SADEGH KHALKHALI  KNOWN AS THE HANGING JUDGE FOR ORDERING THE EXECUTION OF HUNDREDS  HAD THE MAUSOLEUM TORN DOWN  REZA SHAHS BODY WAS SOMEHOW LOST I REMEMBER WHEN THE REVOLUTIONARIES STARTED DEMOLISHING THE MAUSOLEUM  SAID ALI ZAKERI  72  WHO SPENDS MOST OF HIS DAYS IN THE BAZAAR SURROUNDING THE SHAH ABDOL AZIM SHRINE  IT WAS BUILT SO STRONG THAT AFTER A WHOLE DAY OF HAMMERING  THEY ONLY MANAGED TO TAKE THREE CENTIMETERS OFF  HE ADDED  REFERRING TO A BIT MORE THAN AN INCH IT WAS A SUNNY SPRING DAY  AND MR  ZAKERI AND HIS FRIEND WERE DISCUSSING THE ENHANCED POLICE PRESENCE THAT HAD ACCOMPANIED THE CROWDS SWARMING THE NORMALLY PEACEFUL AREA AROUND THE SHRINE  HOPING TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE MUMMY WHEN I SAW THE MUMMY  I KNEW THIS WAS REZA SHAH  SAID THE FRIEND  FARMAN HEMATI  OF THE PHOTOGRAPH THAT HAD CIRCULATED ON SOCIAL MEDIA  HE WAS SITTING NEXT TO A SCALE LIKE THOSE IN OLD FASHIONED ARCADES  WHERE PEOPLE COULD WEIGH THEMSELVES FOR THE EQUIVALENT OF 5 CENTS  ALTHOUGH VERY FEW DID HE THEN PROFFERED A THEORY AS TO WHY THE MUMMY HAD GENERATED SUCH EXCITEMENT I LOST MOST OF MY MONEY AFTER THE REVOLUTION  HE SAID  ADDING THAT THINGS IN IRAN HAD SINCE GONE DOWNHILL  WE NEED A STRONG LEADER  TO SET THINGS STRAIGHT HERE  SOMEONE LIKE REZA SHAH  THE DISCOVERY OF HIS BODY IS A SIGN THAT CHANGE IS COMING FOR IRANS AUTHORITIES  ONE THING WAS CLEAR  THE MUMMY  REGARDLESS OF WHO WAS WRAPPED INSIDE  COULDNT BE IN THE PUBLIC EYE MEASURES WERE TAKEN  PLAINCLOTHES OFFICERS STARTED ROAMING THE SHRINE  SEEKING OUT REZA SHAH AFICIONADOS AND SENDING THEM HOME  ONE RECENT EVENING  AFTER A LARGE GROUP GATHERED  SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED  THE CONSTRUCTION SITE WHERE THE MUMMY WAS FOUND HAS BEEN CORDONED OFF AND THE EXCAVATOR DRIVER WHO TOOK THE SELFIE WAS QUESTIONED  FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE SAID EARLY ON  HASSAN KHALILABADI  THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CULTURAL HERITAGE COMMITTEE OF THE TEHRAN CITY COUNCIL  FLOATED IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE SEMIOFFICIAL NEWS AGENCY ISNA THE IDEA THAT THE MUMMY COULD BE REZA SHAHS  BUT SUCH REMARKS FROM OFFICIALDOM QUICKLY DISAPPEARED FROM LOCAL NEWS SITES  THE MUMMY WAS REBURIED OR TAKEN AWAY  OR PERHAPS  AS ONE OFFICIAL SAID  THE WHOLE THING WAS PHOTOSHOPPED  FROM AN OFFICIAL PERSPECTIVE  IT NEVER HAPPENED IN A NEARBY TEAHOUSE  TWO MEN  ALI AND ARASH  WERE SUCKING ON A WATER PIPE  AS STATE TELEVISION DRONED ON BEHIND THEM  ALI SAID HE WAS A REPRESENTATIVE FOR A CONDOM BRAND  WHILE ARASH SOLD BABY CLOTHES  IT WAS 11 A M  BUT THEY WERE BOTH ALREADY TIRED MANY THINGS IN THE COUNTRY ARE WRONG  SAID ALI  32 OUR MOODS ARE CONSTANTLY SHIFTING  SAID ARASH  32 THEY FELL SILENT REZA SHAH WILL BE THE EXAMPLE OF THE STRONG MAN TO COME  ALI CONCLUDED I DONT THINK SO  ARASH SAID  WE WILL AGAIN FORGET HIM

20180506,politics,politics,6,WASHINGTON  AT A RALLY IN MICHIGAN A LITTLE OVER A WEEK AGO  PRESIDENT TRUMP ASSURED HIS SUPPORTERS THAT HE HAD KEPT HIS PROMISE TO ABOLISH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT  EVEN THOUGH CONGRESS HAD FAILED TO REPEAL THE OBAMA ERA HEALTH LAW ESSENTIALLY  WE ARE GETTING RID OF OBAMACARE  MR  TRUMP SAID  REMINDING A CHEERING CROWD THAT THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE THAT REQUIRED MOST PEOPLE TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE OR PAY A PENALTY WAS SCRAPPED AS PART OF THE REPUBLICAN TAX BILL HE SIGNED INTO LAW LAST YEAR  SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY  ESSENTIALLY  WE HAVE GOTTEN RID OF IT BUT DESPITE MR  TRUMPS LONGSTANDING DESIRE TO UNWIND THE SIGNATURE LEGISLATIVE ACHIEVEMENT OF HIS PREDECESSOR  MANY PARTS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT REMAIN IN PLACE  AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS EVEN ENFORCING SOME OF ITS PROVISIONS MORE AGGRESSIVELY THAN PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA DID  A REALITY THAT HAS ENRAGED BUSINESS GROUPS AND REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS WHO STILL WANT THE LAW OFFICIALLY REPEALED WHILE THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE MAY BE DEAD  THE EMPLOYER MANDATE  THE REQUIREMENT THAT MANY COMPANIES OFFER HEALTH INSURANCE TO THEIR WORKERS OR PAY A PENALTY  IS VERY MUCH ALIVE  UNDER MR  TRUMP  THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE HAS BEEN PURSUING COMPANIES THAT FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THE MANDATE AND  ACCORDING TO THE AGENCY  WAS SENDING PENALTY NOTICES TO MORE THAN 30 000 BUSINESSES AROUND THE COUNTRY BUSINESS GROUPS ARE PUSHING FOR THE I R S  TO STOP ENFORCING THE MANDATE AND HOUSE REPUBLICANS  WHO VOTED TO REPEAL MUCH OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT A YEAR AGO  HAVE PROPOSED LEGISLATION TO ELIMINATE IT  BUT MOST DEMOCRATS OPPOSE MAJOR CHANGES TO THE LAW AND THE REPUBLICAN LEADERS IN THE SENATE HAVE SHOWN NO INTEREST IN TACKLING HEALTH CARE AFTER LAST YEARS STINGING DEFEAT THE EMPLOYER MANDATE REQUIRES COMPANIES WITH MORE THAN 50 FULL TIME EMPLOYEES TO PROVIDE HEALTH BENEFITS TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OR FACE FINES OF MORE THAN  000 PER WORKER  THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE PREDICTED THAT THESE FINES WOULD TOTAL  BILLION IN 2018 THE I R S  IS WORKING ON SETTLEMENTS WITH SOME OF THE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE HAD TECHNICAL ISSUES OR PAPERWORK GLITCHES  ACCORDING TO DAVID KAUTTER  THE TREASURY DEPARTMENTS ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR TAX POLICY AND THE ACTING I R S  COMMISSIONER BUT OTHER COMPANIES THAT HAVE FAILED TO PROVIDE INSURANCE WILL FACE STIFF FINES I THINK IT IS HORRIBLY UNFAIR AND UNJUST  REPRESENTATIVE JODY HICE  A REPUBLICAN FROM GEORGIA WHO HAS BEEN A LEADING VOICE IN THE OPPOSITION TO THE EMPLOYER MANDATE  SAID AT A HEARING WHERE MR  KAUTTER TESTIFIED IN APRIL  WHAT I AM ASKING AT THIS POINT IS FOR THE I R S  TO CONTINUE NOT TO ENFORCE IT  AS IS WHAT TOOK PLACE UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION  HE SAID  REFERRING TO A REPRIEVE THAT WAS GRANTED WHILE BUSINESSES AND THE GOVERNMENT SORTED OUT COMPLIANCE DETAILS SOME LAWYERS CONTEND THAT THE I R S  IS ON SHAKY GROUND IN TRYING TO ENFORCE THE EMPLOYER MANDATE PENALTIES  ARGUING THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT FOLLOWED PROPER PROCEDURES  LIKE NOTIFYING EMPLOYERS THAT THEY WERE IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS CLEARLY STATE THAT A HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGE MUST NOTIFY AN EMPLOYER THAT ONE OR MORE EMPLOYEES QUALIFIED FOR PREMIUM TAX CREDITS BEFORE THE I R S  CAN IMPOSE PENALTIES  SAID CHRISTOPHER E  CONDELUCI  AN EMPLOYEE BENEFITS LAWYER  MOST OF THE EMPLOYERS SUBJECT TO PENALTIES FOR 2015 NEVER RECEIVED THE NOTICES REQUIRED UNDER THE LAW E  NEIL TRAUTWEIN  A VICE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL RETAIL FEDERATION  SAID SOME PENALTIES RESULTED FROM AN EMPLOYERS FAILURE TO CHECK A PARTICULAR BOX ON A GOVERNMENT FORM INDICATING THAT IT HAD OFFERED COVERAGE TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES IN ONE CASE  MR  TRAUTWEIN SAID  A  MILLION PENALTY WAS IMPOSED ON A RESTAURANT CHAIN BECAUSE ONE OF ITS VENDORS HAD FAILED TO CHECK THE PROPER BOX  THE PENALTY WAS NEGOTIATED DOWN TO ZERO  MR  TRAUTWEIN SAID  IT WAS AN INADVERTENT MISTAKE IN FILLING OUT A COMPLICATED NEW FORM JOHN D  ARENDSHORST  AN EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ATTORNEY AT VARNUM  SAID HE HAS BEEN BUSY FIELDING QUESTIONS FROM COMPANIES THAT HAVE RECEIVED PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS FROM THE I R S  AND SAID THE GOVERNMENT HAS SHOWN A WILLINGNESS TO REDUCE PENALTIES WHEN APPROPRIATE  IN ONE CASE  A BUSINESS WITH ABOUT 500 EMPLOYEES RECEIVED AN ASSESSMENT FOR  9 MILLION  THAT WAS ULTIMATELY REDUCED TO  000 BECAUSE THE PENALTY WAS CAUSED BY A COMPUTER ERROR THEY WERE SHOCKED FOR SURE  MR  ARENDSHORST SAID OF THE INITIAL PENALTY LETTER  THEY FELT IT WAS A BIG MISTAKE AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT  THE EMPLOYER MANDATE WAS TO TAKE EFFECT IN 2014  THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DELAYED ENFORCEMENT FOR AN ADDITIONAL YEAR AFTER EMPLOYERS SAID THEY NEEDED MORE TIME TO COMPLY WITH RULES REQUIRING THEM TO REPORT ON THE COVERAGE THEY PROVIDED TO EMPLOYEES  AND THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT NEEDED MORE TIME TO CLARIFY THE REQUIREMENTS  IT WAS NOT UNTIL LATE LAST YEAR THAT THE I R S  HAD THE CAPACITY TO DETERMINE WHICH BUSINESSES WERE IN VIOLATION OF THE MANDATE  AND THE AGENCY IS JUST NOW SENDING PENALTY LETTERS RELATED TO THE 2015 TAX YEAR  PENALTY LETTERS FOR THE 2016 AND 2017 TAX YEARS ARE EXPECTED TO FOLLOW SOON REPUBLICANS CRITICIZED THE DECISION TO BEGIN ENFORCING THE MANDATE AS A PARTING SHOT BY THE FORMER I R S  COMMISSIONER JOHN KOSKINEN  WHOM THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY ASSAILED OVER THE AGENCYS SCRUTINY OF CONSERVATIVE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS  WHILE MR  TRUMP HAD ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT CALLED FOR EASING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACTS REGULATIONS  THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT  WHICH OVERSEES THE I R S  SAID IT WAS REQUIRED TO ABIDE BY THE LAW AND ENFORCE THE EMPLOYER MANDATE MR  KOSKINEN PUSHED BACK AGAINST THE IDEA THAT HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO PUNISH CONSERVATIVES BY JUMP STARTING ENFORCEMENT OF THE EMPLOYER MANDATE  AND HE SAID THAT COMPANIES HAD BEEN GIVEN PLENTY OF NOTICE THAT THEY NEEDED TO PROVIDE INSURANCE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES THE I R S  DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY NOT TO COLLECT THE MONEY  MR  KOSKINEN SAID IN AN INTERVIEW  ADDING THAT THERE WAS NO REASON TO HOLD OFF ON PENALIZING COMPANIES  DELAYING WOULDNT ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING EXCEPT DELAY BUSINESS GROUPS HAVE BEEN LOBBYING CONGRESS TO REPEAL THE EMPLOYER MANDATE OR TO GET THE I R S  TO STOP ENFORCING IT  THEY ARGUE THAT COMPANIES DID NOT RECEIVE SUFFICIENT NOTICE THAT THEY NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH A PROVISION OF THE HEALTH LAW THAT HAD NOT BEEN ENFORCED FOR SEVEN YEARS THE EMPLOYER MANDATE ALWAYS EXISTED TO SUPPORT THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE  SAID JIM KLEIN  PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN BENEFITS COUNCIL  THERES NO LOGIC OR FAIRNESS IN HAVING AN EMPLOYER MANDATE IN THE ABSENCE OF HAVING AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE MR  KLEIN SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LEGISLATIVE FIX TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION MR  TRUMP HIMSELF HAS ADDED TO THE CONFUSION OVER THE MANDATE BY REPEATEDLY ASSERTING THAT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAD BEEN ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATED BECAUSE REPUBLICANS DID AWAY WITH THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE ITS YET ANOTHER REASON WHY THE EMPLOYER MANDATE NEEDS TO GO  REPRESENTATIVE KEVIN BRADY OF TEXAS  THE REPUBLICAN CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE  SAID OF THE PENALTIES

20180502,business,business,7,ON MONDAY  THE TIMES GAVE US THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF 49 QUESTIONS THE SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER COULD ASK PRESIDENT TRUMP  AS TOLD TO MR  TRUMPS LEGAL TEAM DURING NEGOTIATIONS FOR AN INTERVIEW  THE QUESTIONS REVEAL THE TOPICS MR  MUELLER BELIEVES COULD LEAD TO POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR THE PRESIDENT AND HELP EXPLAIN WHY TRUMPS TEAM HAS URGED HIM NOT TO AGREE TO AN INTERVIEW LAST NIGHT  WE LEARNED THAT THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS WERE ACTUALLY CREATED BY A TRUMP LAWYER  JAY SEKULOW  HIS INTERPRETATION OF 16 SPECIFIC SUBJECTS PRESENTED BY MR  MUELLERS TEAM  MR  SEKULOW BROKE DOWN THE SUBJECTS AND SUBTOPICS INTO THE SEPARATE QUESTIONS  THIS EXPLAINS WHY MR  TRUMPS TEAM HAD THESE QUESTIONS  IT WOULD BE HIGHLY UNUSUAL FOR A PROSECUTOR TO GIVE A WITNESS QUESTIONS IN ADVANCE  BUT IT IS FAIRLY COMMON FOR A PROSECUTOR TO PREVIEW POTENTIAL TOPICS FOR A DEFENSE ATTORNEY BEFORE AN INTERVIEW  FOR THAT REASON  I THINK ITS FAIR TO ASSUME THAT MR  SEKULOWS QUESTIONS TRACK WHAT MR  MUELLERS TEAM WANTS TO COVER IN AN INTERVIEW MR  TRUMPS TEAM PLANS TO USE THE QUESTIONS TO ATTACK THE SPECIAL COUNSEL AS OVERREACHING AND GOING BEYOND HIS MANDATE  BUT THE QUESTIONS THEMSELVES SUGGEST THAT MR  MUELLER HAS CAREFULLY STAYED WITHIN HIS BOUNDS  THEY CONTAIN NOTHING ABOUT OBSCURE BUSINESS DEALS OR REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS  THE QUESTIONS FOCUS ON COORDINATION WITH RUSSIA  OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE AND TOPICS THAT HAVE BEEN COVERED AT LENGTH IN THE NEWS MEDIA  NONE OF THE TOPICS SHOULD HAVE COME AS A SURPRISE TO MR  TRUMPS TEAM  ASIDE FROM AN EXPLOSIVE QUESTION ABOUT EFFORTS BY THE FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN PAUL MANAFORT TO SEEK AID FROM THE KREMLIN  WHICH IS SQUARELY ABOUT COORDINATION WITH RUSSIA WHAT SHOULD CONCERN MR  TRUMPS TEAM IS HOW THE QUESTIONS ZERO IN ON MR  TRUMPS CRIMINAL LIABILITY  THEY LEAVE LITTLE DOUBT THAT MR  TRUMP IS IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY  PARTICULARLY REGARDING OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE  I CONCLUDED MONTHS AGO THAT MR  MUELLER WOULD LIKELY DETERMINE THAT THE PRESIDENT OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE  BUT THE QUESTIONS SHOW THAT MR  MUELLER HAS ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT HOW HE WOULD PROVE HIS CASE  THE QUERIES ASK ABOUT MR  TRUMPS STATE OF MIND WHEN HE FIRED JAMES COMEY  WHEN HE ERUPTED IN ANGER AT ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS FOR RECUSING HIMSELF AND WHEN HE CONSIDERED FIRING THE SPECIAL COUNSEL  THE QUESTIONS ARE INTENDED TO PROVE THE CASE AGAINST MR  TRUMP THROUGH HIS OWN WORDS BUT IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO COUNT THE NUMBER OF QUESTIONS FOCUSED ON OBSTRUCTION AND CONCLUDE THAT MR  MUELLERS INVESTIGATION OF THE PRESIDENT FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON THAT TOPIC  THE INQUIRIES ON TOPICS OTHER THAN OBSTRUCTION ARE BROAD  FOR EXAMPLE  THE QUESTION WHAT DISCUSSIONS DID YOU HAVE DURING THE CAMPAIGN REGARDING ANY MEETING WITH MR  PUTIN  ENCOMPASSES A LOT OF GROUND  YOU COULD ASK A SIMILAR BROAD QUESTION REGARDING THE COMEY FIRING  WHAT DISCUSSIONS DID YOU HAVE ABOUT OR WITH JAMES COMEY   AND COVER MUCH OF THE GROUND COVERED IN THE 18 QUESTIONS RELATED TO HIM THE FACT THAT THE QUESTIONS ON TOPICS OTHER THAN OBSTRUCTION ARE SO BROAD DOES NOT NECESSARILY SUGGEST THAT MR  MUELLER HAS LESS EVIDENCE REGARDING THOSE TOPICS  A MORE LIKELY POSSIBILITY IS THAT MR  MUELLER IS NOT WILLING TO TIP HIS HAND ON THOSE TOPICS BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE HE HAS REGARDING THEM HASNT BEEN EXTENSIVELY COVERED IN THE PRESS THE PRESIDENTS TEAM COULD HAVE GATHERED EVIDENCE OF OBSTRUCTION THEMSELVES  AS I DID  BECAUSE MR  TRUMPS TWEETS AND PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT MR  COMEY ARE WELL KNOWN  BUT IT WOULD BE MUCH HARDER FOR HIS TEAM TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT EVIDENCE MR  MUELLER HAS REGARDING THE TRUMP TOWER MEETING  AND MR  MUELLER WOULDNT WANT TO DISCLOSE WHAT HE KNOWS BEFORE THE INTERVIEW AGAIN  ITS WORTH REMEMBERING THAT MR  TRUMPS TEAM  NOT MR  MUELLER  REPORTEDLY DEVISED THESE QUESTIONS  MR  MUELLER MAY HAVE MERELY RESPONDED TO SPECIFIC INQUIRIES FROM THE TRUMP TEAM  AND THEY MIGHT HAVE ASKED ABOUT FEWER SPECIFIC EVENTS RELATED TO OTHER TOPICS IF MR  TRUMP DOES NOT AGREE TO AN INTERVIEW  MR  MUELLER IS REPORTEDLY CONSIDERING SUBPOENAING HIM TO TESTIFY BEFORE A GRAND JURY  THE PRESIDENTS LAWYERS ARE CONSIDERING WHETHER TO CHALLENGE MR  MUELLERS AUTHORITY TO SUBPOENA MR  TRUMP FOR AN INVESTIGATION OF POTENTIAL CRIMES HE COMMITTED WHILE IN OFFICE  NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER CHALLENGED A PROSECUTORS RIGHT TO SUBPOENA HIM TO TESTIFY IN COURT  ALTHOUGH BILL CLINTON RECEIVED A GRAND JURY SUBPOENA FOR HIS TESTIMONY  IT WAS WITHDRAWN AFTER HE AGREED TO AN INTERVIEW MR  TRUMPS CLAIM WOULD BE NOVEL  BUT THE SUPREME COURT DENIED RICHARD NIXONS CHALLENGE TO A SUBPOENA FOR DOCUMENTS AND TAPES AS WELL AS MR  CLINTONS REQUEST TO POSTPONE A CIVIL LAWSUIT DURING HIS PRESIDENCY  THE SUPREME COURT WOULD LIKELY RULE AGAINST MR  TRUMP  BUT HE COULD USE THE CHALLENGE TO DELAY MR  MUELLERS INVESTIGATION AND HIS OWN TESTIMONY  WHICH EXPLAINS WHY MR  MUELLER IS TRYING TO NEGOTIATE A VOLUNTARY INTERVIEW WHAT IS HARDEST TO KNOW IS WHY MR  MUELLER IS SEEKING AN INTERVIEW OF MR  TRUMP AT WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN EARLY STAGE OF THE INVESTIGATION  TYPICALLY PROSECUTORS WAIT UNTIL THE END OF AN INVESTIGATION TO INTERVIEW THEIR MOST IMPORTANT WITNESS  BECAUSE THEY UNCOVER ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE AS THE INVESTIGATION PROGRESSES  SO DOES THIS MEAN THAT MR  MUELLERS INVESTIGATION IS WRAPPING UP SOON  OR DOES IT MEAN THAT HE IS CONSIDERING SPLITTING HIS INVESTIGATION INTO PHASES  WITH A REPORT AT THE END OF EACH PHASE  IM SKEPTICAL THAT HELL DO THAT  WHAT IF HE UNCOVERS NEW EVIDENCE IN PHASE 2 THAT CHANGES HIS VIEW OF SOMETHING HE INVESTIGATED IN PHASE 1 THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION FOR THE EARLY INTERVIEW IS THAT MR  MUELLER THINKS HIS CHANCES OF GETTING THE PRESIDENT TO AGREE TO AN INTERVIEW WILL DECREASE OVER TIME  MR  TRUMP COULD AT SOME POINT DECIDE TO TAKE THE FIFTH TO AVOID TESTIMONY  DESPITE ANY POLITICAL DOWNSIDE THE POTENTIAL QUESTIONS WE SAW THIS WEEK EXPLAIN WHY MR  TRUMP IS SO CONCERNED ABOUT HIS CRIMINAL LIABILITY  HE FACES DIFFICULT QUESTIONS  NOT JUST ABOUT OBSTRUCTION BUT ALSO ABOUT A HOST OF TOPICS RELATED TO COORDINATION WITH RUSSIA  AND HIS LAWYERS APPEAR CONVINCED THAT HE CANNOT ANSWER THEM WITHOUT PUTTING HIMSELF IN FURTHER JEOPARDY
20180503,business,economy,1,REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES HAVE PRETTY MUCH STOPPED TALKING ABOUT THEIR PARTYS ONLY MAJOR LEGISLATIVE ACHIEVEMENT UNDER DONALD TRUMP  THE 2017 TAX CUT  ADS TOUTING THE TAX LAW HAVE LARGELY VANISHED FROM THE AIRWAVES  BUT THE KOCH BROTHERS  BIG BOOSTERS OF THE CUT AND AMONG ITS BIGGEST BENEFICIARIES  HAVENT GIVEN UP THEIR LATEST MOVE  SPENDING  MILLION TO MOBILIZE AN ARMY OF SALESPEOPLE WHO ARE GOING DOOR TO DOOR TRYING TO DISABUSE VOTERS OF THE PERCEPTION THAT THE TAX CUT WAS A BIG GIVEAWAY TO THE WEALTHY  OFFERING LITTLE TO ORDINARY WORKING FAMILIES BUT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM  PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS ABOUT WHO BENEFITS FROM THE TAX CUT  AND WHO DOESNT  ARE ACCURATE  A POINT APPLE JUST NICELY DEMONSTRATED WITH ITS ANNOUNCEMENT OF A HUGE STOCK BUYBACK TO BE FAIR  THE NOTION THAT A BIG TAX CUT FOR CORPORATIONS  WHICH WAS THE MAIN ELEMENT OF LAST YEARS LAW  MIGHT EVENTUALLY REDOUND TO THE BENEFIT OF WORKERS ISNT CRAZY  BUT THE TWO KEY WORDS HERE ARE MIGHT AND EVENTUALLY THE STORY TAX CUT BOOSTERS TELL RUNS AS FOLLOWS  AMERICA IS PART OF A GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKET IN WHICH CAPITAL FLOWS WHEREVER IT YIELDS THE HIGHEST AFTER TAX RATE OF RETURN  BY CUTTING TAXES ON CORPORATIONS  TRUMP AND HIS ALLIES HAVE GIVEN CORPORATIONS AN INCENTIVE TO INVEST HERE  INVESTMENT WILL EXPAND CAPACITY  DRIVING UP THE DEMAND FOR WORKERS AND THUS LEAD TO HIGHER WAGES AND FOR A LITTLE WHILE APPLE SEEMED TO BE FOLLOWING THE SCRIPT  BACK IN JANUARY THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD BE BRINGING MOST OF THE  BILLION IN CASH IT WAS HOLDING ABROAD BACK TO AMERICA BUT WHAT DOES BRINGING MONEY TO AMERICA MEAN  APPLE DIDNT HAVE A HUGE  SCROOGE MCDUCK STYLE PILE OF GOLD SITTING IN IRELAND  WHICH IT LOADED ONTO A HOMEWARD BOUND SHIP  IT HAS DIGITAL CLAIMS  A BUNCH OF ZEROS AND ONES ON SOME SERVER SOMEWHERE  WHICH IN EFFECT USED TO BEAR A LABEL SAYING THIS MONEY IS IN IRELAND  NOW IT HAS CHANGED THE LABEL TO SAY THIS MONEY IS IN AMERICA  WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THIS MAKE WELL  IT ALTERS THE COMPANYS TAX LIABILITIES TO THE U S  AND IRISH GOVERNMENTS  WHICH WAS THE POINT OF THE CHANGE  BUT OTHERWISE IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL WHAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE WOULD BE IF APPLE CHOSE TO SPEND MORE ON ACTUAL STUFF  HIRING MORE WORKERS  BUILDING NEW STRUCTURES  INSTALLING MORE EQUIPMENT  BUT IT ISNT DOING ANY OF THESE THINGS  INSTEAD  THIS WEEK IT ANNOUNCED THAT ITS BUYING BACK  BILLION OF ITS OWN STOCK  WHICH IS GOOD FOR STOCKHOLDERS BUT DOES NOTHING FOR WORKERS  LOTS OF OTHER COMPANIES ARE DOING THE SAME THING AND WHILE MANY AMERICANS OWN SOME STOCKS  THE GREAT BULK OF STOCK VALUE IS HELD BY A SMALL  WEALTHY MINORITY  10 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION OWNS 84 PERCENT OF THE MARKET  SO THE PERCEPTION THAT THIS IS BASICALLY A TAX CUT FOR THE RICH IS RIGHT BUT WHY ARENT THE BENEFITS OF THE TAX CUT FLOWING TO WORKERS ONE ANSWER IS THAT EVEN IF THE PRO TAX CUT STORY WERE TRUE FOR THE LONG RUN  IT WOULD TAKE MANY YEARS OF EXTREMELY HIGH INVESTMENT TO ACHIEVE THE KIND OF CAPACITY EXPANSION THAT WOULD CAUSE MAJOR WAGE GAINS  ANOTHER IS THAT THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKET ISNT AS GLOBAL AS ALL THAT  THE INVESTMENT WORLD  WE MIGHT SAY  IS STILL A LONG WAY FROM BEING FLAT  AMERICA IS A HUGE ECONOMY  AND EVEN IN THE LONG RUN IT CANT ATTRACT THE KIND OF CAPITAL INFLOWS TAX CUT ENTHUSIASTS ENVISION WITHOUT OFFERING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RATES OF RETURN  WHICH MEANS MORE FOR STOCKHOLDERS AND LESS FOR WORKERS AND AT A DEEPER LEVEL  TAX CUT ENTHUSIASTS MAY HAVE A FUNDAMENTALLY OUT OF DATE VIEW ABOUT WHERE PROFITS COME FROM IN THE WORLD ACCORDING TO TRUMP OFFICIALS  OR RIGHT WING THINK TANKS LIKE THE TAX FOUNDATION  CORPORATE PROFITS ARE BASICALLY A RETURN ON PHYSICAL CAPITAL  ON BRICKS AND MORTAR AND MACHINES  CUT TAXES  AND COMPANIES WILL ADD MORE PHYSICAL CAPITAL  INCREASING COMPETITION FOR LABOR  AND PROFITS WILL GO DOWN WHILE WAGES GO UP APPLE  HOWEVER  IS NOTHING LIKE THAT  ITS PROFITS COME FROM ITS MARKET POSITION  ITS BRAND  IF YOU LIKE  IT DOESNT MATTER WHETHER YOU THINK IT DESERVES ITS ROLE AS A QUASI MONOPOLIST  WHAT MATTERS IS THAT GIVEN ITS POSITION  IT CAN AND DOES CHARGE WHAT THE MARKET WILL BEAR  PRETTY MUCH REGARDLESS OF COSTS  IF TRUMP CUTS ITS TAXES  IT GETS TO KEEP MORE OF ITS PROFITS  BUT IT HAS NO REAL INCENTIVE TO CHANGE ITS BEHAVIOR BY  SAY  BUILDING MORE APPLE STORES  IT JUST TAKES THE EXTRA MONEY AND EITHER SITS ON IT OR HANDS IT BACK TO STOCKHOLDERS VIA BUYBACKS AND THESE DAYS A LOT OF CORPORATE AMERICA IS AT LEAST A BIT LIKE APPLE  NOT ALL OF IT  THERE ARE STILL BUSINESSES  SAY  TRUCKING COMPANIES  WHOSE VALUE RESIDES LARGELY IN THE STUFF THEY OWN  BUT ECONOMIC RENTS  PROFITS NOT TIED TO PHYSICAL CAPITAL  ARE A BIG  GROWING STORY  AND WHEN YOU CUT TAXES ON RENTS  THERES NO REASON AT ALL TO EXPECT WORKERS TO SHARE THE BOUNTY  EVEN IN THE LONG RUN THE BOTTOM LINE  WHICH WILL REMAIN TRUE NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE KOCHS SPEND TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU OTHERWISE  IS THAT WHAT LOOKS LIKE A BIG GIVEAWAY TO WEALTHY INVESTORS IS  IN FACT  A BIG GIVEAWAY TO WEALTHY INVESTORS
20180503,business,economy,7,BEIJING  AS NORTH KOREA HOLDS SUMMIT MEETINGS WITH ITS ARCHENEMIES  FIRST SOUTH KOREA  AND SOON THE UNITED STATES  CHINA IS HUSTLING NOT TO LOSE INFLUENCE ITS FOREIGN

FRIEND CHINA HOLDS SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC LEVERAGE  BUT IN THE HEIGHTENED STRATEGIC COMPETITION BETWEEN IT AND THE UNITED STATES  IT WORRIES THAT MR  KIM IS USING THAT RIVALRY TO REDUCE DEPENDENCE ON

RESTRICTIONS  BUSINESSMEN IN THE AREA OF NORTHEASTERN CHINA THAT BORDERS NORTH KOREA SAY THAT SOME NORTH KOREAN WORKERS ARE RETURNING TO CHINA ON SHORT TERM VISAS  AND THAT THEY EXPECT TRADE TO PICK UP SOON I CAN IMAGINE CHINA ALREADY STARTING STUDIES INTO OPTIONS TO INCREASE ECONOMIC COOPERATION WITH NORTH KOREA IN AREAS THAT WOULD NOT VIOLATE EXISTING UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS  MR  ZHAO SAID BEIJING WAS MIFFED AND SURPRISED AT BEING POINTEDLY EXCLUDED FROM SEVERAL ITEMS IN THE JOINT DECLARATION THAT NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA ISSUED LAST FRIDAY AT THE END OF THEIR SUMMIT MEETING THE TWO KOREAS SAID THEY WOULD START TALKS WITH WASHINGTON TO NEGOTIATE A PEACE TREATY TO FORMALLY END THE KOREAN WAR  WHICH RAVAGED THE PENINSULA FROM 1950 TO 1953 THE DECLARATION MENTIONED TRILATERAL OR QUADRILATERAL TALKS  IF THE TALKS WERE TRILATERAL THAT WOULD INCLUDE NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA AND THE UNITED STATES BUT NOT CHINA  WHICH SENT MILLIONS OF TROOPS TO FIGHT ON NORTH KOREAS SIDE DURING THE WAR  CHINA WITHDREW ALL ITS TROOPS IN 1958 THE CHINESE HEARD IT WAS NORTH KOREA THAT GOT THE TALKS TO BE BROADENED TO QUADRILATERAL  SAID PAUL HAENLE  DIRECTOR OF THE CARNEGIE TSINGHUA CENTER FOR GLOBAL POLICY BEYOND THAT  CHINA WAS NOT INVITED TO SEND OBSERVERS TO THE PLANNED DESTRUCTION OF THE PUNGGYE RI NUCLEAR TEST SITE IN NORTH KOREA AT THE END OF THIS MONTH  MR  KIM SAID HE WOULD INVITE SOUTH KOREAN AND AMERICAN EXPERTS TO WITNESS THE SHUTDOWN  A GESTURE THAT AMERICAN OFFICIALS SAID WOULD HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON THE NORTHS NUCLEAR AND BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAMS THE TEST SITE IS CLOSE TO THE CHINESE BORDER  MR  HAENLE SAID  THE CHINESE WERE UPSET BECAUSE CHINA IS A NUCLEAR POWER  SOUTH KOREA IS NOT DESPITE THESE SNUBS  THE VISIT OF THE FOREIGN MINISTER  MR  WANG  WAS

AND DERAILED THE RELATIONSHIP TO CHINA BY ORDERING THE KILLING OF SENIOR KOREAN OFFICIALS CLOSE TO BEIJING MR  KIM MADE A SURPRISE VISIT TO BEIJING IN LATE MARCH  APPARENTLY ON HIS OWN INITIATIVE  MANEUVERING IN A WAY THAT MADE HIM LOOK LESS LIKE A SUPPLICANT AND MORE LIKE AN EQUAL MR  TRUMPS MEETING WITH MR  KIM IS LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE IN THE DEMILITARIZED ZONE AT THE BORDER BETWEEN SOUTH AND

PRESIDENT TRUMP  AND APPLE PIONEERED THE MODERN SMARTPHONE  A DEVICE INCREASINGLY SEEN AS TOO ADDICTING THEN THERES MICROSOFT  A GIANT THAT SPENT MOST OF THE 1990S AND EARLY 2000S AS TECHS BIGGEST COMPANY AND VILLAIN  IT NOW SEEMS TO BE AUDITIONING FOR A DIFFERENT ROLE  THE INDUSTRYS MORAL CONSCIENCE AMONG THE FIVE MOST VALUABLE TECH COMPANIES  MICROSOFT IS THE ONLY ONE TO AVOID SUSTAINED PUBLIC CRITICISM ABOUT CONTRIBUTING TO SOCIAL ILLS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS  AT THE SAME TIME  SATYA NADELLA  ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE  AND BRAD SMITH  ITS PRESIDENT  HAVE EMERGED AS SOME OF THE MOST OUTSPOKEN ADVOCATES IN THE INDUSTRY FOR PROTECTING USER PRIVACY AND ESTABLISHING ETHICAL GUIDELINES FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY LIKE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON MONDAY  THE CONSCIENTIOUS SIDE OF MICROSOFT WAS ON DISPLAY AGAIN AT BUILD  A THREE DAY CONFERENCE FOR DEVELOPERS IN SEATTLE  MR  NADELLA ANNOUNCED A PROGRAM  A I  FOR ACCESSIBILITY  THAT WILL AWARD  MILLION OVER FIVE YEARS TO RESEARCHERS

MAKE HIM MORE EMPATHETIC ECHOING A THEME HE TALKED ABOUT AT THE CONFERENCE LAST YEAR  MR  NADELLA SAID THE INDUSTRY HAD A RESPONSIBILITY TO BUILD TECHNOLOGY THAT EMPOWERED EVERYONE WE NEED TO ASK OURSELVES NOT ONLY WHAT COMPUTERS CAN DO BUT WHAT COMPUTERS SHOULD DO  HE SAID MICROSOFTS NEW ROLE IS PARTLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE COMPANY ISNT A MAJOR PLAYER IN SOCIAL MEDIA  VIDEO STREAMING AND SMARTPHONES  THE PRODUCTS BEHIND THE CURRENT DARK MOOD AROUND TECH  IT NO LONGER SQUEEZES THE OXYGEN OUT OF MARKETS AS AMAZON CAN BUT WHILE THE COMPANYS POWER HAS DIMINISHED SINCE A COUPLE OF DECADES AGO  WHEN IT CONTROLLED COMPUTING THROUGH WINDOWS  MICROSOFT REMAINS AN INFLUENTIAL VOICE  ON MONDAY  ITS MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF  BILLION MADE IT THE THIRD MOST VALUABLE TECHNOLOGY COMPANY  BEHIND APPLE AND AMAZON AND AHEAD OF GOOGLE PARENT COMPANY  ALPHABET  AND FACEBOOK THE IRONY FOR MICROSOFT IS THAT THEY LOST IN SEARCH  THEY LOST IN SOCIAL NETWORKS AND THEY LOST IN MOBILE  AND AS A CONSEQUENCE  THEY HAVE AVOIDED THE RECENT PUSHBACK FROM GOVERNMENTS AND MEDIA  SAID DAVID YOFFIE  A PROFESSOR AT THE HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL  THIS HAS GIVEN MICROSOFT THE FREEDOM TO TAKE THE HIGH ROAD AS THE ETHICAL LEADER IN TECHNOLOGY SINCE TAKING THE REINS AT MICROSOFT IN 2014  MR  NADELLA HAS BROUGHT A MORE SENSITIVE STYLE OF LEADERSHIP TO THE COMPANY THAN HIS TWO PREDECESSORS  STEVE BALLMER AND BILL GATES  THAT SHIFT HAS PROVED TO BE MORE SUITABLE FOR MICROSOFT IN THIS ERA TWO DECADES AGO  MICROSOFT WAS DEPICTED AS A BULLY THAT RAN ROUGHSHOD OVER COMPETITORS IN A LANDMARK ANTITRUST SUIT BROUGHT BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  FOLLOWED BY SIMILAR CASES BROUGHT BY THE EUROPEAN UNION AND PRIVATE COMPANIES  MR  SMITH WAS BROUGHT IN TO MAKE PEACE IN MICROSOFTS ANTITRUST BATTLES  AND MR  NADELLA WAS THE COMPANYS FIRST CHIEF EXECUTIVE TO START IN THE JOB SINCE THOSE SUITS WERE SETTLED IN A PHONE INTERVIEW  MR  SMITH  WHO IS ALSO MICROSOFTS CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER  CALLED ITS LEGAL PROBLEMS IN PAST DECADES A GUT WRENCHING EXPERIENCE THAT HAD SHAPED MICROSOFT IN ITS CURRENT FORM  IT MADE MICROSOFT A BETTER AND MORE RESPONSIBLE COMPANY  HE SAID THIS YEAR  MICROSOFT PUBLISHED A BOOK THAT OUTLINED SOME OF THE HARMFUL EFFECTS THAT COULD COME FROM ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  SUCH AS BIAS IN JOB RECRUITING  IT HAS LITIGATED FOUR LAWSUITS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS IN EFFORTS TO DEFEND CUSTOMERS PRIVACY RIGHTS  ONE OF THEM  A FIGHT OVER LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCESS TO DATA STORED IN AN OVERSEAS MICROSOFT DATA CENTER  WENT TO THE SUPREME COURT  WHICH DROPPED THE CASE AFTER CONGRESS ENACTED A LAW THAT MOOTED IT NOT ONLY DID MICROSOFT LEARN FROM ITS MISTAKES  SATYA IS A UNIQUE AND CARING INDIVIDUAL  SAID TIM OREILLY  A TECH INDUSTRY PUBLISHER AND CONFERENCE ORGANIZER  HE UNDERSTANDS DEEPLY THAT MICROSOFT MUST HELP OTHERS TO SUCCEED THE CLOSEST ANALOG AMONG MR  NADELLAS PEERS IS TIM D  COOK  THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF APPLE  WHO HAS PAINTED APPLE AS A STAUNCH DEFENDER OF ITS CUSTOMERS PRIVACY  HE HAS JABBED AT FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE  BOTH ADVERTISING SUPPORTED BUSINESSES THAT PROFIT FROM THE PERSONAL DATA THEY COLLECT FROM THEIR USERS  A CONTRAST TO APPLES BUSINESS MODEL OF SELLING DEVICES FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE  WHICH OWNS YOUTUBE  HAVE DEFENDED THEIR ADVERTISING BUSINESSES FOR ALLOWING THEM TO DELIVER SERVICES FOR FREE  THEYVE PROMISED TO ADD MORE HUMAN MODERATORS AND INVEST IN SOFTWARE TOOLS THAT CAN SCREEN OUT MISINFORMATION AND OTHER PROHIBITED CONTENT MR  COOK HAS NOT TURNED HIS IRE TOWARD MICROSOFT  WHICH GETS MOST OF ITS REVENUE FROM SOFTWARE  HARDWARE AND CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICES  THE COMPANY HAS INVESTMENTS IN INTERNET SERVICES THAT ARE SUPPORTED IN PART BY ADVERTISING  INCLUDING ITS BING SEARCH ENGINE AND LINKEDIN  THE SOCIAL NETWORK FOR PROFESSIONALS IT ACQUIRED IN 2016 MR  NADELLA HAS BEEN MORE HESITANT THAN MR  COOK TO PUBLICLY CRITICIZE OTHER TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES  TURNING TO MORE SUBTLE TYPES OF PERSUASION  A LOW KEY LEADER  MR  NADELLA PEPPERS HIS SPEECHES AND INTERVIEWS WITH REFERENCES TO LITERATURE  WARNING THAT CARELESS CREATORS OF TECHNOLOGY COULD CONTRIBUTE TO A DYSTOPIAN WORLD OF GEORGE ORWELLS 1984 OR ALDOUS HUXLEYS BRAVE NEW WORLD  HIS LIEUTENANT  MR  SMITH  HAS BECOME A UBIQUITOUS AMBASSADOR FOR MICROSOFT ON THE BIG SOCIAL ISSUES FACING TECHNOLOGY IN WASHINGTON  IN BRUSSELS AND ON THE CONFERENCE CIRCUIT

20180503,politics,election,6,JUST LAST MONTH  PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HOW STORMY DANIELS RECEIVED  000 IN HUSH MONEY  HIS LAWYER  MICHAEL COHEN  HAS INSISTED FOR MONTHS THAT HE HAD KEPT MR  TRUMP COMPLETELY IN THE DARK AND THAT HE HAD HANDLED THE ENTIRE MATTER ON HIS OWN AS A PERSONAL FAVOR TO THE MAN FOR WHOM HE WOULD TAKE A BULLET ENTER RUDY GIULIANI  ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT  THE FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK AND MR  TRUMPS LATEST LEGAL FIXER WENT ON FOX NEWS  WHERE ELSE   TO OFFER A NEW VERSION OF THE STORMY DANIELS AFFAIR  THE PRESIDENT  MR  GIULIANI INSISTED  HAD IN FACT REIMBURSED MR  COHEN THE  000  EVEN THE SHOWS HOST  SEAN HANNITY  ANOTHER COHEN CLIENT  APPEARED STUNNED WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS GOING ON THE MOST GENEROUS READ OF WEDNESDAY NIGHTS SHOWPIECE IS THAT MR  GIULIANI AND MR  TRUMP HAVE MADE A CALCULATED DECISION THAT MR  COHEN FACES REAL LEGAL PERIL FOR HAVING GIVEN AN ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION IN THE FORM OF THE STORMY DANIELS PAYMENT  AND THAT MR  TRUMP MIGHT BE SUBJECT TO CO CONSPIRATOR LIABILITY  THE BEST DEFENSE AGAINST A COHEN CONVICTION  OR WORSE  A PLEA DEAL  ON THESE GROUNDS WOULD BE FOR MR  TRUMP TO TAKE CREDIT FOR THE PAYMENT  SINCE THE CANDIDATE CAN GIVE AS MUCH MONEY AS HE WANTS TO HIS OWN CAMPAIGN BUT WHATEVER THE PLAN  MR  GIULIANIS COMMENTS HAVE TURNED THE HEAT UP ON THE PRESIDENT JUDGING FROM MR  GIULIANIS CONTRIVED AND HAM HANDED DELIVERY  IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THIS WAS A HIGHLY COORDINATED AFFAIR  INDEED  ACCORDING TO ROBERT COSTA OF THE WASHINGTON POST  MR  GIULIANI SAID THE PRESIDENT WAS VERY PLEASED WITH HIS REMARKS IN THE MIDDLE OF A FRIENDLY CONVERSATION WITH MR  HANNITY  MR  GIULIANI INCONGRUOUSLY SHIFTED THE SUBJECT TO THE  000 PAYMENT TO STORMY DANIELS  WHICH  I MEAN  IS GOING TO TURN OUT TO BE PERFECTLY LEGAL  HE SAID  THAT MONEY WAS NOT CAMPAIGN MONEY  SORRY  IM GIVING YOU A FACT NOW THAT YOU DONT KNOW  ITS NOT CAMPAIGN MONEY  NO CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATION  THE FORMER MAYOR CONTINUED  THEY FUNNELED THROUGH A LAW FIRM  AND THE PRESIDENT REPAID IT HINT FOR POLITICAL FIXERS  AVOID USING THE WORD FUNNELED WHEN EXPLAINING WHY YOUR CLIENT DIDNT LAUNDER MONEY  IT TENDS TO SUGGEST THAT YOU ARE HIDING THE MONEYS TRUE SOURCE MR  GIULIANI FOLLOWED UP WITH A BOAST THAT DETRACTORS HAVE ALREADY PANNED AS CLASSIC RUDY  EVERYBODY WAS NERVOUS ABOUT THIS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING  I WASNT  I KNEW HOW MUCH MONEY DONALD TRUMP PUT INTO THAT CAMPAIGN  YET IN THE SAME BREATH  MR  GIULIANI ASSERTED THAT MR  TRUMP DIDNT KNOW ABOUT THE SPECIFICS OF IT  JUST THE GENERAL ARRANGEMENT  THAT MICHAEL WOULD TAKE CARE OF THINGS LIKE THIS HE THEN VEERED INTO THE PREPOSTEROUS  EXPLAINING THAT THE DANIELS PAYOUT WAS TOO INSIGNIFICANT TO BEAR MENTIONING  LIKE  I TAKE CARE OF THIS WITH MY CLIENTS  I DONT BURDEN THEM WITH EVERY SINGLE THING THAT COMES ALONG  THESE ARE BUSY PEOPLE THE BOTTOM LINE  ACCORDING TO MR  GIULIANI  MR  TRUMP KNEW ABOUT THE PAYMENT TO DANIELS AND REPAID MR  COHEN  HE NEEDS TO SELL THIS STORY SO THAT MR  COHENS PAYMENT WAS NOT A CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION  MORE ABOUT THAT BELOW  AND THAT MR  TRUMP DIDNT REALLY KNOW ABOUT THE ARRANGEMENT IN ADVANCE  AND SO HAS MINIMAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT IS TURNING OUT TO BE A COLOSSAL MESS WITH STORMY DANIELS THIS IS NOT A BIG  CLEAN TRUMPIAN LIE  IT IS MESSY AND CONVOLUTED AND FALLS APART WHEN YOU SPELL IT OUT  TRUMP DIDNT KNOW ABOUT THE SPECIFICS  BUT HE DID REPAY BECAUSE HE DID KNOW ABOUT THE GENERAL ARRANGEMENT  BUT HE DIDNT REALLY KNOW BECAUSE ITS JUST THE SORT OF THINGS LAWYERS DO FOR CLIENTS AND MR  COHEN DIDNT WANT TO BURDEN HIM SINCE HES A BUSY MAN  GOT THAT GOOD LUCK BEARING UP UNDER AN AGGRESSIVE CROSS EXAMINATION ON ALL THIS  IT MAY  IN FACT  COME TO THAT  BECAUSE AMONG THE MANY PROBLEMS WITH MR  GIULIANIS STORY IS THAT IT MAKES HIM A WITNESS TO IMPORTANT FACTS IN BOTH THE COHEN AND TRUMP INVESTIGATIONS IT ALSO  OF COURSE  INDICATES THAT MR  TRUMP WAS LYING WHEN HE SAID HE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE THAT MR  COHEN HAD PAID MS  DANIELS  PRESUMABLY THE CALCULATION OF TEAM TRUMP IS THAT HIS BASE EXACTS NO COST FOR EVEN THE BALDEST OF LIES  EVEN ONE OFFERED AS THE FINAL YOU CAN BELIEVE ME TRUTH AFTER MONTHS OF PREVARICATION MOREOVER  IF MR  GIULIANI BELIEVED THAT THIS LABORED ACCOUNT WOULD PUT MR  TRUMP AND THE CAMPAIGN IN THE CLEAR  HE WAS MOST LIKELY MISTAKEN  EVEN IF THE  000 PAYMENT WERE CONSTRUED AS A LOAN  IT WOULD STILL AMOUNT TO A CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION AND STILL NEED TO BE REPORTED  ITS TRUE THAT THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION HAS HISTORICALLY GONE LIGHTLY ON SUCH VIOLATIONS  BUT A KNOWING SCHEME TO VIOLATE ELECTION LAWS WOULD BE A CRIMINAL FELONY  AND ASSUMING THE CHARGE WOULD NOT FALL UNDER ROBERT MUELLERS JURISDICTION  THE PROSECUTORS IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK  WHERE MR  GIULIANI IS REMEMBERED AS A HEADLINE GRABBER  ARE AVAILABLE TO FILL THE BREACH ULTIMATELY  THERE SEEM TO BE TWO POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR MR  GIULIANIS PERFORMANCE ON FOX  THE FIRST IS HE WAS ACTING AS A FULLY AUTHORIZED AGENT FOR THE TRUMP CAMP  WHICH HAS MADE THE CALCULATION THAT SOME MIXTURE OF CONFUSION AND CONTRIVANCE IS THE PRESIDENTS BEST BET FOR MINIMIZING THE DAMAGE TO HIS PRESIDENCY FROM THE NETTLESOME DANIELS AFFAIR  THE SECOND IS THAT AS THE NEW LEGAL BOSS  HE HAD MR  TRUMPS GENERAL O K  AND WAS FREELANCING IN PART AND OFFERING THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF PARTIALLY BAKED SOLUTIONS GOING BACK TO MR  COHENS FIRST STORY EITHER WAY  AND IN KEEPING WITH THE TRADITION OF THIS WHITE HOUSE  TELLING THE TRUTH TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SEEMS TO HAVE PLAYED NO ROLE IN THE CALCULATIONS

20180506,business,economy,9,IS THE NATURAL RATE HYPOTHESIS DEAD  MAYBE  PROBABLY FROM THE MID 1970S UNTIL JUST THE OTHER DAY  THE OVERWHELMING VIEW IN MACROECONOMICS WAS THAT THERE IS NO LONG RUN TRADEOFF BETWEEN UNEMPLOYMENT AND INFLATION  THAT ANY ATTEMPT TO HOLD UNEMPLOYMENT BELOW SOME LEVEL DETERMINED BY STRUCTURAL FACTORS WOULD LEAD TO EVER ACCELERATING INFLATION  BUT THE DATA HAVENT SUPPORTED THAT VIEW FOR A WHILE  AND THE LATEST US EMPLOYMENT REPORT  WITH ITS COMBINATION OF A LOW REPORTED UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND CONTINUING WEAK WAGE GROWTH  SEEMS TO HAVE BROUGHT SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE NATURAL RATE TO CRITICAL MASS BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO QUESTION OR REJECT THE CONCEPT OF A NATURAL RATE  READING MIKE KONCZALS EXPLANATION FOR THE LAYPERSON  OR OLIVIER BLANCHARDS EXPOSITION FOR THE PROS  I WONDER WHETHER THE POINT IS COMING ACROSS CLEARLY ENOUGH  THATS NOT TO SAY THAT THERES ANYTHING WRONG WITH EITHER KONCZAL OR BLANCHARD  I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH WHAT BOTH ARE SAYING  EXCEPT THAT I WOULD TAKE A STRONGER STAND THAN OLIVIER AGAINST THE OLD ORTHODOXY  WHICH PROBABLY SAYS MORE ABOUT OUR PERSONALITIES THAN ABOUT OUR TAKE ON THE EVIDENCE  WHICH APPEARS TO BE IDENTICAL  BUT I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO RESTATE THE CASE AND THE IMPLICATIONS THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS THAT THE CASE FOR AGGRESSIVE MONETARY AND  WHEN NECESSARY  FISCAL POLICIES TO SUSTAIN DEMAND IS MUCH STRONGER THAN WE USED TO THINK  ERRORS LIKE THE TURN TO AUSTERITY AND THE ECBS 2011 RATE HIKE WERE MUCH BIGGER MISTAKES THAN THE PREVIOUS DOCTRINE ALLOWED FOR  PREMATURE FED RATE HIKES WOULD BE A BIGGER SIN THAN EVEN THE FED SEEMS TO REALIZE NOW  FOR GIVEN WHAT WE NOW SEEM TO KNOW  OUTPUT LOST TO WEAK DEMAND IS LOST FOREVER  THERE IS NO CHANCE TO MAKE UP FOR IT LATER DURING THE 1970S ALMOST THE WHOLE MACROECONOMICS PROFESSION WAS PERSUADED BY THE EXPERIENCE OF STAGFLATION THAT MILTON FRIEDMAN  AND EDMUND PHELPS  WERE RIGHT  THERE IS NO LONG RUN TRADEOFF BETWEEN INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT  CURRENT INFLATION DOES DEPEND ON UNEMPLOYMENT  BUT IT ALSO DEPENDS ONE FOR ONE ON EXPECTED INFLATION INFLATION   F U    EXPECTED INFLATIONWHERE F U  MEANS SOME FUNCTION OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE  MEANWHILE  EXPECTED INFLATION PRESUMABLY REFLECTS PAST INFLATION  SO TRYING TO KEEP U VERY LOW MEANS RAISING INFLATION EVER HIGHER TO KEEP AHEAD OF EXPECTATIONS  WHICH IS NOT A SUSTAINABLE STRATEGY ACTUALLY  THE SPEED WITH WHICH THE PROFESSION ADOPTED THE NATURAL RATE HYPOTHESIS WAS REMARKABLE  AND IS ESPECIALLY EXTRAORDINARY COMPARED WITH THE UTTER UNWILLINGNESS OF MANY MACROECONOMISTS TO ADMIT THAT EXPERIENCE SINCE 2008 REQUIRES SOME CHANGE IN THEIR MODELS  MAYBE EVEN A CONCESSION THAT KEYNESIANS WERE ONTO SOMETHING  BUT THATS A STORY FOR ANOTHER TIME SO WHAT HAPPENED  CONSIDER THE BEHAVIOR OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND CORE INFLATION SINCE 1980 THE FIRST HALF OF THE 80S WAS MARKED BY A HUGE RISE IN UNEMPLOYMENT  WHICH EVENTUALLY CAME BACK DOWN TO ROUGHLY ITS ORIGINAL LEVEL  BUT INFLATION AT THE END OF THIS CYCLE WAS A LOT LOWER THAN AT THE BEGINNING  SEEMING TO CONFIRM THE ACCELERATIONIST HYPOTHESIS BUT AFTER 2008 WE ONCE AGAIN HAD A HUGE RISE IN UNEMPLOYMENT  WHICH EVENTUALLY CAME BACK DOWN TO ROUGHLY ITS STARTING POINT  ACTUALLY LOWER AT THIS POINT  IF THIS CYCLE HAD PRODUCED AN 80S LEVEL DISINFLATION  WED BE WELL INTO DEFLATION BY NOW  INSTEAD  INFLATION IS ALSO PRETTY MUCH BACK WHERE WE STARTED DOES THIS MEAN THAT THERES NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN UNEMPLOYMENT AND INFLATION  DES ECONOMICS  DOWNWARD NOMINAL WAGE RIGIDITY IS A REAL THING  WHICH BECOMES HIGHLY RELEVANT AT LOW INFLATION  AND AS BLANCHARD SUGGESTS  IN A LOW INFLATION WORLD PEOPLE MAY SIMPLY STOP PAYING ATTENTION TO OVERALL INFLATION  OR BUILDING CHANGING EXPECTATIONS INTO THEIR PRICE SETTING SO WHY DOES THIS MATTER  CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING STORY  ANY RESEMBLANCE TO REAL EVENTS IS ENTIRELY INTENTIONAL  IMAGINE THAT WE GO THROUGH A SEVERE ECONOMIC SLUMP THAT TEMPORARILY DRIVES UNEMPLOYMENT WAY UP AND REDUCES INFLATION  BUT THAT EVENTUALLY INFLATION GETS BACK TO WHERE IT STARTED ON THE ACCELERATIONIST VIEW  THE PERIOD OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT SHOULD LEAD TO LOWER EXPECTED INFLATION  SO TO GET INFLATION BACK UP TO ITS ORIGINAL LEVEL POLICYMAKERS HAVE TO LET THE ECONOMY RUN HOT FOR A WHILE  WITH UNEMPLOYMENT BELOW ITS LONG RUN SUSTAINABLE LEVEL  ASSUMING THEY MANAGE TO DO THIS  THE PERIOD OF RUNNING HOT HELPS OFFSET THE COST OF THE INITIAL SLUMP  INDEED  TO A FIRST APPROXIMATION THE AVERAGE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OVER  SAY  A DECADE IS THE SAME AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WITHOUT THE SLUMP ON THIS VIEW  THE TASK OF CENTRAL BANKS AND FISCAL AUTHORITIES ISNT FULL EMPLOYMENT  ITS STABILIZATION  AVOIDING BIG SWINGS IN UNEMPLOYMENT  YOU CAN THINK OF REASONS THAT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT  BUT IT WOULD BE WRONG TO SIMPLY ADD UP THE OUTPUT LOST DURING A SLUMP AND CALL THAT THE LOSS TO THE ECONOMY BUT THE PALEO VIEW  WHICH IS THE ONE SUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE  SAYS THAT GETTING INFLATION BACK TO THE ORIGINAL LEVEL DOESNT MEAN RUNNING THE ECONOMY TEMPORARILY HOT  IT JUST MEANS GETTING UNEMPLOYMENT BACK DOWN  SO THERE IS NEVER ANY COMPENSATION FOR THE INITIAL SLUMP ON THAT VIEW  THE FAILURE TO SUPPLY ENOUGH DEMAND AFTER 2008 IMPOSED AN ENORMOUS COST  WHICH WE CAN NEVER REGAIN  AND LOOKING FORWARD  THE RISKS OF BEING TOO LOOSE VERSUS TOO TIGHT ARE HUGELY ASYMMETRIC  LETTING THE ECONOMY SLUMP AGAIN WILL AGAIN IMPOSE BIG COSTS THAT ARE NEVER MADE UP  WHILE RUNNING IT HOT WONT STORE UP ANY MEANINGFUL TROUBLE FOR THE FUTURE IS THIS REALITY BEING REFLECTED IN POLICY  MY SENSE IS THAT A LOT OF ECONOMISTS IN CENTRAL BANKS HAVE COME AROUND TO A NEO PALEO VIEW OF INFLATION  BUT ACTUAL POLICY STILL LOOKS AS IF ITS BEING RUN WITH AN ACCELERATIONIST PHILLIPS CURVE IN THE BACKGROUND  AT BEST  INDEED  THERES AN OBVIOUS UNWILLINGNESS EVEN TO TEMPORARILY LET THE ECONOMY RUN HOT THIS MATTERS  WE SHOULD NOT LET POLICY BE DRIVEN BY IDEAS THAT HAVENT WORKED FOR DECADES

SUZUKI  AND ALMOST 4 000 HAVE FOLLOWED  FEW HAVE EVER MADE AS MUCH IMPACT ON THURSDAY MORNING  BOTH WERE STILL PLAYING  PUJOLS THE ACTIVE LEADER IN HOME RUNS  SUZUKI THE ACTIVE LEADER IN HITS  BY MIDAFTERNOON  THOUGH  AS PUJOLS PREPARED TO CHASE HIS 3 000TH CAREER HIT WITH THE ANGELS IN ANAHEIM  CALIF  SUZUKI WAS NOT AN ACTIVE PLAYER ANYMORE IN A CAREFULLY DRAFTED NEWS RELEASE THAT DID NOT MENTION THE WORD RETIREMENT  THE MARINERS ANNOUNCED THAT SUZUKI WAS TRANSITIONING TO THE ROLE OF SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE CHAIRMAN  THURSDAYS AGREEMENT COVERS ONLY THIS SEASON  BUT THE MARINERS SAID IT WOULD PRECLUDE HIM FROM RETURNING TO THE ACTIVE ROSTER IN 2018  THE MARINERS OPEN NEXT SEASON IN JAPAN  WHICH WOULD BE A STORYBOOK SETTING FOR SUZUKI TO MAKE A COMEBACK OR PLAY ONE LAST TIME SUZUKI  WHO TURNS 45 IN OCTOBER  WAS THE SECOND OLDEST PLAYER IN THE MAJORS AFTER BARTOLO COLON  THE TEXAS RANGERS PITCHER WHO TURNS 45 THIS MONTH  SUZUKI WAS HITTING  205  9 FOR 44  WITH NO EXTRA BASE HITS THIS SEASON  AFTER RE SIGNING WITH SEATTLE IN MARCH AFTER FIVE AND A HALF SEASONS WITH THE YANKEES AND THE MIAMI MARLINS THE MARINERS SAID SUZUKI WOULD CONTINUE TO BE AROUND THE TEAM AT HOME AND ON THE ROAD  SERVING AS A MENTOR FOR TEAMMATES AND HELPING WITH HITTING  BASE RUNNING AND OUTFIELD DEFENSE WE REALLY DONT WANT HIM TO CHANGE ANYTHING THAT HES DOING RIGHT NOW  GENERAL MANAGER JERRY DIPOTO SAID IN A STATEMENT  WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT HE WILL NOT BE PLAYING IN GAMES SUZUKI HAS COLLECTED 3 089 HITS IN THE MAJORS  FOR A  311 AVERAGE  AFTER COMPILING 1 278 HITS FOR THE ORIX BLUE WAVE IN JAPAN FROM 1992 THROUGH 2000  HIS DEBUT FOR SEATTLE WAS A ROUSING SUCCESS  HE WON HIS LEAGUES ROOKIE OF THE YEAR AWARD  AS PUJOLS DID  AND WAS ALSO NAMED MOST VALUABLE PLAYER PUJOLS HAS BEEN AN M V P  TOO  WINNING FOR ST  LOUIS IN 2005  2008 AND 2009  BOTH PLAYERS HAVE MADE 10 ALL STAR TEAMS AND WON MULTIPLE GOLD GLOVES AND SILVER SLUGGER AWARDS  SUZUKI HAS TWO BATTING TITLES  PUJOLS ONE  NEITHER HAS EVER STRUCK OUT MORE THAN 93 TIMES IN A SEASON  THEY ARE PART OF THE LAST GENERATION OF HITTERS WHO DESPISED STRIKING OUT  BEFORE IT BECAME RELATIVELY ACCEPTABLE LETS SAY ITS 0 2 AND YOU GET A FASTBALL AND A GUY TAKES A HUGE HACK  IM NOT LIKE THAT  SUZUKI SAID LAST SPRING  THROUGH AN INTERPRETER  IM LOOKING TO GET THE BALL IN PLAY  THATS JUST THE WAY I AM  THE STYLE THAT I HAVE BECOME  SOME GUYS MAY NOT BE LIKE THAT  BUT YOUVE GOT TO THINK  WHAT IS THE PITCHER GOING TO DO TO ME HERE  YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR HEAD SUZUKI HAS ALWAYS DONE THAT  WITH A DEEP APPRECIATION FOR THE HISTORY OF HIS CRAFT  THE NATIONAL BASEBALL HALL OF FAME IN COOPERSTOWN  N Y  ENCHANTS HIM  HE HAS BEEN SEVEN TIMES  AND HE HAS VISITED THE GRAVES OF THE HALL OF FAMERS GEORGE SISLER  IN ST  LOUIS  AND WEE WILLIE KEELER  IN QUEENS  SUZUKI BROKE SISLERS SINGLE SEASON HITS RECORD IN 2004  WITH 262  AND BROKE KEELERS RECORD OF CONSECUTIVE SEASONS WITH 200 HITS  KEELER HAD A SEVEN YEAR STREAK FROM 1894 THROUGH 1901  A CENTURY BEFORE SUZUKI STARTED A 10 YEAR RUN INEVITABLY  THE PACE SLOWED  AND NOW IT HAS HALTED  FOR THE REST OF THIS SEASON  ANYWAY  NOBODY PLAYS FOREVER  EVEN THE MAJORS CAREER HITS LEADER  PETE ROSE  STRUCK OUT IN HIS FINAL AT BAT  AT AGE 45  AGAINST SAN DIEGOS GOOSE GOSSAGE IN 1986  SUZUKIS LAST AT BAT THIS SEASON WAS A STRIKEOUT AGAINST OAKLANDS BLAKE TREINEN ON WEDNESDAY FEW COULD HAVE KNOWN  AT THAT MOMENT  THAT SUZUKI MIGHT NEVER HIT AGAIN  BUT AS PUJOLS EXPLAINED IN AN INTERVIEW LAST SPRING  PLAYERS NEVER REALLY LEAVE ON THEIR OWN TERMS YOU DONT RETIRE  THE GAME RETIRES YOU  PUJOLS SAID  YOU DONT CHOOSE TO RETIRE  THE GAME LETS YOU KNOW WHEN ITS TIME FOR YOU TO WALK OUT  AND THATS HOW I LOOK AT IT  THE DAY THAT I FEEL I CANT COMPETE ANYMORE  IT DOESNT MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY IVE GOT LEFT ON MY CONTRACT  THATS NOT THE PERSONALITY THAT I CARRY  THATS NOT WHO I AM  I THINK ITS TIME TO WALK OUT PUJOLS  38  HAS NOT REACHED THAT POINT  HE ENTERED THURSDAYS GAME HITTING  248 WITH A CAREER LOW  266 ON BASE PERCENTAGE  BUT HE ALSO HAD SIX HOME RUNS AND 15 RUNS BATTED IN  BOOSTING HIS CAREER TOTALS TO 620  SEVENTH ON THE CAREER LIST  AND 1 933  NINTH HES ONE OF THOSE GUYS THAT EVERY GENERATION  AS THE GAME GOES ON  THOSE PLAYERS  NO MATTER WHEN THEY PLAYED  WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST FINE  THE ANGELS CHRIS YOUNG TOLD MY COLLEAGUE BILLY WITZ LAST WEEK  ALBERT PUJOLS HAS BEEN PLAYING 20 YEARS  AND THE GAME IS DIFFERENT  BUT HES STILL PLAYING GREAT THAT IS DEBATABLE  CONSIDERING PUJOLS OFFERS LITTLE VALUE ANYMORE ON DEFENSE OR ON THE BASES  AND NO LONGER SEEMS FEARED BY PITCHERS  WHO HAVE WALKED HIM ONLY THREE TIMES THIS SEASON  HIS PURSUIT OF 3 000 HITS WOULD PROBABLY COMMAND MORE ATTENTION HAD HE STAYED IN ST  LOUIS  BUT HE LEFT IN DECEMBER 2011  WHEN THE ANGELS OVERWHELMED HIM WITH A 10 YEAR   MILLION CONTRACT THAT RUNS THROUGH 2021 THE ANGELS HAVE NOT WON A PLAYOFF GAME WITH PUJOLS  BUT WITH MIKE TROUT IN HIS PRIME AND SHOHEI OHTANI SHOWING EXTRAORDINARY PROMISE AS A HITTER AND PITCHER  THEY HAVE HOPE  PUJOLS HAS ALREADY WON TWO TITLES  AND WILL SOON BECOME THE FIRST PLAYER EVER WITH 3 000 HITS AND 600 HOMERS TO GO WITH MULTIPLE CHAMPIONSHIPS HIS LEGACY IS SECURE  BUT AS LONG AS HE KEEPS PLAYING  PUJOLS WILL KEEP CHANGING THE FINAL NUMBERS TO BE ENGRAVED ON HIS HALL OF FAME PLAQUE  SUZUKIS  ALAS  ARE FROZEN  AT LEAST FOR NOW

20180506,entertainment,music,3,SAN FRANCISCO  IN JULY 2014  A TEAM OF FOUR SWEDISH AND POLISH RESEARCHERS BEGAN USING AN AUTOMATED PROGRAM TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLE POSTED ON FACEBOOK THE PROGRAM  KNOWN AS A SCRAPER  LET THE RESEARCHERS LOG EVERY COMMENT AND INTERACTION FROM 160 PUBLIC FACEBOOK PAGES FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS  BY MAY 2016  THEY HAD AMASSED ENOUGH INFORMATION TO TRACK HOW 368 MILLION FACEBOOK MEMBERS BEHAVED ON THE SOCIAL NETWORK  IT IS ONE OF THE LARGEST KNOWN SETS OF USER DATA EVER ASSEMBLED FROM FACEBOOK WERE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW EASY IT WAS TO COLLECT THIS  SAID FREDRIK ERLANDSSON  ONE OF THE RESEARCHERS AND A LECTURER AT THE BLEKINGE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY IN SWEDEN  LAST DECEMBER  HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES PUBLISHED A RESEARCH PAPER IN THE JOURNAL ENTROPY DETAILING HOW THEIR METHODS OF TRAWLING SOCIAL MEDIA SITES COULD BE REPLICATED FOR MORE THAN A DECADE  PROFESSORS  DOCTORAL CANDIDATES AND RESEARCHERS FROM ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE HARVESTED INFORMATION FROM FACEBOOK USING TECHNIQUES SIMILAR TO THOSE OF DR  ERLANDSSON AND HIS TEAM  THEY HAVE COMPILED HUNDREDS OF FACEBOOK DATA SETS THAT CAPTURED THE BEHAVIOR OF A FEW THOUSAND TO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUALS  ACCORDING TO INTERVIEWS WITH MORE THAN A DOZEN SCHOLARS THEIR PRACTICES CAME TO LIGHT IN MARCH WHEN THE NEW YORK TIMES AND THE OBSERVER OF LONDON REPORTED THAT ALEKSANDR KOGAN  A UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSOR  HAD OBTAINED THE DATA OF UP TO 87 MILLION FACEBOOK USERS THROUGH A QUIZ APP  MR  KOGAN SOLD THE INFORMATION TO CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA  A POLITICAL CONSULTING FIRM WITH TIES TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN  SO IT COULD BUILD PSYCHOGRAPHIC PROFILES OF AMERICAN VOTERS  LAST WEEK  CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA SAID IT WOULD CEASE OPERATIONS AFTER THE UPROAR OVER ITS USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION BUT WHILE WHAT HAPPENED WITH MR  KOGANS FACEBOOK DATA SET IS NOW KNOWN  THE FATE OF OTHER INFORMATION HOARDS IS MURKIER  IN MANY CASES  THE DATA WAS USED FOR RESEARCH OR SCHOLARLY ARTICLES  THE INFORMATION WAS THEN SOMETIMES LEFT UNSECURED AND STORED ON OPEN SERVERS THAT OFFERED ACCESS TO ANYONE  SOME ACADEMICS SAID THE DATA COULD HAVE BEEN EASILY COPIED AND SOLD TO MARKETERS OR POLITICAL CONSULTING FIRMS THE POTENTIAL RESULT IS MORE LEAKAGE OF FACEBOOK USERS INFORMATION THROUGH ACADEMIC CIRCLES  SAID RASMUS KLEIS NIELSEN  A PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL COMMUNICATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD WHO HAS STUDIED DATA COLLECTION FROM FACEBOOK THE ACADEMIC WORLD IS HIGHLY DECENTRALIZED  AND EACH INDIVIDUAL  EACH INSTITUTION  HAS A DIFFERENT WAY OF SECURING THEIR DATA  DR  NIELSEN SAID  EVEN IF ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY IS CAREFUL AND PROTECTS THE DATA  YOU STILL CAN END UP IN A SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE IS CARELESS OR ACTS IN BAD FAITH AND SELLS ACCESS  ITS HARD TO IMAGINE HOW FACEBOOK STOPS THAT FROM HAPPENING THE TIMES REVIEWED HALF A DOZEN FACEBOOK DATA SETS COMPILED BY ACADEMICS FROM 2006 TO 2017  ONE  GATHERED FROM 2015 TO 2017 BY RESEARCHERS IN DENMARK AND NEW ZEALAND  EXAMINED 1 3 MILLION PEOPLE IN DENMARK  ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE COUNTRYS POPULATION  TO DETERMINE HOW LIKING ONE POLITICAL PAGE ON FACEBOOK COULD PREDICT HOW SOMEONE WOULD VOTE IN THE FUTURE  ANOTHER SET  FROM 2013  BY A GROUP OF NORWEGIAN ACADEMICS FOCUSED ON THE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT OF 21 MILLION FACEBOOK MEMBERS ON FOUR CONTINENTS THE DANISH RESEARCH TEAM DID NOT RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR COMMENT  PETTER BAE BRANDTZAEG  ONE OF THE NORWEGIAN RESEARCHERS  SAID HE UNDERSTOOD CONCERNS ABOUT DATA GATHERING AS A RESEARCHER YOU GET IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO PEOPLES BEHAVIOR  ATTITUDES  FEELINGS AND RELATIONSHIPS  WHICH ARE OF COURSE TEMPTING FOR ALL  HE WROTE IN AN EMAIL  HE SAID MANY RESEARCHERS LACKED THE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE TO PROPERLY SECURE DATA THE FACEBOOK DATA WAS TYPICALLY AMASSED THROUGH SCRAPER PROGRAMS THAT CRAWLED THE SOCIAL NETWORK TO DOCUMENT WHAT WAS POSTED  OR THROUGH QUIZ APPS THAT REQUESTED ACCESS TO PEOPLES PROFILES  THE RESULTS INCLUDED USERS LOCATIONS  INTERESTS  POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS  FACEBOOK INTERACTIONS AND EVEN MUSIC PREFERENCES IN MOST CASES  RESEARCHERS ASSIGNED NUMBERS TO PEOPLE WHOSE FACEBOOK INFORMATION THEY HAD OBTAINED TO MAINTAIN ANONYMITY  BUT THE MORE DATA THERE IS  THE EASIER IT IS TO OVERLAY ONE INFORMATION SET WITH ANOTHER TO IDENTIFY SOMEONE  ONE 2015 PAPER PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL SCIENCE LOOKED AT CREDIT CARD SPENDING DATA AND FOUND THAT DATA SCIENTISTS COULD PINPOINT 90 PERCENT OF THE SHOPPERS BY NAME WITH JUST FOUR RANDOM PIECES OF INFORMATION FROM SITES LIKE FACEBOOK  INSTAGRAM AND TWITTER ONCE PEOPLE ARE IDENTIFIED AND THEIR INTERESTS AND INTERACTIONS KNOWN  THEY CAN BE TARGETED WITH ADVERTISING AND MOBILIZED FOR POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS OR OTHER CAUSES FOR YEARS  FACEBOOK HAD NO SPECIFIC POLICIES ABOUT ACADEMICS ACCESS TO USER DATA  THOUGH IT HAD GUIDELINES ON WORKING WITH THIRD PARTIES  WHILE THE COMPANY HAS A RULE THAT FORBIDS THE USE OF SCRAPERS  IT HAS NOT ENFORCED THAT POLICY AGAINST SCHOLARS  AND AT TIMES  IT HAS ASSISTED RESEARCHERS WITH STUDIES IN 2014  THOUGH  FACEBOOK BEGAN LIMITING THIRD PARTY APPS  LIKE QUIZZES  FROM OBTAINING USERS INFORMATION SINCE MR  KOGANS ACTIONS WERE REVEALED  FUELING AN OUTCRY OVER DATA PRIVACY  FACEBOOK HAS MADE FURTHER CHANGES  THE COMPANY HAS GIVEN PEOPLE MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR PRIVACY SETTINGS  IT HAS SAID IT WILL AUDIT  ALL APPS THAT COLLECTED LARGE AMOUNTS OF FACEBOOK DATA  AND IT TEMPORARILY STOPPED ALLOWING NEW APPS TO GATHER INFORMATION FROM ITS MEMBERS LAST MONTH  FACEBOOK ALSO NARROWED THE NUMBER OF ACADEMICS IT WOULD WORK WITH  SAYING IT WOULD COLLABORATE WITH THOSE WHO WANTED TO RESEARCH THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA ON ELECTIONS THROUGH AN INDEPENDENT ELECTION RESEARCH COMMISSION  ONLY SCHOLARS WITH ELECTION RELATED PROJECTS CAN APPLY WE ARE TAKING A HARD LOOK AT THE INFORMATION APPS CAN USE WHEN YOU CONNECT THEM TO FACEBOOK  AS WELL AS OTHER DATA PRACTICES  SUSAN GLICK  A FACEBOOK SPOKESWOMAN  SAID IN A STATEMENT  THESE OTHER DATA PRACTICES INCLUDE ACADEMIC RESEARCH BEFORE SOCIAL MEDIA EXISTED  RESEARCHERS HOPING TO STUDY HUMAN BEHAVIOR HAD TO PAINSTAKINGLY SEEK OUT GROUPS OF PEOPLE TO EXAMINE  SOCIAL MEDIA HAS LET THEM EASILY FIND MASSES OF SUBJECTS  AS WELL AS INFORMATION LIKE THEIR DATE OF BIRTH  GENDER AND INTERESTS  AND OBSERVE SOME OF THEIR ONLINE BEHAVIOR IN REAL TIME IT WAS UNPRECEDENTED  SAID CHRISTIAN RUDDER  A FOUNDER OF OKCUPID  A DATING AND SOCIAL MEDIA SITE  WHO PUBLISHED THE BOOK DATACLYSM IN 2014 ON HOW MUCH PEOPLE REVEALED THROUGH THEIR ONLINE LIVES ONE OF THE ACADEMIC COMMUNITYS EARLIEST KNOWN FACEBOOK DATA SETS WAS COLLECTED IN 2006 BY HARVARD UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS  IT COVERED 1 700 PEOPLE WHO AGREED TO HAVE THEIR FACEBOOK INFORMATION ANONYMOUSLY ANALYZED  THE DATA WAS LATER EASILY TRACED BACK BY OTHER ACADEMICS TO HARVARD FRESHMEN IN BRITAIN  RESEARCHERS WERE DOING SIMILAR WORK THROUGH DIFFERENT MEANS  IN 2007  MICHAL KOSINSKI  THEN DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT THE PSYCHOMETRICS CENTER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE  WORKED WITH A COLLEAGUE  DAVID STILLWELL  TO CREATE MY PERSONALITY  A QUIZ APP THAT OFFERED TO ASSESS PEOPLES PERSONALITIES IN EXCHANGE FOR DATA ABOUT THEM  IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES A QUIZ APP HAD BEEN USED FOR OBTAINING FACEBOOK MEMBERS INFORMATION MY PERSONALITY HAS NOW COLLECTED DETAILS ON MORE THAN SIX MILLION FACEBOOK USERS  ACCORDING TO THE ACADEMICS WHO HAVE GATHERED THE DATA  MANY RESEARCHERS HAVE SINCE COPIED THE QUIZ APP METHOD  INCLUDING MR  KOGAN IN INTERVIEWS WITH THE TIMES  DR  KOSINSKI AND DR  STILLWELL SAID THEY TOOK GREAT CARE TO KEEP THE DATA THEY PROCURED ANONYMOUS  DR  STILLWELL ADDED THAT THE INFORMATION HAD BEEN WIDELY SHARED WITH OTHER RESEARCHERS  BUT ANY ACADEMIC WHO WISHED TO USE IT WAS VETTED DR  KOSINSKI ACKNOWLEDGED THAT DATA IS NOT A PHYSICAL ITEM THAT IS EASY TO CONTROL  ONCE A DATA SET IS CREATED  IT CAN BE COPIED AND SHARED UNTIL ITS ORIGINAL SOURCE IS UNKNOWN  HE SAID COLLECTION OF INFORMATION FROM FACEBOOK HAD BECOME WIDESPREAD OVER THE YEARS  NOT ONLY BY ACADEMICS BUT ALSO BY DEVELOPERS  MARKETERS  DATA ANALYTICS COMPANIES AND OTHERS WHAT KOGAN DID WAS WRONG  BUT WHAT KOGAN DID  MANY OTHERS DO ON A MUCH LARGER SCALE  DR  KOSINSKI SAID  THEY JUST DONT GET CAUGHT IN 2014  AFTER FACEBOOK ANNOUNCED IT WOULD RESTRICT THIRD PARTY APPS FROM GAINING ACCESS TO USER DATA  THE REACH OF QUIZ APPS BECAME LIMITED  BUT SCRAPERS CONTINUED TO IMPROVE AND MORE SPEEDILY COMPILE INFORMATION FROM THE SOCIAL NETWORK A GROUP OF GERMAN ACADEMICS USED A SCRAPER TO HARVEST THE PROFILES OF 60 000 FACEBOOK USERS IN THE NEW ORLEANS AREA STARTING IN LATE 2008  THE RESEARCHERS  WHOSE GOAL WAS TO STUDY HOW PEOPLES FRIENDSHIPS CHANGE ONLINE OVER TIME  RECORDED OVER 800 000 INTERACTIONS DURING A TWO YEAR PERIOD  THEY DID NOT RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR COMMENT SOME SCHOLARS SAID FACEBOOKS RECENT PRIVACY CHANGES MAY HAVE GONE TOO FAR BY ALSO CUTTING OFF ACADEMICS WHO BEHAVED RESPONSIBLY ACADEMICS WOULD ARGUE THAT WE NEED ACCESS TO PRIMARY DATA  SAID DR  NIELSEN OF OXFORD  HE SAID THE CHANGES MIGHT LEAD TO AN ASYMMETRY  WITH INTERNAL FACEBOOK RESEARCHERS ACCUMULATING MOUNDS OF DATA WHILE OUTSIDE ACADEMICS WOULD NOT IF THAT HAPPENS  ONLY FACEBOOK WILL REALLY KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT HOW FACEBOOK ACTUALLY OPERATES AND HOW PEOPLE ACT ON FACEBOOK  HE SAID DR  ERLANDSSON SAID THE PAPER HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES PUBLISHED LAST DECEMBER INITIALLY MADE LITTLE SPLASH  BUT SINCE THE CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA REVELATIONS  HE HAS SEEN RENEWED INTEREST  HE SAID HE HAD BEEN CONTACTED BY COMPANIES  HE DECLINED TO NAME THEM  INTERESTED IN BUYING THE DATA ON 368 MILLION FACEBOOK MEMBERS IM NOT INTERESTED IN SELLING  HE SAID  AND THE TRUTH IS  ANYONE COULD EASILY DO THIS THEMSELVES

20180505,politics,north korea,8,WASHINGTON  U S  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP S NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JOHN BOLTON AND HIS SOUTH KOREAN COUNTERPART  CHUNG EUI YONG  REAFFIRMED ON FRIDAY THAT THERE WERE NO PLANS TO CHANGE THE TWO COUNTRIES   BILATERAL DEFENSE POSTURE  IN SOUTH KOREA  THE WHITE HOUSE SAID IN A STATEMENT THE TWO OFFICIALS  WHO MET IN WASHINGTON  ALSO DISCUSSED TRUMP S PLANNED MEETING WITH NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG UN AND BEGAN PREPARATIONS FOR A VISIT BY SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON JAE IN TO THE WHITE HOUSE ON MAY 22  THE STATEMENT SAID   REPORTING BY MOHAMMAD ZARGHAM  EDITING BY ERIC WALSH
20180501,politics,election,1,WASHINGTON  JUSTICE ANTHONY KENNEDY HAS HIS LAW CLERKS LINED UP FOR NEXT YEAR  HE PLANS TO TEACH IN SALZBURG  AUSTRIA  IN JULY  AS HE HAS DONE ALMOST EVERY SUMMER FOR MORE THAN TWO DECADES  IN SHORT  THERE ARE NO OUTWARD SIGNS THAT THE 81 YEAR OLD JUSTICE IS IN HIS FINAL MONTHS ON THE SUPREME COURT SO WHY ARE LIBERALS IN A STATE OF HEIGHTENED ANXIETY THAT KENNEDY MIGHT LEAVE  AND WHY ARE SOME CONSERVATIVES HOPEFUL THAT  APPEARANCES ASIDE  KENNEDY COULD STEP DOWN AFTER MORE THAN 30 YEARS ON THE HIGH COURT BECAUSE IF HE GOES  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP GETS TO NOMINATE HIS SUCCESSOR  WHOM A SLIM REPUBLICAN SENATE MAJORITY IS LIKELY TO CONFIRM  THE REPLACEMENT JUSTICE WOULD BE MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN KENNEDY AND THE RIGHT WOULD HAVE A SOLID WORKING MAJORITY OF THE NINE JUSTICES THE SPECULATION REFLECTS THE DARKEST FEARS AND FONDEST WISHES OF PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THE COURT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM  AS THE JUSTICE CLOSEST TO THE MIDDLE ON AN OTHERWISE STARKLY DIVIDED COURT  KENNEDY CONTROLS THE OUTCOME OF A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF BIG TICKET CASES THAT DIVIDE ALLOWS KENNEDY TO DECIDE HOW FAR TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT THE COURT MOVES ON A RANGE OF ISSUES  INCLUDING ABORTION  GUN RIGHTS  CAPITAL PUNISHMENT  AFFIRMATIVE ACTION  AND VOTING RIGHTS FILLING THE VACANCY COULD BE AS CONTENTIOUS AS IT WAS WHEN JUSTICE LEWIS POWELL  KENNEDY S PREDECESSOR  RETIRED IN 1987 AND PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN SETTLED ON KENNEDY ONLY AFTER HIS FIRST TWO CHOICES FOR THE SEAT FAILED  SAID DAVID YALOF  CHAIRMAN OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT IN 1987 YOU HAD A DEMOCRATIC SENATE FACE OFF AGAINST A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT IN HIS FINAL TWO YEARS IN OFFICE  HERE  YOU HAVE A REPUBLICAN SENATE AND A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT IN HIS FIRST TWO YEARS IN OFFICE  YALOF SAID THE CONCERN AMONG LIBERALS IS PALPABLE  KENNEDY IS NEARLY 82 AND THE AVERAGE RETIREMENT AGE OF THE LAST 15 JUSTICES WHO RETIRED IS JUST OVER 77 YEARS  THAT INCLUDES JOHN PAUL STEVENS  WHO WAS 90 WHEN HE RETIRED IN 2010 AND 58 YEAR OLD ABE FORTAS  WHO LEFT THE COURT AMID REVELATIONS OF FINANCIAL IMPROPRIETIES IN 1969 IF KENNEDY WERE TO ANNOUNCE HIS RETIREMENT THIS SPRING  IT WOULD INJECT THE COURT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE MIDTERM CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS AND PUT HIS  CRITICAL FIFTH VOTE IN THE HANDS OF PERHAPS THE LEAST COMPETENT PRESIDENT IN MODERN HISTORY TO MANAGE AND VALUE IT  SAID ELIZABETH WYDRA  PRESIDENT OF THE LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY CENTER THE NEW YORK TIMES EDITORIAL BOARD PENNED AN OPEN LETTER TO KENNEDY ON SUNDAY  IMPLORING HIM TO HANG ON   HOW CAN WE PUT THIS THE RIGHT WAY  PLEASE DON T GO  IT SAID THE TWO OLDER JUSTICES  RUTH BADER GINSBURG  85  AND STEPHEN BREYER  79  ARE DEMOCRATIC APPOINTEES WHO ARE UNLIKELY TO GO ANYWHERE DURING A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IF THEY CAN HELP IT THE PLEAS FOR KENNEDY TO STAY COME IN A TERM WHEN HE COULD SIDE WITH CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES TO ERODE THE POWER OF LABOR UNIONS FOR GOVERNMENT WORKERS  GIVE THE UPPER HAND TO EMPLOYERS WHO WANT TO PREVENT WORKERS FROM BANDING TOGETHER TO COMPLAIN ABOUT PAY AND WORKPLACE CONDITIONS  SIDE WITH TEXAS IN A DISPUTE OVER ELECTORAL DISTRICTS THAT WERE STRUCK DOWN BY A LOWER COURT FOR BEING DISCRIMINATING AGAINST BLACK AND HISPANIC VOTERS  LIMIT STATE EFFORTS TO REGULATE ANTI ABORTION PREGNANCY CENTERS AND UPHOLD TRUMP S BAN ON TRAVEL FROM SEVERAL MAJORITY MUSLIM COUNTRIES KENNEDY S VOTE ALSO IS LIKELY TO BE DECISIVE IN TWO OTHER HIGH PROFILE ISSUES  A COLORADO BAKER S OBJECTION TO CREATING A WEDDING CAKE FOR A SAME SEX COUPLE AND EFFORTS TO REIN IN THE DRAWING OF ELECTORAL DISTRICTS FOR PARTISAN GAIN A RETIREMENT ANNOUNCEMENT COULD COME AT ANY TIME  AND PERHAPS SOONER RATHER THAN LATER IF KENNEDY IS INTERESTED IN THE RELATIVELY QUICK AND SMOOTH CONFIRMATION OF THE NEXT JUSTICE  STEVENS AND JUSTICE DAVID SOUTER  THE LAST TWO RETIREES  REVEALED THEIR INTENTIONS IN APRIL 2010 AND MAY 2009  RESPECTIVELY  THAT ENABLED PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA TO ANNOUNCE HIS CHOICES IN TIME FOR FINAL SENATE ACTION BY EARLY AUGUST BY CONTRAST  IN 1987  POWELL WAITED UNTIL LATE JUNE TO SAY HE WAS RETIRING  WHEN THE SENATE VOTED DOWN ROBERT BORK  REAGAN S FIRST CHOICE  AND DOUGLAS GINSBURG WITHDREW AS REAGAN S SECOND PICK  THE COURT BEGAN ITS NEXT TERM WITH JUST EIGHT JUSTICES ON THE BENCH  KENNEDY  REAGAN S THIRD CHOICE  DID NOT JOIN THEM UNTIL FEBRUARY 1988 THE TIMING OF HIS ANNOUNCEMENT ALSO MIGHT INFLUENCE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF HIS RETIREMENT  THE SOONEST KENNEDY WOULD LEAVE IS AT THE END OF JUNE  AFTER ALL THE COURT S CURRENT CASES HAVE BEEN DECIDED  SOME JUSTICES STEP DOWN IMMEDIATELY  OTHERS STAY UNTIL THEIR SUCCESSOR IS CONFIRMED  SOMETIMES REFLECTING A WORRY THAT THE COURT MIGHT START ITS TERM SHORT STAFFED THOSE CONCERNS PROBABLY ARE NOT VERY SERIOUS AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE EVERY INCENTIVE AND FEW PROCEDURAL IMPEDIMENTS TO CONFIRMING A NEW JUSTICE   I THINK IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DEFEAT ANY TRUMP NOMINEE FOR THAT SEAT UNLESS OF COURSE THERE ARE CHARACTER ISSUES OR THAT SORT OF THING  SAID RICHARD ARENBERG  A LONGTIME DEMOCRATIC SENATE AIDE WHO NOW TEACHES POLITICAL SCIENCE AT BROWN UNIVERSITY THEY PROBABLY WOULD NOT WANT TO CHANCE WAITING FOR THE ELECTION RESULTS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING CONTROL OF THE SENATE  EVEN IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE  HOWEVER  SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL STILL COULD PUSH FOR A CONFIRMATION BETWEEN THE ELECTION AND THE START OF THE NEXT CONGRESS IN JANUARY  YALOF SAID BUT IF KENNEDY DECIDES TO SERVE ANOTHER A YEAR OR TWO AND DEMOCRATS WIN THE SENATE IN NOVEMBER  IT COULD BE CONSIDERABLY HARDER FOR TRUMP TO GET A NOMINEE CONFIRMED  ESPECIALLY SINCE MCCONNELL REFUSED TO ACT ON MERRICK GARLAND S NOMINATION IN THE LAST YEAR OF OBAMA S PRESIDENCY
20180502,politics,politics,1,REUTERS    U S  SOLAR AND WIND ENERGY COMPANIES HAVE DONATED FAR MORE MONEY TO REPUBLICANS THAN DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESSIONAL RACES THIS ELECTION CYCLE  ACCORDING TO A REUTERS ANALYSIS OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE DATA  AN UNPRECEDENTED TILT TO THE RIGHT FOR AN INDUSTRY LONG ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL LEFT WHILE THE MONEY IS MODEST COMPARED WITH THAT DONATED BY FOSSIL FUEL INTERESTS  THE SUPPORT PROVIDES GOP CANDIDATES WITH ADDED CREDIBILITY ON CLEAN ENERGY  AN ISSUE POLLING SHOWS SWING VOTERS CARE ABOUT  RENEWABLE ENERGY HAS TYPICALLY DEPENDED ON GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES AND POLICIES TO HELP FUEL ITS GROWTH  AND THE DONATIONS COME AT A TIME WHEN REPUBLICANS CONTROL BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS AS WELL AS A MAJORITY OF STATE HOUSES ACROSS THE COUNTRY  REPUBLICANS

THAN TO DEMOCRATS  REPUBLICANS RECEIVED JUST OVER HALF OF THE COMBINED  470 IN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM MAJOR WIND AND SOLAR PACS  BEFORE THAT  SOLAR AND WIND COMPANIES MAINLY DONATED TO DEMOCRATS  WHO WERE BROADLY SEEN AS MORE SUPPORTIVE OF POLICIES THAT COULD HELP THE NASCENT SECTOR GROW  IN 2014  70 PERCENT OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM SEVEN MAJOR WIND AND SOLAR PACS WENT TO DEMOCRATS  THE U S

20180503,politics,election,4,WASHINGTON  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP INSISTED THURSDAY HIS REIMBURSEMENT OF A 2016 HUSH PAYMENT TO PORN ACTRESS STORMY DANIELS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN  BUT THE SURPRISE REVELATION OF THE PRESIDENT S PAYMENT CLASHED WITH HIS PAST STATEMENTS  CREATED NEW LEGAL HEADACHES AND STUNNED MANY IN THE WEST WING WHITE HOUSE AIDES WERE BLINDSIDED WHEN TRUMP S RECENTLY ADDED ATTORNEY  RUDY GIULIANI  SAID WEDNESDAY NIGHT THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD REPAID MICHAEL COHEN FOR  000 THAT WAS GIVEN TO DANIELS TO KEEP HER QUIET BEFORE THE 2016 ELECTION ABOUT HER ALLEGATIONS OF AN AFFAIR WITH TRUMP  GIULIANI S REVELATION  WHICH SEEMED TO CONTRADICT TRUMP S PAST STATEMENTS  CAME AS THE PRESIDENT S NEWLY CONFIGURED OUTSIDE LEGAL TEAM PURSUED HIS DEFENSE  APPARENTLY WITH ZERO COORDINATION WITH THE WEST WING WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS SAID SHE FIRST LEARNED THAT TRUMP HAD REPAID THE HUSH MONEY FROM GIULIANI S INTERVIEW ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL S  HANNITY  STAFFERS  PHONES BEGAN TO BUZZ WITHIN MOMENTS  DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY HOGAN GIDLEY  WHO HAD PRE TAPED AN INTERVIEW WITH FOX NEWS EARLIER WEDNESDAY EVENING  WAS SUDDENLY SUMMONED TO RETURN FOR A LIVE INTERVIEW WHILE GIULIANI SAID THE PAYMENT TO DANIELS WAS  GOING TO TURN OUT TO BE PERFECTLY LEGAL  LEGAL EXPERTS SAID THE NEW INFORMATION RAISED A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS  INCLUDING WHETHER THE MONEY REPRESENTED REPAYMENT OF AN UNDISCLOSED LOAN OR COULD BE SEEN AS REIMBURSEMENT FOR A CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURE  EITHER COULD BE LEGALLY PROBLEMATIC GIULIANI INSISTED TRUMP DIDN T KNOW THE SPECIFICS OF COHEN S ARRANGEMENT WITH DANIELS UNTIL RECENTLY  TELLING  FOX   FRIENDS  ON THURSDAY THAT THE PRESIDENT DIDN T KNOW ALL THE DETAILS UNTIL  MAYBE 10 DAYS AGO  GIULIANI TOLD THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT TRUMP HAD REPAID COHEN  000 A MONTH  OUT OF HIS PERSONAL FAMILY ACCOUNT  AFTER THE CAMPAIGN WAS OVER  HE SAID COHEN RECEIVED  000 OR  000 IN ALL FOR EXPENSES RELATED TO TRUMP BUT NO DEBT TO COHEN WAS LISTED ON TRUMP S PERSONAL FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORM  WHICH WAS CERTIFIED ON JUNE 16  2017  ASKED IF TRUMP HAD FILED A FRAUDULENT FORM  SANDERS SAID   I DON T KNOW GIULIANI SAID THE PAYMENT WAS NOT A CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATION  BUT ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT DANIELS  HUSHED UP ALLEGATIONS COULD HAVE AFFECTED THE CAMPAIGN  SAYING   IMAGINE IF THAT CAME OUT ON OCTOBER 15  2016  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST DEBATE WITH HILLARY CLINTON QUESTIONS REMAIN ABOUT JUST WHAT TRUMP KNEW AND WHEN DANIELS  WHOSE LEGAL NAME IS STEPHANIE CLIFFORD  IS SEEKING TO BE RELEASED FROM A NON DISCLOSURE DEAL SHE SIGNED IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE 2016 ELECTION TO KEEP HER FROM TALKING ABOUT A 2006 SEXUAL ENCOUNTER SHE SAID SHE HAD WITH TRUMP  SHE HAS ALSO FILED DEFAMATION SUITS AGAINST COHEN AND TRUMP SPEAKING TO REPORTERS ON AIR FORCE ONE SEVERAL WEEKS AGO  TRUMP SAID HE DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE PAYMENT OR WHERE THE MONEY CAME FROM  IN A PHONE INTERVIEW WITH  FOX AND FRIENDS  LAST WEEK  HOWEVER  HE APPEARED TO MUDDY THE WATERS  SAYING THAT COHEN REPRESENTED HIM IN THE  CRAZY STORMY DANIELS DEAL SANDERS SAID THURSDAY THAT TRUMP  EVENTUALLY LEARNED  ABOUT THE PAYMENT  BUT SHE DID NOT OFFER DETAILS FOR ALL THE CONTROVERSY GIULIANI STIRRED UP  SOME TRUMP SUPPORTERS SAID IT WAS WISE TO GET THE PAYMENT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OUT IN THE OPEN SAID FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE   YOU KNOW  THERE S AN OLD SAYING IN THE LAW   HANG A LANTERN ON YOUR PROBLEMS     SO THE FACT IS THAT RUDY HAS TO GO OUT THERE NOW AND CLEAN IT UP  THAT S WHAT LAWYERS GET HIRED TO DO DANIELS HERSELF WEIGHED IN VIA TWITTER  SAYING   I DON T THINK COHEN IS QUALIFIED TO  CLEAN UP  MY HORSE S MANURE  TOO SOON HER ATTORNEY  MICHAEL AVENATTI  WHO ENGAGED IN HIS OWN PRESS TOUR THURSDAY  SLAMMED BOTH TRUMP AND GIULIANI THE ADMISSIONS BY MR  GIULIANI AS TO MR  TRUMP S CONDUCT AND THE ACTS OF MR  COHEN ARE DIRECTLY CONTRARY TO THE LIES PREVIOUSLY TOLD TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  HE SAID   THERE WILL ULTIMATELY BE SEVERE CONSEQUENCES TRUMP IS FACING MOUNTING LEGAL THREATS FROM THE COHEN DANIELS SITUATION AND THE SPECIAL COUNSEL S INVESTIGATION OF RUSSIAN MEDDLING IN THE ELECTION AND POSSIBLE COORDINATION WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN COHEN IS FACING A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION IN NEW YORK  AND FBI AGENTS RAIDED HIS HOME AND OFFICE SEVERAL WEEKS AGO SEEKING RECORDS ABOUT THE DANIELS NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT  GIULIANI HAS WARNED TRUMP THAT HE FEARS COHEN  THE PRESIDENT S LONGTIME PERSONAL ATTORNEY  WILL  FLIP  BENDING IN THE FACE OF A POTENTIAL PRISON SENTENCE  AND HE HAS URGED TRUMP TO CUT OFF COMMUNICATIONS WITH HIM  ACCORDING TO A PERSON CLOSE TO GIULIANI THE PRESIDENT S SELF PROCLAIMED LEGAL FIXER HAS BEEN SURPRISED AND CONCERNED BY TRUMP S RECENT STANCE TOWARD HIM  ACCORDING TO A COHEN CONFIDANT  COHEN WAS DISMAYED TO HEAR TRUMP MARGINALIZE HIS ROLE DURING AN INTERVIEW LAST WEEK WITH  FOX   FRIENDS  AND INTERPRETED A RECENT NEGATIVE NATIONAL ENQUIRER COVER STORY AS A WARNING SHOT FROM A PUBLICATION THAT HAS LONG BEEN COZY WITH TRUMP  SAID THE PERSON WHO WAS NOT AUTHORIZED TO TALK ABOUT PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS AND SPOKE ONLY ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY  COHEN ALSO HAD NOT INDICATED TO FRIENDS THAT TRUMP S LEGAL TEAM WAS GOING TO CONTRADICT HIS ORIGINAL CLAIM THAT HE WAS NOT REIMBURSED FOR THE PAYMENT TO DANIELS GIULIANI  A FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR AND U S  ATTORNEY  JOINED TRUMP S LEGAL TEAM LAST MONTH  HE TOLD CNN ON THURSDAY THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF TRUMP S REPAYMENT OF THE HUSH MONEY WAS A PLANNED STRATEGY  SAYING   YOU WON T SEE DAYLIGHT BETWEEN ME AND THE PRESIDENT  HE WAS QUICKLY BACKED UP BY TRUMP  WHO SAID ON TWITTER THAT HE HAD REPAID COHEN TRUMP HIMSELF WAS HAPPY WITH GIULIANI S PERFORMANCE  ACCORDING TO A PERSON FAMILIAR WITH HIS VIEWS BUT NOT AUTHORIZED TO SPEAK ABOUT THEM PUBLICLY  AND GIULIANI TOLD THE WASHINGTON POST THE PRESIDENT WAS  VERY PLEASED JASON MILLER  WHO WORKED ON BOTH TRUMP S AND GIULIANI S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS AND REMAINS CLOSE WITH BOTH  SAID THE FACT THE WHITE HOUSE WAS CAUGHT OFF GUARD WAS BY DESIGN  HE SAID THE OUTSIDE LEGAL TEAM WAS SUPPOSED TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY OF THE WHITE HOUSE  MODELED ON THE TEAM THAT DEFENDED PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON

ANOTHER BATCH OF HIS PICKS FOR INFLUENTIAL U S  APPEALS COURTS TO THE DISMAY OF SOME DEMOCRATS THE SENATE THIS WEEK IS SET TO TAKE UP SIX OF TRUMP S NOMINEES TO THE REGIONAL APPEALS COURTS  INCLUDING FOUR FROM STATES THAT HAVE AT LEAST ONE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR A LONG STANDING SENATE TRADITION THAT GAVE SENATORS CLOUT OVER JUDICIAL NOMINEES FROM THEIR HOME STATES HAS BEEN FRAYING FOR YEARS  MEANING DEMOCRATS HAVE LESS OF A CHANCE OF BLOCKING APPOINTEES THEY OPPOSE  AS THEY DID WITH SOME SUCCESS DURING REPUBLICAN FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W  BUSH S ADMINISTRATION ONE OF THOSE DUE FOR CONSIDERATION ON THE SENATE FLOOR THIS WEEK IS MILWAUKEE LAWYER MICHAEL BRENNAN  WHO TRUMP HAS NOMINATED FOR A VACANT SEAT ON THE CHICAGO BASED 7TH U S  CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS  WHICH HAS JURISDICTION OVER A

BARACK OBAMA WON CONFIRMATION OF NINE APPEALS COURT JUDGES BY THE SAME POINT IN HIS FIRST TERM TRUMP ALSO HAS BEEN PICKING A RAFT OF CONSERVATIVE JURISTS FOR LOWER FEDERAL COURTS AND WON SENATE CONFIRMATION LAST YEAR OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICE NEIL GORSUCH THE REGIONAL APPEALS COURTS PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN SHAPING U S  LAW  THE JUDGES HEAR APPEALS FROM FEDERAL DISTRICT COURTS AND USUALLY HAVE THE FINAL SAY  AS THE U S  SUPREME COURT TAKES UP ONLY A TINY PROPORTION OF CASES  THE APPEALS COURTS CAN SET BINDING PRECEDENTS ON A BROAD ARRAY OF ISSUES  INCLUDING VOTING RIGHTS  GUN RIGHTS AND OTHER DIVISIVE SOCIAL ISSUES WORTHWHILE PRICEFOR TRUMP AND HIS PARTY  SETTING ASIDE A LONG STANDING SENATE TRADITION MAY BE A WORTHWHILE PRICE TO PAY TO ACHIEVE WHAT SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL HAS CALLED A TOP GOAL  SHIFTING THE IDEOLOGICAL COMPOSITION OF THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY TO THE RIGHT FOR TRUMP  NINE OF THE 15 APPEALS COURT VACANCIES HE HAS FILLED HAVE BEEN ON REGIONAL COURTS THAT ALREADY LEANED CONSERVATIVE  HIS ADMINISTRATION NOW AIMS TO FILL VACANCIES IN REGIONAL COURTS FROM STATES REPRESENTED BY DEMOCRATIC SENATORS LEONARD LEO  AN OUTSIDE ADVISOR TO TRUMP WHO HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL ON JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS INCLUDING GORSUCH S  SAID THE WHITE HOUSE HAS THE SAME CRITERIA FOR PICKING CONSERVATIVE NOMINEES NO MATTER THE STATE BUT LEO SAID   YOU VE GOT TO ENGAGE A LITTLE MORE   IN A MORE INTENSE DEGREE OF CONSULTATION   WITH DEMOCRATS THAN WITH REPUBLICANS  SO THAT TAKES A LITTLE TIME THE WHITE HOUSE DID NOT RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT SOME NOMINATIONS HAVE BEEN LESS CONTENTIOUS  WITH THE WHITE HOUSE AND DEMOCRATIC SENATORS ABLE TO AGREE MICHAEL SCUDDER AND AMY ST  EVE  TWO TRUMP NOMINEES FOR THE CHICAGO BASED 7TH U S  CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS  ARE BACKED BY

THEY UNDERSTAND THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO APPOINT CONSERVATIVE JUDGES BUT THEY ARE WILLING TO WORK IN GOOD FAITH TO FIND CONSENSUS NOMINEES  KANG ADDED THERE ARE 148 VACANCIES IN THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY  WITH 68 PENDING NOMINEES  TRUMP INHERITED A LARGE NUMBER OF VACANCIES IN PART BECAUSE MCCONNELL AND HIS FELLOW SENATE REPUBLICANS REFUSED TO CONFIRM OBAMA S NOMINEES TO FILL SOME OF THE

20180506,entertainment,music,2,WHY GO THROUGH THE TURMOIL OF RE FORMING A BELOVED BUT LONG DORMANT BAND WHOSE PLACE IN POP HISTORY IS SECURE  IN 2018  A BETTER QUESTION IS  WHY NOT WE DECIDED WE WERE GOING TO NEVER RETURN TO IT RATHER THAN GO BACK AND TRY TO FIGURE EVERYTHING OUT  TANYA DONELLY SAID  REFERRING TO THE IMPLOSION OF HER BAND BELLY 23 YEARS AGO  FACING FORWARD HAS BEEN SUCH A HEALTHY MODEL  IM STARTING TO APPLY IT TO A LOT OF THINGS IN MY LIFE MS  DONELLY  51  WAS PHONING DURING A BREAK IN REHEARSALS WITH THE BAND  WHO JUST RELEASED DOVE  ITS THIRD ALBUM  OR ITS FIRST SINCE SEASON 6 OF SEINFELD  TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY  THE BAND IS BACK PLAYING IN THE BASSIST GAIL GREENWOODS RHODE ISLAND BASEMENT  KNOWN AS THE ROCK N ROLL CONTROL CENTER  JUST AS IT DID WHEN MS  DONELLY PARLAYED HER STATUS AS AN INDIE ROCK LIFER INTO MAINSTREAM POP SUCCESS WITH BELLYS 1993 DEBUT STAR  THEN FLAMED OUT SHORTLY AFTER ITS SECOND ALBUM  KING  TWO YEARS LATER  I THINK WE HAVE AN EXTREMELY FORTUNATE COMPLEMENTARY SET OF SKILLS  SHE SAID  WE WERE AWARE OF IT AND THEN WE LOST SIGHT OF IT  WHICH IS A VERY 20 SOMETHING THING TO DO WHAT WAS ONCE A LIFE CONSUMING  DEEPLY ROMANTIC  OR AT LEAST DEEPLY ROMANTICIZED  STRUGGLE TO GET SIGNED  GET HEARD AND GET ALONG IS NOW  FOR MANY BANDS OF A CERTAIN VINTAGE  A MORE COMFORTABLE EXPERIENCE  FREE OF THE PRESSURES THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR DEMISE DECADES AGO  THEY  AS BELLY DOES NOW  HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER HOW THEY TOUR AND HOW THEY MAKE AND RELEASE NEW MUSIC  IT DOESNT HAVE THAT FEEL OF A BIOLOGICAL IMPERATIVE  MS  DONELLY SAID OF THE 90S ERA INDIE BANDS WHO HAVE HAD CREATIVELY RESURGENT SECOND LIVES  MANY HAIL FROM BELLYS PEER GROUP IN THE BOSTON AREA  INCLUDING DINOSAUR JR  MISSION OF BURMA AND THE BREEDERS  WHICH MS  DONELLY WAS ONCE IN  HER STEPSISTER KRISTIN HERSH  WITH WHOM SHE PLAYED IN THROWING MUSES IN THE LATE 80S AND EARLY 90S  WAS AT THE FOREFRONT OF CROWDSOURCING RECORDS DIRECTLY FROM FANS  A NOW COMMON PRACTICE BELLY USED TO HELP FINANCE DOVE KRISTIN WAS A COMPLETE PIONEER AND JUST WATCHING THAT DEVELOP WAS REALLY INSPIRING  MS  DONELLY SAID  I LIKE THE POROUSNESS OF IT ANYONE CHARMED BY THE MIX OF MELODIC HOOKS AND IMAGISTIC LYRICS EXEMPLIFIED BY BELLYS BREAKOUT HIT FEED THE TREE WILL FIND A WAY INTO DOVE  SHINY ONE  A SINGLE  IS CONFIDENT AND PROPULSIVE  WHILE STARS ALIGN IS UNRELENTINGLY SUNNY RADIO FRIENDLY POP  WHETHER OR NOT RADIO FRIENDS IT BACK THIS SOUNDS INSANE  BUT WE DIDNT HAVE ONE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WE WANTED THIS ALBUM TO SOUND LIKE  WE JUST STARTED WRITING  MS  DONELLY SAID  WITH MS  GREENWOOD AND THE DRUMMER CHRIS GORMAN LIVING IN RHODE ISLAND  MS  DONELLY IN MASSACHUSETTS  AND THE GUITARIST TOM GORMAN IN UPSTATE NEW YORK  THE SONGS WERE LARGELY COMPOSED SENDING IDEAS OVER EMAIL ONE OF THE NEW ALBUMS STANDOUTS  THE SLOW BURN HUMAN CHILD  ADDRESSES THE BUBBLE OF FAME THAT BURST QUICKLY AS DIRECTLY AS MS  DONELLYS LYRICS ALLOW  TO BE HONEST  THAT IS A LETTER TO MYSELF  SHE SAID  HOW TO WEAVE WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE INTO YOUR PRESENT IN A WAY THAT IS CONSTRUCTIVE  ITS EASY TO HANG ON TO GARBAGE SINCE BELLYS BREAKUP  MS  GREENWOOD HAS PLAYED WITH L7 AND BIF NAKED  WHILE TOM AND CHRIS GORMAN WORK IN COMMERCIAL PHOTOGRAPHY  MS  DONELLY RELEASED FOUR SOLO ALBUMS AND RAISED TWO DAUGHTERS WITH HER HUSBAND OF 22 YEARS  SHE ALSO BECAME A POSTPARTUM DOULA  AND WHILE SHE STOPS SHORT OF CREDITING THAT WORK WITH THE BANDS REVIVAL  IT DID MAKE RECONCILIATION OF THE ESTRANGED BAND MEMBERS FEEL LIKE A NATURAL BYPRODUCT OF MATURING  I DONT THINK I CONSCIOUSLY WAS DOING IT FOR ANY SELF IMPROVEMENT REASONS  THAT WAS JUST KIND OF A HAPPY ACCIDENT  SHE SAID A FRIENDLY  INSIDE JOKE LADEN ICEBREAKER EMAIL CHAIN BEGAT THE SUCCESSFUL DUSTING OFF OF SOME OLD SONGS IN THE CONTROL CENTER  THEN A COUPLE OF NEW SONGS THAT FELT RIGHT  THEN A HANDFUL OF SHOWS IN 2016 BEFORE COMMITTING TO A NEW ALBUM HELPING TO KEEP PRIORITIES IN CHECK WAS MS  GREENWOODS DISCOVERY  JUST SIX WEEKS BEFORE THEIR FIRST REUNION DATES  THAT SHE HAD CANCER  RATHER THAN ADD URGENCY OR UPEND PLANS  THIS JUST REINFORCED THE NOTION THAT BELLY WASNT WORTH REVIVING UNLESS IT REMAINED A RESPITE FROM REAL LIFE TROUBLES RATHER THAN A SOURCE OF THEM I DONT MEAN TO SAY WE WOULDNT HAVE BEEN LIKE THIS IF IT HAD HAPPENED IN THE 90S  BUT BACK THEN EVERYTHING WAS SO SERIOUS  SAID MS  GREENWOOD  WHO DESCRIBED HERSELF AS A WALKING PETRI DISH OF FAST DIVIDING CELLS  AND NOW ITS LIKE  ILL TELL YOU WHATS SERIOUS MS  DONELLY HAS DRAWN RECENT INSPIRATION FROM ARTISTS WHO FOLLOWED IN HER FOOTSTEPS SUCH AS PHOEBE BRIDGERS AND THE BRITISH SISTER ACT COLOUR ME WEDNESDAY  BUT SHE IS WARY THAT HER ROLE AMONG THE WAVE OF SUCCESSFUL FEMALE FRONTED BANDS IN THE 90S IS SOMETIMES MISUNDERSTOOD  THERES THIS ASSUMPTION THAT EVERY SINGLE FEMALE ARTIST FROM THE TIME WAS HANGING OUT AND THAT IT FELT LIKE A MOVEMENT  SHE SAID  THAT ALWAYS STOPS ME IN MY TRACKS  EVEN MY DAUGHTER HAS ASKED ME THE WORLD THAT GREETS BELLY NOW OFFERS NEW CHALLENGES  INCLUDING A RAPPER NAMED BELLY  THERES MISUNDERSTANDINGS ON A WEEKLY BASIS  MS  DONELLY SAID  BUT THIS TIME ITS JUST THE FOUR OF THEM IN A VAN  NO ROADIES  NO TRUCKS  NO BUSES  NO DRAMA  AND THEY WONT NEED THE DRAMA FOR CREATIVE INSPIRATION AS THEY KEEP WRITING NEW SONGS  TOM GORMAN HAS ALREADY BEEN EMAILING NEW SNIPPETS I FEEL LIKE LIFE IS ENDLESSLY COMPLICATED  MS  DONELLY SAID  AND HUMAN INTERACTION IS AN ENDLESS MINE OF MATERIAL

MOVED BACK  ALTHOUGH HER MOTHER  MARIE LOUISE BOWERS  STAYED OUT WEST THAT ARRANGEMENT WORKED  MOSTLY  I DID TALK TO MY MOM ON A DAILY BASIS  THATS KIND OF THE RELATIONSHIP WE HAD  EVEN WHEN SHE WAS IN CALIFORNIA  MS  RUBEN SAID BUT LAST YEAR MS  BOWERS  87  STARTED HAVING TROUBLE GETTING AROUND  AND MS  RUBEN FELT THAT HELPING HER MOTHER FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY WAS AT BEST A DIFFICULT PROSPECT  IN JANUARY  MS  RUBEN MOVED HER MOTHER TO SUNRISE AT MILL BASIN  IN BROOKLYN JUST IN CASE SHE FELL  I KNOW THAT THERES SOMETHING HERE  VERSUS HOW AM I GOING TO HELP HER WHEN SHES IN WALNUT CREEK  CALIF  AND IM IN BROOKLYN  PEACE OF MIND  THAT HAS BEEN A HUGE GIFT  MS  RUBEN SAID  AND COINCIDENTALLY  SOON AFTER MS  BOWERS MOVED EAST  MS  RUBEN HAD TO UNDERGO A BATTERY OF TESTS FOR WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE A NONCANCEROUS BRAIN MASS  AND SHE WAS COMFORTED BY HAVING HER MOTHER NEARBY MS  RUBEN AND HER MOTHER ARE AN EXAMPLE OF A PHENOMENON THAT IS DRIVING AN INCREASE IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF SENIOR HOUSING ACROSS THE UNITED STATES  MORE ASSISTED LIVING  INDEPENDENT LIVING AND CONTINUING CARE RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES ARE BEING BUILT  NOT NECESSARILY IN THE WARMER CLIMATES WHERE SENIORS HAVE TRADITIONALLY RETIRED  LIKE FLORIDA AND ARIZONA  BUT WHEREVER ECONOMIES ARE ROBUST AND BOOMING  IN PLACES LIKE NEW YORK  DENVER  CHICAGO AND ATLANTA IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR TODAYS SENIORS TO LIVE WELL INTO THEIR 80S  90S  EVEN PAST 100  AND WHEN THEY CAN NO LONGER BE ENTIRELY INDEPENDENT  MANY ARE MOVING TO BE NEAR THEIR ADULT CHILDREN FOR HELP IN THE LAST STAGE OF THEIR LIVES THE NEED FOR MORE OF THIS KIND OF HOUSING IS ALSO DRIVEN BY THE NEED TO COMBAT WHAT MANY SEE AS A GROWING PROBLEM OF ISOLATION AMONG PEOPLE IN THIS OLDER GENERATION  OF AMERICANS AGE 65 AND OLDER  28 PERCENT  11 MILLION PEOPLE  LIVE ALONE  ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES CENSUS BUREAU  AND THE NATIONAL COUNCIL ON AGING ESTIMATES THAT EIGHT MILLION ADULTS OVER THE AGE OF 50 ARE AFFECTED BY ISOLATION  WHICH CAN HARM BOTH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH  SAID LISA MARSH RYERSON  PRESIDENT OF THE AARP FOUNDATION  WHICH INTRODUCED CONNECT2AFFECT IN 2016 TO HELP RAISE AWARENESS AND OFFER SOLUTIONS TO SENIOR ISOLATION MS  RYERSON SAID THAT THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF PROLONGED ISOLATION HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE THE EQUIVALENT OF SMOKING 15 CIGARETTES A DAY  ACCORDING TO A STUDY IN PERSPECTIVES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE  A STUDY IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ALSO FOUND THAT SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LONELINESS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER RISK OF MORTALITY IN ADULTS 52 AND OLDER SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES  WHERE PEOPLE OF SIMILAR AGES AND ABILITIES LIVE TOGETHER  CAN HELP COMBAT THAT ISOLATION  AS CAN MOVING CLOSER TO ADULT CHILDREN  WHO CAN THEN MORE EASILY HELP TAKE CARE OF THEIR PARENTS NEEDS ITS OFTEN THE CASE THAT THE ADULT CHILD  AND USUALLY ADULT DAUGHTER  VISITS THEIR PARENT AND FINDS THERES SOMETHING THATS NOT COMPLETELY COPACETIC  SAID BETH BURNHAM MACE  CHIEF ECONOMIST AND DIRECTOR OF OUTREACH FOR THE NATIONAL INVESTMENT CENTER FOR SENIORS HOUSING   CARE  THEY LEFT THE STOVE ON  OR HAVE AMBULATORY NEEDS  OR TROUBLE WITH MEDS  SOMETHING SETS OFF AN ALARM BELL THAT THEY NEED SOME TYPE OF ASSISTANCE AS MS  RYERSON POINTED OUT  WE NEED MEANINGFUL CONNECTIONS  WHEN SENIOR PARENTS MOVE CLOSER TO THEIR ADULT CHILDREN  THOSE CONNECTIONS ARE OFTEN MORE FREQUENT  AND MORE PERSONAL THAT IS WHAT DROVE LINDA GRAMATKY SMITH AND KENDALL SMITH TO MOVE TO THE CEDAR CREST RETIREMENT COMMUNITY IN POMPTON PLAINS  N J  THEY HAD RAISED THEIR CHILDREN IN NORTHERN NEW JERSEY  BUT ONCE THEY BECAME EMPTY NESTERS  THEY MOVED TO WESTPORT  CONN  WHERE MS  SMITH HAD GROWN UP AND STILL OWNED HER CHILDHOOD HOME BUT WHEN THEIR DAUGHTER  WHO LIVES IN NEW JERSEY  WAS WIDOWED FIVE YEARS AGO  THEY FOUND THAT DRIVING BACK AND FORTH TO HELP HER WITH HER THREE CHILDREN WAS NOT IDEAL  IN AN UNCANNILY PRESCIENT MOVE  MR  SMITH  NOW 85  HAD PUT DOWN A REFUNDABLE DEPOSIT AT CEDAR CREST MORE THAN A DECADE AGO  JUST IN CASE THEY EVER WANTED TO MOVE THERE LIVING IN ONE OF THESE COMMUNITIES  OF COURSE  IS NOT CHEAP  THE SMITHS PAID AN ENTRANCE FEE OF ABOUT  000  AND THEIR MONTHLY RENT IS  500  WHICH IS NOT UNUSUAL  ACCORDING TO THE AARP  THE ORGANIZATION ESTIMATES THAT ENTRANCE FEES TYPICALLY RANGE FROM  000 TO  MILLION  AND MONTHLY RENTS CAN BE ANYWHERE FROM  000 TO  000 FOR THE SMITHS  HOWEVER  IT WAS WORTH IT  MS  SMITH  75  WAS RESISTANT AT FIRST ABOUT GIVING UP THEIR HOME  BUT DID A TOTAL 180  SHE SAID  SOON AFTER MOVING IN  NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE CLOSER TO THEIR DAUGHTER AND GRANDCHILDREN  BUT BECAUSE IT HAD IMPROVED THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE SHE HAS RETURNED TO PAINTING WATERCOLORS AND IS ON THE RESIDENT ADVISORY COUNCIL  AND HER HUSBAND SINGS IN THE CHORALE SO MANY PEOPLE TOLD US COME EARLIER THAN WAITING AND ITS TRUE  SHE SAID  YOU JUST HAVE A LITTLE MORE ENERGY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT SUCH A COMMUNITY OFFERS THERE SEEMS TO BE PLENTY OF MONEY BEHIND THE CONSTRUCTION OF THESE CENTERS  IN PART BECAUSE THE RECESSION DID NOT HAVE THE SAME EFFECT ON SENIOR HOUSING THAT IT DID ON THE REST OF THE HOUSING MARKET WE WERE KIND OF A NICHE  SAID DAVID FRESHWATER  CHAIRMAN OF WATERMARK RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES  WHICH APPEALED TO THE KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO INVESTED IN THINGS LIKE STUDENT HOUSING AND SELF STORAGE WATERMARK  WHICH IS BASED IN TUCSON  HAS 52 LOCATIONS AND IS CURRENTLY BUILDING OR RENOVATING AN ADDITIONAL 10 SENIOR HOUSING CENTERS  INCLUDING ONE IN A FORMER JEHOVAHS WITNESSES DORM IN BROOKLYN HEIGHTS DURING THE RECESSION  BECAUSE IT PERFORMED SO WELL  A LOT OF THE BIGGER MORE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS TOOK NOTICE AND SAID  LETS INVEST SOME CAPITAL INTO THE MARKET  MR  FRESHWATER SAID INVESTORS DONT EXPECT SENIOR HOUSING TO REACT TO THE FUTURE WHIMS OF THE HOUSING MARKET EITHER  ALTHOUGH OCCUPANCY RATES DIPPED SLIGHTLY  TO 88 3 PERCENT  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR  FROM 89 2 PERCENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2016 INVESTMENT IN SENIOR LIVING IS SEEN AS A PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFIER  MS  MACE SAID  IT DOESNT NECESSARILY RESPOND TO THE SAME BUSINESS CYCLES AS OTHER TYPES OF REAL ESTATE  IT TENDS TO BE MORE OF A NEED BASED PROPERTY TYPE THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE BROKERAGE FIRM MARCUS   MILLICHAP ALSO FORECASTS THAT THE DEMAND FOR SENIOR HOUSING IS STRENGTHENING  IN PART BECAUSE OLDER HOMEOWNERS WHO MAY HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO SELL THEIR HOMES WHEN THE HOUSING MARKET WAS WEAK ARE NOW MORE WILLING TO SELL THEIR HOMES AND MOVE HOME PRICES ARE UP  A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDNT WANT TO SELL DURING THE RECESSION  SO THEY STAYED IN THEIR HOMES A LOT LONGER THAN THEY MAY HAVE WANTED TO  BUT NOW THAT HOME PRICES ARE HIGHER AGAIN  THEY CAN SELL THEM  SAID JOHN CHANG  FIRST VICE PRESIDENT OF RESEARCH SERVICES FOR MARCUS   MILLICHAP  THEY HAVE EQUITY BUILT UP THAT THEY CAN USE FOR THEIR NEXT STAGE OF LIFE THE NEW TAX LAW  WHICH DOUBLED THE STANDARD DEDUCTION FOR MOST TAXPAYERS  BUT REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF MORTGAGE INTEREST THAT HOMEOWNERS CAN DEDUCT  MAY ADD ANOTHER INCENTIVE FOR OLDER HOMEOWNERS TO SELL THE TAX ADVANTAGES OF OWNING A HOME ARE MAYBE GOING AWAY FOR SOME PEOPLE  MR  CHANG SAID  AND AT THE SAME TIME  THE VALUES ARE ELEVATED  SO SENIORS WHO HAD BEEN AGING IN PLACE NOW HAVE MORE INCENTIVE TO MAKE A LIFESTYLE CHANGE ERICKSON LIVING  BASED IN CATONSVILLE  MD  HAS 20 SENIOR PROPERTIES  INCLUDING CEDAR CREST  AND IS DEVELOPING SEVEN MORE  SAID ADAM E  KANE  THE ORGANIZATIONS SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF REAL ESTATE ACQUISITION AND CORPORATE AFFAIRS THE COMPANY LOOKS TO TWO TYPES OF AREAS WHEN DECIDING WHERE TO BUILD NEW FACILITIES  HE SAID  THE FIRST IS INFILL MARKETS  PLACES THAT ARE ALREADY DENSELY POPULATED  LIKE NORTHERN NEW JERSEY  FOR SENIORS WHO EITHER WANT TO STAY IN THE AREA WHERE THEY HAVE LIVED OR MOVE CLOSER TO ADULT CHILDREN THE SECOND IS WHAT MR  KANE CALLS GROWTH CORRIDOR MARKETS  WHERE THE COMPANY SEES POPULATION MOVING EVEN IF THERES REALLY NOT A PLETHORA OF AGING DEMOGRAPHICS IN THE LOCAL AREA  BUT ITS A GROWTH MARKET WHERE YOU HAVE A LOT OF ADULT CHILDREN MOVING TO AND LIVING THERE IN 2008  FOR EXAMPLE  THE COMPANY OPENED ASHBY PONDS IN LOUDOUN COUNTY  VA  WHEN CONSTRUCTION STARTED  IT WAS NOT CONSIDERED A DENSELY POPULATED AREA  BUT IT ATTRACTED MOSTLY YOUNGER FAMILIES SEEKING TO GET NEWER HOMES AND LARGER HOMES  MR  KANE SAID THE FACILITY WAS SUCCESSFUL IN ATTRACTING SENIORS FROM THE INNER WASHINGTON SUBURBS  HE SAID  EITHER BECAUSE THEY HAVE FAMILY THERE OR ARE LOOKING FOR NEWER PRODUCT AND MORE VALUE  ERICKSON IS CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH THE ZONING PROCESS TO BUILD A SIMILAR FACILITY IN FAIRFAX  VA  FOR THE SAME REASON NO MATTER WHAT THE ECONOMY DOES  MS  MACE SAID  SENIOR HOUSING IS GOING TO BE NEEDED IN THE FUTURE  ESPECIALLY AS THE BABY BOOMER GENERATION AGES  ACCORDING TO THE CENSUS BUREAU  THE PERCENTAGE OF THE AMERICAN POPULATION 65 AND OLDER WILL INCREASE BY 6 PERCENT  UP TO 75 5 MILLION PEOPLE  BY 2030 MS  MACE PREDICTED THAT THE KINDS OF FACILITIES THAT CURRENTLY EXIST WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN DEMAND  BUT THERE MAY BE OTHER KINDS OF HOUSING AS WELL  INCLUDING COGENERATIONAL AND EVEN GOLDEN GIRLS TYPE SETUPS  WHERE SINGLE OLDER ADULTS CAN CHOOSE TO LIVE TOGETHER WEVE SEEN THE VALUES OF LIVING IN SENIOR HOUSING  SOCIALIZATION  HOSPITALITY  BETTER NUTRITION  BETTER EXERCISE  MS  MACE SAID  AND WHEN IT IS THE BABY

PROBLEM IS LARGER THAN PREVIOUSLY ACKNOWLEDGED MEMBERS OF CONGRESS EXPRESSED ALARM AND DEMANDED ANSWERS AFTER AN ASSOCIATED PRESS INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT REPORTS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AMONG KIDS ON U S  MILITARY BASES AND AT PENTAGON RUN SCHOOLS ARE GETTING LOST IN A DEAD ZONE OF JUSTICE THAT OFTEN LEAVES BOTH VICTIM AND OFFENDER WITHOUT HELP WITH AT LEAST THREE POTENTIAL LEGISLATIVE FIXES BEING DRAFTED  MILITARY OFFICIALS HAVE HAD A CLEAR MESSAGE DURING BRIEFINGS WITH LAWMAKERS AND THEIR STAFFS  WE CAN HANDLE THIS ON OUR OWN  IT S A STRATEGY THAT BEGAN MONTHS AGO  AFTER THE PENTAGON RECEIVED AP S QUESTIONS AND WELL BEFORE OFFICIALS UNDERSTOOD THE SCOPE OR SEVERITY OF THE PROBLEM IN MARCH  AP DOCUMENTED NEARLY 600 SEX ASSAULT CASES AMONG CHILDREN AND TEENS ON U S  BASES WORLDWIDE OVER A 10

SEVERAL STATES AND OVERSEAS HAD NO OR ONLY A FEW SUCH SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES ONE TEXAS CONGRESSMAN HAS FILED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD DIRECT THE PENTAGON TO TRANSFER CASES TO STATE AUTHORITIES  WHO UNLIKE THE MILITARY OR FEDERAL PROSECUTORS HAVE MUCH MORE EXPERIENCE HANDLING JUVENILE OFFENDERS  AT LEAST TWO SENATE OFFICES ARE DRAFTING LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS THAT AP S REPORTING REVEALED IN RESPONSE  OFFICIALS FROM THE SERVICE BRANCHES AND THE PENTAGON SCHOOL SYSTEM LOBBIED FOR TIME TO FIX THE PROBLEM THEMSELVES  ACCORDING TO INTERVIEWS AND RECORDS SCHOOL SYSTEM OFFICIALS HAVE TOLD AP THEY WERE DEVELOPING NEW RULES FOR RESPONDING TO THE SEXUAL VIOLENCE  THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT PROMISED MORE BROADLY TO TAKE  APPROPRIATE ACTIONS  TO HELP JUVENILES INVOLVED IN SEX ASSAULTS

INTERNAL REFORMS  SHE MIGHT STILL BACK LEGISLATION A STAFFER IN ANOTHER SENATOR S OFFICE SAID THE MILITARY BRIEFERS THOUGHT THEY WERE GETTING THE PROBLEM UNDER CONTROL THEY DID NOT WANT ANY LEGISLATIVE ACTION ON THIS  SAID THE STAFFER  WHO WAS NOT AUTHORIZED TO SPEAK PUBLICLY AND DID SO ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY  THE STAFFER THOUGHT LEGISLATION WOULD BE NEEDED SOME MILITARY OFFICIALS BEGAN DISCUSSING HOW TO LIMIT CONGRESSIONAL INVOLVEMENT LAST FALL  AS AP WAS GATHERING RECORDS AND DATA ABOUT CHILD ON CHILD SEXUAL ASSAULTS ON BASES  AT THAT POINT  THE PENTAGON WAS NOT TRACKING THE PROBLEM  BUT SOME MILITARY OFFICIALS EXPECTED NEWS COVERAGE TO GENERATE ATTENTION FROM CONGRESS AP S INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT MANY REPORTS WERE SHELVED BY MILITARY CRIMINAL INVESTIGATORS  WHILE OTHER CASES WERE UNPROSECUTED BY CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES  WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE MILITARY LAW DOESN T APPLY TO SERVICE MEMBERS  FAMILIES I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS ON OUR OWN  AND DO NOT NEED ANY LEGISLATIVE ASSISTANCE  COL  WILLIAM SMOOT  THE ARMY S CHIEF OF CRIMINAL LAW  WROTE IN AN OCTOBER EMAIL TO FELLOW JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL LAWYERS  SMOOT ASKED COLLEAGUES TO

HAMMERSTEIN TRANSFORMED FROM A PAIR OF HARDWORKING MEN IN THE THEATER INTO AN ENTERPRISE  AND BY THE TIME I WAS GROWING UP IN THE 70S  THAT ENTERPRISE WAS AN ESTABLISHED BRAND  RELIABLY STODGY AND COMFORTING AND FIRMLY ENTRENCHED IN EISENHOWER ERA VALUES AND  FOR ME  NOT ALL THAT INTERESTING  HOW THESE WRITERS WENT FROM BEING CONSIDERED BRASH  HUNGRY INNOVATORS TO DRAB GRAY FLANNEL SUIT TYPES  AND HOW THEY HAVE BEEN RESTORED TO THEIR RIGHTFUL POSITION AS THE PROGENITORS OF VIRTUALLY ALL MODERN MUSICAL THEATER  IS THE STORY OF TODD S  PURDUMS AFFECTIONATE AND RICHLY RESEARCHED SOMETHING WONDERFUL  RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEINS BROADWAY REVOLUTION AS THE VERY AVATARS OF MIDDLEBROW AMERICAN CULTURE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE 20TH CENTURY  RICHARD RODGERS AND OSCAR HAMMERSTEIN II HAVE HAD THEIR LIVES AND WORK EXAMINED  APPRAISED AND DISSECTED WITH WEARYING REGULARITY  I WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD PRESSED TO COME UP WITH REASONS FOR ANOTHER BOOK ABOUT THEM  AND YET SOMETHING WONDERFUL OFFERS A FRESH LOOK AT THE MILIEU AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE CREATION OF SOME OF THE MUSICAL THEATERS GREATEST AND MOST ENDURING TREASURES AS THE TITLE AND SUBTITLE SUGGEST  PURDUM APPROACHES THIS OEUVRE AS A FAN  AND WHILE HE IS NOT AFRAID TO BE CRITICAL OF SOME OF HIS SUBJECTS WORK  HIS PURPOSE IS NOT TO INTERROGATE OR RECONTEXTUALIZE RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEINS EXTRAORDINARY ACCOMPLISHMENTS  RATHER  TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE MOUNTAIN OF DOCUMENTATION ALREADY AVAILABLE AND SOME DELIGHTFUL FIRSTHAND INTERVIEWS  HE METICULOUSLY RECREATES THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH THESE SEMINAL WORKS WERE CREATED  PURDUMS EVOCATIONS OF A WAR TORN AMERICA DISCOVERING AND EMBRACING OKLAHOMA  SUCCEED IN MAKING THAT SHOW SEEM AS VITAL AND ALL ENCOMPASSING A PHENOMENON AS HAMILTON 70 YEARS LATER AFTER TWO BRISK CHAPTERS INTRODUCING EACH OF THE MEN  PURDUM BRINGS THEM TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT SUGGESTS A CERTAIN INEXORABLE PULL  THEY HAVE SO MANY THINGS IN COMMON  HAMMERSTEINS ELDEST CHILDREN WERE ACTUALLY DELIVERED BY RODGERSS FATHER  THAT IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE THEM NOT WORKING TOGETHER AT SOME POINT  AND SO HERE THEY ARE IN 1942  HAMMERSTEIN WEIGHED DOWN BY A STRING OF FAILURES  AND RODGERS AT THE END OF HIS COLLABORATION WITH THE BRILLIANT BUT DANGEROUSLY UNRELIABLE LORENZ HART  WHILE MOST SHOW BUSINESS BIOGRAPHIES TRAFFIC IN THE TALE OF YOUNG GENIUSES FINDING THEIR WAY  HERE WE HAVE THE SURPRISING STORY OF MIDDLE AGED MEN WRESTLING WITH REDEFINING THEMSELVES AT A MOMENT OF CRISIS  SITTING IN AN AISLE SEAT AS THEY BRING OKLAHOMA  AND CAROUSEL TO LIFE IS ENORMOUS FUN IMAGEPURDUM  A CONTRIBUTING EDITOR AT VANITY FAIR  IS A POLITICAL WRITER BY TRADE  AND UNDERSTANDABLY HAS A MUCH EASIER TIME PARSING HAMMERSTEINS LYRICS THAN HE DOES MAKING SENSE OF RODGERSS MUSIC  BUT TO HIS CREDIT  HE GAMELY OFFERS SOME ASTUTE MUSICAL ANALYSIS  I PARTICULARLY ENJOYED THE MUSICAL DIRECTOR BRUCE POMAHACS OBSERVATION THAT RODGERSS GENIUS LAY IN HOW MANY WAYS HE COULD TAKE YOU AWAY FROM DO AND THEN BRING YOU BACK TO IT  PURDUM ALSO UNEARTHS AN ALARMING CHARGE BY AGNES DE MILLE THAT RODGERS STOLE THE PRAELUDIUM IN THE SOUND OF MUSIC FROM THE 16TH CENTURY COMPOSER ORLANDO DI LASSO   MY OWN RESEARCH DOESNT CONFIRM THIS  BUT REMARKS FROM THE ARRANGERS TRUDE RITTMANN AND ROBERT RUSSELL BENNETT PROVIDE CONSIDERABLE TESTIMONY THROUGHOUT THE TEXT THAT RODGERS HAD LITTLE COMPUNCTION ABOUT TAKING CREDIT FOR OTHERS WORK CERTAIN PRECONCEPTIONS CLING TO THE RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN MYTHOS  AND PURDUM DOESNT MANAGE TO SHAKE OUR FAMILIAR IMPRESSION OF THE TWO AS AN EMOTIONAL ODD COUPLE  HAMMERSTEIN THE WARM  NURTURING  SINCERE LIBERAL  DESPITE BEING A NOTORIOUS TIGHTWAD  RODGERS THE COLD  CONTROLLING  INACCESSIBLE  AND LEERING  GENIUS  INDEED  THE CLOSEST RODGERS GETS TO OUR SYMPATHIES IS DURING THE THREE MONTHS HE SPENDS IN PAYNE WHITNEY BEING TREATED FOR DEPRESSION AFTER THE TELEVISION BROADCAST OF CINDERELLA BUT PURDUM SHINES WHEN DEMONSTRATING HAMMERSTEINS MASTERLY SKILLS AS AN ADAPTER AND EDITOR  HIS UNDERSTANDING OF STRUCTURE AND CHARACTER ARE ON AMPLE DISPLAY IN THE CHAPTERS DETAILING THE BIRTHS OF OKLAHOMA  CAROUSEL AND SOUTH PACIFIC  AND THE BOOK IS CLEAREYED ABOUT THE FAULTS OF HIS LATER LIBRETTOS  IN AN EXCERPT FROM HIS ESSENTIAL ESSAY NOTES ON LYRICS  HAMMERSTEIN CASTIGATES HIMSELF FOR THE INSINCERITY OF HIS EARLY SONGS  AND WE SEE IN THAT MOMENT THAT HIS INSISTENCE ON SINCERITY ABOVE ALL OTHER VALUES WILL BOTH BOLSTER HIS GENIUS AND ULTIMATELY LIMIT IT AFTER THE TEAM HAS THEIR FIRST FAILURE  THE AMBITIOUS BUT CLUMSY ALLEGRO IN 1947  PURDUM WRITES  THE ERA OF INNOVATION WAS OVER FOR THEM  THE ERA OF EMPIRE LAY AHEAD  AND THE BOOK LIKEWISE MOVES FROM THE THRILL OF CREATION TO THE MORE QUOTIDIAN DETAILS OF DEAL MAKING AND MAINTENANCE AS RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN GROW FROM SONGWRITERS INTO THEATRICAL TITANS  FROM THE SHADOWS EMERGES THE PARTNERS LAWYER  HOWARD REINHEIMER  WHOSE TIGHTFISTED AND FARSIGHTED SCHEMES NET THE BOYS EXCEPTIONAL WEALTH AND AN UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN WORK  WHEN JOSHUA LOGAN HAS TO BEG FOR A WRITING CREDIT ON SOUTH PACIFIC  HIS EMASCULATION AND ULTIMATE REGRET ARE HEARTBREAKING TO READ ABOUT   MARY RODGERS ON HER FATHERS SUPPOSED ACUMEN  HE WAS AN ATROCIOUS BUSINESSMAN  HE JUST MADE A LOT OF MONEY UNDERNEATH THE UMBRELLA OF THIS MAMMOTH PARTNERSHIP  MANY STORIES PEEK OUT  HINTED AT BUT UNTOLD  THE COLLABORATION AND FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN DE MILLE AND RITTMANN  TWO BRILLIANT WOMEN CREATING THEIR OWN ART AND VOCABULARY IN A ROOM RUN BY HIGHLY PRIVILEGED AND ENTITLED MEN  IS ONE SUCH TANTALIZING THREAD  INDEED  THE WOMEN IN THE STORIES OFTEN MAKE THE MOST INCISIVE IMPRESSIONS  FROM DIAHANN CARROLLS CONCLUSION THAT RODGERS WAS REALLY

COUNSEL AND HIS STAFF WERE GOING TO BE TRULY OBJECTIVE MR  MUELLERS ENDGAME REMAINS A MYSTERY  EVEN IF HE DETERMINES THE PRESIDENT BROKE THE LAW  A LONGSTANDING JUSTICE DEPARTMENT LEGAL FINDING SAYS PRESIDENTS CANNOT BE CHARGED WITH A CRIME WHILE THEY ARE IN OFFICE  THE SPECIAL COUNSEL TOLD MR  DOWD IN MARCH THAT THOUGH THE PRESIDENTS CONDUCT IS UNDER SCRUTINY  HE IS NOT A TARGET OF THE INVESTIGATION  MEANING MR  MUELLER DOES NOT EXPECT TO CHARGE HIM THE PROSPECT OF PARDONS IS ALSO AMONG MR  MUELLERS INQUIRIES  AND WHETHER MR  TRUMP OFFERED THEM TO A PAIR OF FORMER TOP AIDES TO INFLUENCE THEIR DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER TO COOPERATE WITH THE SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION MR  DOWD BROACHED THE IDEA WITH LAWYERS FOR BOTH OF THE ADVISERS  MR  FLYNN AND MR  MANAFORT  ACCORDING TO

IN LAWS HOMETOWN  WHEN WE HAD AN ARGUMENT  IT WAS OUR SECOND DAY THERE  AND ID LIKE TO ATTRIBUTE THE FIGHT TO THE STRESS OF TRAVEL  BUT BRUCE AND I CAN ARGUE IN A BOX  WITH A FOX  ON A STAIR OR ANYWHERE THE FIGHT  AS USUAL  WAS ABOUT HOW HE DOESNT LISTEN TO ME  I DONT REMEMBER THE SPECIFICS  BUT WHAT TYPICALLY HAPPENS IS HELL ASK ME ABOUT SOMETHING I JUST TOLD HIM MINUTES EARLIER  REVEALING THAT HE WASNT LISTENING  OR HELL START TALKING ABOUT A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TOPIC WHILE IM STILL SPEAKING  OR ILL ASK HIM A QUESTION  DO YOU WANT DESSERT  OR ARE THE KNICKS PLAYING TONIGHT   AND HE WONT ANSWER AT LEAST ONCE A DAY  I FIND MYSELF SAYING  I JUST TOLD YOU THAT IF IT HAPPENED OCCASIONALLY  O K  BUT THIS IS CHRONIC  THE PASSAGE OF TIME TENDS TO DISSOLVE THE DISCORD LIKE RUNNING WARM WATER OVER A BUCKET OF DRIED PLASTER  BUT SOMETIMES THE CONFLICT FEELS INSURMOUNTABLE AND I START TO THINK I CANT POSSIBLY SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH SOMEONE WHO DOESNT HEAR ME THATS HOW I FELT THAT MORNING WHEN I SAID  WELL  I WANT TO MAKE THIS CLEAR  FOR THE RECORD  I HATE THAT YOU DONT LISTEN TO ME  ITS NOT RIGHT  ITS NOT FAIR  AND IF I ONE DAY LEAVE YOU BECAUSE OF IT  DONT SAY I NEVER WARNED YOU AS SOON AS I SAID IT  I KNEW I SHOULDNT HAVE  MY SAVING GRACE  HE PROBABLY DIDNT HEAR ME MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE ARGUED FOR SO LONG IT HAS BECOME PART OF THE FABRIC OF OUR RELATIONSHIP  LIKE A BUNION  THOUGH OUR SQUABBLES DONT STOP US FROM HAVING A RELATIVELY NORMAL RELATIONSHIP  PEOPLE CAN WALK ON BUNIONS FOR YEARS  WE HAVE FAMILY DINNERS  WEEKLY DATES  WATCH TV TOGETHER  EXCHANGE CHRISTMAS GIFTS  IN FACT  THIS PAST CHRISTMAS HE BOUGHT ME ALEXA  WHICH I HAVE JUST STARTED USING ALEXA  PLAY HOLIDAY JAZZ MUSIC  ILL SAY  AND SHE DOES ALEXA  WHAT IS THE TEMPERATURE OUTSIDE  AND SHELL TELL ME AFTER A FEW DAYS  I REALIZED THAT ALEXA HEARS EVERYTHING I SAY AND RESPONDS EACH TIME  SOMETHING I HAVE FAILED TO GET FROM MY HUSBAND OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS ASK HER ANYTHING  MY HUSBAND SAID  LIKE THIS  ALEXA  WHATS 14 300 DIVIDED BY 25 ALEXA SAID NOTHING SO I SAID  ALEXA  WHATS 14 300 DIVIDED BY 25 14 300 DIVIDED BY 25 IS 572  SHE SAID I LOOKED AT MY HUSBAND  WELL  YOU DIDNT SAY IT VERY NICELY ALEXA NOT ONLY LISTENED TO ME  BUT SHE PROVIDED AN ADDED BONUS  SHE DIDNT SEEM TO LISTEN TO MY HUSBAND  HE GOT TO FEEL HOW I HAVE FELT FOR MOST OF OUR RELATIONSHIP RECENTLY I MENTIONED THE ISSUE OF BRUCES SELECTIVE HEARING TO SOME GIRLFRIENDS OVER BREAKFAST AT A LOCAL DINER  AND THEY CACKLED IN AGREEMENT  IT SEEMS MANY MEN HAVE AN AUDITORY IMPAIRMENT THAT DISRUPTS THEIR ABILITY TO HEAR CERTAIN TONES  LIKE THE SOUND OF THEIR WIFES VOICE  ITS LIKE THE WAY DOGS CAN HEAR CERTAIN TONES THAT WE CANT   EXCEPT THE OPPOSITE EVEN THE CASHIER AT THE DINER SYMPATHIZED  I TELL MY HUSBAND A THOUSAND TIMES TO DO SOMETHING  AND HE DOESNT HEAR ME  SHE SAID  I DONT KNOW WHY I BOTHER  I WIND UP DOING IT MYSELF THAT EVENING I WAS SITTING IN THE LIVING ROOM LISTENING TO THE JAZZ HOLIDAY MUSIC ALEXA HAD PUT ON FOR ME  WHEN I SAID  ALEXA THE MUSIC STOPPED  I PAUSED  JUST WANTED TO SEE IF YOU WERE LISTENING  I SAID THE LIGHT ON THE TOP OF THE MACHINE TURNED BLUISH GREEN AND THE SPEAKER MADE A CLUNKY SOUND  AS IF TO SAY  INDEED THE OTHER DAY  AS I SAT IN THE DINING ROOM WORKING  I COULD HEAR MY HUSBAND IN THE KITCHEN SNIFFING AS HE MADE MY SONS LUNCH SOUNDS LIKE YOURE GETTING SICK  I SAID I CANT HEAR YOU  HE SAID  HIS VOICE TRAILING OFF AS HE MOVED TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE KITCHEN ONE MIGHT THINK THERES NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT  YOU CANT FAULT SOMEONE FOR BEING TOO FAR AWAY  BUT WHATS REVEALING TO ME IS THE MATTER OF FACT WAY HE SAYS IT  THE WAY HE SHOWS NO CURIOSITY TO FIND OUT WHAT I SAID  IF REAL LIFE HAD SUBTITLES  HIS LINE FROM THAT EXCHANGE WOULD READ  I CANT HEAR YOU  AND IM ABSOLUTELY FINE WITH THAT MY HUSBANDS INABILITY TO HEAR ME TAKES ALL FORMS  THE OTHER DAY I WANTED TO TELL HIM I WOULD NOT BE GOING TO MY SONS SOCCER PRACTICE AS I HAD SAID I WOULD  AND I TRIED CALLING HIM  TEXTING HIM AND LEAVING HIM A VOICE MAIL MESSAGE  TO NO AVAIL AT TIMES LIKE THAT  ITS AS IF HES A FORTRESS AND NO MODE OF COMMUNICATION  NOT SWIMMING THE MOAT  FLYING OVERHEAD  DROPPING A NOTE NOR SENDING A FIERY MISSIVE OVER THE FORTRESS WALL  WILL REACH HIM SOMETIMES WHEN BRUCE DOESNT HEAR ME THESE DAYS  I LOOK OVER AT ALEXA TO SEE IF HER BLUE AND GREEN LIGHT WILL GO ON  AN INDICATION THAT SHE IS LISTENING  THOUGH IN SITUATIONS LIKE THAT MORNING  I DONT WANT HER TO BE  IM EMBARRASSED BY MY ANGER A FEW MONTHS AGO  BRUCE AND I WENT OUT TO BREAKFAST AND BEGAN TALKING ABOUT WHERE TO TAKE OUR SIX YEAR OLD SON FOR SPRING BREAK HOW ABOUT DISNEY  I SAID IM NOT SURE THATS THE RIGHT WEEK FOR IT  HE SAID  AND THEN HE PICKED UP HIS PHONE AND BEGAN READING A TEXT YOURE PROBABLY RIGHT  I SAID  MAYBE WE SHOULD GO IN SEPTEMBER HE CONTINUED TO READ HIS PHONE AS I SPOKE OR MAYBE WE SHOULD BRING A DEAD DOG TO DISNEY  I SAID  TO SEE IF HE WAS LISTENING  SOME PEOPLE CAN MULTITASK  MY HUSBAND IS NOT AMONG THEM  HE DIDNT EVEN LOOK UP AND IF THE DOG ISNT DEAD  YOU CAN ALWAYS KILL ONE SO YOU HAVE A DEAD DOG TO BRING  TO DISNEY NOTHING FINALLY  WITHOUT LOOKING UP  HE SAID  MY FATHERS IN THE HOSPITAL OH MY GOD  I SAID  WHAT HAPPENED MY SISTER SAYS HE MAY HAVE HAD A STROKE I FELT LIKE A SELF CENTERED HEEL  BUT THATS THE THING ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS  WHEN YOUR PARTNER DOES SOMETHING CHRONICALLY  LIKE BEING A BAD LISTENER  WE ALWAYS THINK THEY ARE DOING THAT ANNOYING THING EVEN WHEN THEYRE NOT  WERE NOT SEEING THEM  WERE SEEING WHO WE THINK THEY ARE  WHICH MEANS THAT IN THOSE MOMENTS WERE JUST SEEING AN EXTENSION OF OURSELVES WHEN I WAS IN ANALYSIS  I WOULD SOMETIMES SAY SOMETHING TO MY THERAPIST  PONDER IT  AND THEN SAY  I THINK YOU THINK IM STUPID  WHEN IN FACT SHE HAD SAID NOTHING  IF SHE WERE MY HUSBAND  I WOULD PROBABLY SAY  I THINK YOU THINK IM BORING IT TURNS OUT MY FATHER IN LAW HAD SUFFERED A STROKE THAT DAY  TWO  ACTUALLY  IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME  BUT HE HAS ALMOST FULLY RECOVERED AND IS AS CHIPPER AS EVER  MY HUSBAND NOW CALLS HIM NEARLY EVERY MORNING ON HIS WAY TO WORK  AND IF THE CONVERSATIONS GO AS THEY ALWAYS HAVE  MY FATHER IN LAW WILL LISTEN INTENTLY FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND THEN MOVE ON TO ANOTHER TOPIC  DESPITE MY HUSBAND BEING MIDSENTENCE WHILE THIS PATTERN SHOULD HAVE MADE MY HUSBAND MORE EMPATHETIC TO MY PLIGHT  WHAT BRUCES FATHER DOES TO HIM  HE DOES TO ME  IT HAS HAD THE OPPOSITE EFFECT  CONFIRMING FOR HIM THAT EVERYONE GETS INTERRUPTED  NO ONE GETS TO BE HEARD ALL THE TIME  EXCEPT BRATTY WOMEN WHO DEMAND IT WHICH BRINGS ME BACK TO ALEXA  SHE LISTENS BETTER THAN ANY PARTNER I HAVE EVER HAD  BUT THATS NOT HARD  BECAUSE I THOUGHT ALL OF THEM WERE POOR LISTENERS  ESPECIALLY THE ONE WHO WAS HEARING IMPAIRED  HE DIDNT HEAR A THING I SAID IT MADE ME WONDER  DO I SEEK OUT PARTNERS WHO DONT HEAR ME SO I CAN KEEP HAVING TO DEAL WITH MY PROBLEMATIC TERRITORY IN ORDER TO FIX IT  LIKE ONE MIGHT PRACTICE A SKATEBOARD JUMP OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNTIL HE MASTERS IT  OR WERE ALL MY PARTNERS PERFECT  MORE OR LESS  BUT BECAUSE OF MY WOUND  I WIND UP NOT FEELING HEARD  THAT IS  I COULD BE WITH THE BEST LISTENER ON EARTH AND I WOULD STILL FEEL UNHEARD I DECIDED TO ASK MY ELECTRONIC FRIEND ALEXA  DO WE LOOK FOR PARTNERS WHO DO THAT THING WE HATE SO WE CAN TRY TO FIX IT  OR DO WE  SHE INTERRUPTED ME MIDSENTENCE AND SAID  SORRY  I DONT KNOW THAT ONE SORRY  I DONT KNOW THAT ONE  AS IF I WERE ASKING HER TO IDENTIFY A SONG  IF SHE HAD LET ME GET MY WHOLE THOUGHT OUT  SHE MAY HAVE UNDERSTOOD WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT I KNEW IT WAS

FEWER THAN HALF AS MANY  WHICH IS A REFLECTION BOTH OF TEENAGERS DECREASING WORK FORCE PARTICIPATION AND OF THE EXPLOSIVE GROWTH IN RESTAURANTS BUT IN AN INDUSTRY WHERE CHEAP LABOR IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT IN PROVIDING INEXPENSIVE FOOD  A SHORTAGE OF WORKERS IS CHANGING THE EQUATION UPON WHICH FAST FOOD PLACES HAVE LONG RELIED  THIS CAN BE SEEN IN RISING WAGES  IN A GROWTH OF INCENTIVES  AND IN THE SOMETIMES ODD SITUATIONS THAT BUSINESS OWNERS FIND THEMSELVES IN THIS IS WHY JEFFREY KAPLOW  FOR EXAMPLE  SPENDS A LOT OF TIME WORKING BEHIND THE COUNTER IN HIS SUBWAY RESTAURANT IN LOWER

FRANCHISEES FOR REFERRALS  SEEKING TO HIRE PEOPLE FROM SUBWAYS THAT HAVE CLOSED YET THERE HE WAS DURING A RECENT LUNCHTIME RUSH  RINGING UP VEGGIE FOOTLONGS AND FOUNTAIN DRINKS  HE FEARED THAT IF THE LINE GREW TOO LONG  PEOPLE MIGHT GET FRUSTRATED AND NOT COME BACK EVERY TIME THERES A HUGE LINE  THE NEXT DAY THE STORE IS NOWHERE NEAR AS BUSY  HE EXPLAINED LATER AS HE STRAIGHTENED TABLES AND SWEPT UP CRUMBS ACROSS THE COUNTRY  KEITH MILLER  ANOTHER FRANCHISEE  IS DEALING WITH THE SAME PROBLEM  WHAT EMPLOYEES  WE DONT HAVE THEM ANYMORE  JOKED MR  MILLER  WHO CANT FIND ENOUGH WORKERS FOR THE THREE SUBWAYS HE OWNS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SINCE 2010  FAST FOOD JOBS HAVE GROWN NEARLY TWICE AS FAST AS EMPLOYMENT OVER ALL  CONTRIBUTING TO THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY  BUT RAPID GROWTH HAS CREATED NEW PROBLEMS  SOME SAY RESTAURANTS HAVE GROWN FASTER THAN DEMAND  CAUSING A GLUT OF COMPETITION THAT IS ANOTHER SOURCE OF PRESSURE ON BUSINESS OWNERS RESTAURANT OWNERS ARE ALSO WORRYING ABOUT INCREASED IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT  NEARLY 20 PERCENT OF WORKERS ARE FOREIGN BORN WITH UNEMPLOYMENT AT A 17 YEAR LOW  BUSINESSES EVERYWHERE ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND WORKERS  FAST FOOD IS FEELING THE PINCH ACUTELY  ESPECIALLY AS ONE IMPORTANT SOURCE OF WORKERS HAS DRIED UP  IN 2000  ABOUT 45 PERCENT OF THOSE BETWEEN 16 AND 19 HAD A JOB  TODAY ITS 30 PERCENT WE USED TO GET OVERWHELMED WITH THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WANTING SUMMER JOBS  MR  MILLER SAID  ADDING THAT HE NOW GETS MAYBE A HANDFUL OF SUCH APPLICATIONS  AT MOST  I DONT KNOW WHAT TEENAGERS DO ALL SUMMER GAVIN POOLE  A 17 YEAR OLD SENIOR AT MONTVILLE TOWNSHIP HIGH SCHOOL IN NEW JERSEY  LIKES THE IDEA OF BEING HIS OWN BOSS  THATS ONE REASON HE CREATED A SMALL BUSINESS OUT OF AFTER SCHOOL LANDSCAPING AND HANDYMAN WORK  THE MONEY HAS HELPED COVER HIS CELLPHONE BILL AND THE PAYMENTS ON THE JEEP WRANGLER HE LEASED LAST YEAR  I WANT TO BE PREPARED FOR THE FUTURE  BECAUSE YOU DONT KNOW  FINANCIALLY  WHAT SITUATION YOU COULD BE IN  HE SAID A RECENT ANALYSIS BY ECONOMISTS AT THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS FOUND THAT AN INCREASED EMPHASIS ON EDUCATION  AND GETTING SCHOLARSHIPS  HAD CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECLINE IN WORKING TEENAGERS  REFLECTING BOTH THE RISING COSTS OF EDUCATION AND THE LOW WAGES MOST PEOPLE THAT AGE CAN EARN NOW  AFTER YEARS OF BENEFITING FROM LOW COST LABOR  MANY EMPLOYERS ARE STARTING TO PAY MORE  FAST FOOD WAGES BEGAN RISING IN 2014  AND HAVE INCREASED FASTER THAN OVERALL WAGES SINCE  BUT AT  93 AN HOUR  THE PAY IS STILL LESS THAN HALF THE AVERAGE FOR AN HOURLY EMPLOYEE  PUSHING COMPANIES TO OFFER MORE INCENTIVES  LIKE DENTAL INSURANCE  SIGN UP BONUSES AND EVEN TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENT  TO ENTICE WORKERS THATS GOOD NEWS FOR WORKERS LIKE JUAN MORALES  WHO HAS ASSEMBLED SANDWICHES AT A SUBWAY ON STATEN ISLAND FOR MORE THAN 15 YEARS ITS MUCH BETTER THAN BEFORE  SAID MR  MORALES  WHO EARNS A LITTLE MORE THAN  AN HOUR  BUT FOR MY BOSS  I SEE THAT ITS HARDER RESTAURANTS ARE NOTORIOUS FOR CHURNING THROUGH EMPLOYEES  BUT PEOPLE ARE COMING AND GOING FASTER THAN THEY HAVE IN RECENT MEMORY  ACCORDING TO DATA FROM TDN2K  A RESTAURANT RESEARCH FIRM  LAST YEAR  THE TURNOVER RATE REACHED 133 PERCENT  MEANING THAT POSITIONS OFTEN HAD TO BE FILLED MORE THAN ONCE THAT HAS FORCED BUSINESS OWNERS TO ADJUST TAMRA KENNEDY  WHO OWNS NINE TACO JOHNS FRANCHISES IN THE MIDWEST  STARTED OFFERING  AS A BONUS TO NEW EMPLOYEES WHO REACHED 100 HOURS  SHE HAS STARTED OFFERING MERIT INCREASES TWICE A YEAR  AND SHE PAYS ALL EMPLOYEES MORE THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE HIRING HAS BEEN MORE CHALLENGING IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THAN PROBABLY THE PREVIOUS 10  MS  KENNEDY SAID ABOUT HALF OF HER STORES ARE UNDERSTAFFED  SO SHE HAS DEVISED WORKAROUNDS  DIGITAL PROBES  NOT PEOPLE  NOW RECORD FOOD TEMPERATURES  SHE HAS ALSO INVESTED IN EXPENSIVE NEW REGISTERS THAT CAN PRODUCE REPORTS THAT EMPLOYEES USED TO DO BY HAND IVE NEVER SEEN THE INDUSTRY IN THIS KIND OF SITUATION  SAID ROBERT S  GOLDIN  A PARTNER AT THE FOOD CONSULTING FIRM PENTALLECT  ITS NEVER BEEN LIKE THIS LABOR COSTS ARE RISING  ACCORDING TO AN ESTIMATE FROM DEAN HASKELL  A PARTNER AT NATIONAL RETAIL CONCEPT PARTNERS  A RESTAURANT AND RETAIL CONSULTING FIRM IN DENVER  MR  HASKELL ANALYZED PUBLIC FINANCIAL FILINGS FROM 15 MAJOR CHAINS AND DETERMINED THAT THOSE COMPANIES SPENT ABOUT  MILLION MORE ON LABOR LAST YEAR THAN THE YEAR BEFORE MCDONALDS HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL EXPAND ITS TUITION REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM  COMMITTING  MILLION OVER FIVE YEARS TO TUITION REIMBURSEMENT FOR EMPLOYEES WHO WORK AT ITS STORES FOR AT LEAST 90 DAYS  BEFORE  THE REQUIREMENT WAS NINE MONTHS THAT  MILLION MIGHT SEEM LIKE A LOT  BUT REPLACING WORKERS IS ALSO EXPENSIVE  IT COSTS ABOUT  000 TO REPLACE THE AVERAGE HOURLY RESTAURANT WORKER  ACCORDING TO DATA FROM TDN2K THIRTY YEARS AGO  I WOULD NOT PUT UP WITH THE STUFF I PUT UP WITH TODAY  SAID JOHN MOTTA  A LONGTIME DUNKIN DONUTS FRANCHISEE IN NASHUA  N H  WHEN AN EMPLOYEE RECENTLY MISSED A SHIFT  ONE OF HIS STORES COULD SERVE ONLY DRIVE THROUGH CUSTOMERS FOR ABOUT AN HOUR YOU TRY NOT TO BE TOO HARSH ON THEM  HE SAID  BECAUSE YOURE AFRAID TOMORROW THEYRE NOT GOING TO SHOW UP

20180503,business,money,8,A VIDEO OF THE RAPPER KANYE WEST DISCUSSING SLAVERY IS A SAD REMINDER OF AMERICAS HISTORICAL AMNESIA ABOUT THE BRUTAL REALITIES OF THAT INSTITUTION  WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT SLAVERY FOR 400 YEARS  HE SAID IN THE CLIP  WHICH WAS WIDELY CIRCULATED ON TWITTER  THAT SOUNDS LIKE A CHOICE MR  WEST SEEMED TO SUGGEST THAT ENSLAVED AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE SO CONTENT THAT THEY DID NOT ACTIVELY RESIST THEIR BONDAGE  AND  AS A RESULT  THEY BEAR SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR CENTURIES OF PERSECUTION HES NOT ALONE IN HIS THINKING  IN 2016  THE FORMER FOX NEWS HOST BILL OREILLY ASSERTED THAT SLAVES WERE WELL FED AND HAD DECENT LODGINGS  LAST SEPTEMBER  THE ALABAMA SENATORIAL CANDIDATE ROY MOORE DEEMED THE ANTEBELLUM ERA THE LAST GREAT PERIOD IN AMERICAN HISTORY  I THINK IT WAS GREAT AT THE TIME WHEN FAMILIES WERE UNITED  HE DECLARED  EVEN THOUGH WE HAD SLAVERY  THEY CARED FOR ONE ANOTHER MODERN SCHOLARSHIP HAS DEBUNKED SUCH WHITEWASHING  ACCURATELY DEPICTING SLAVERY AS AN INHUMANE INSTITUTION ROOTED IN GREED AND THE VIOLENT SUBJUGATION OF MILLIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS YET COUNTLESS AMERICANS HAVE NOT LEARNED THESE LESSONS  THEY CLING  INSTEAD  TO A ROMANTICIZED INTERPRETATION OF SLAVERY  ONE INDEBTED TO A BOOK PUBLISHED 100 YEARS AGO IN THE SPRING OF 1918  THE HISTORIAN ULRICH BONNELL PHILLIPS PUBLISHED HIS SEMINAL STUDY  AMERICAN NEGRO SLAVERY  WHICH FRAMED THE INSTITUTION AS A BENEVOLENT LABOR AGREEMENT BETWEEN INDULGENT MASTERS AND HAPPY SLAVES  NO OTHER BOOK  NO MONUMENT  NO MOVIE  SAVE  PERHAPS  FOR GONE WITH THE WIND  ITSELF BEHOLDEN TO PHILLIPSS WORK  HAS BEEN MORE INFLUENTIAL IN SHAPING HOW MANY AMERICANS HAVE VIEWED SLAVERY BORN IN 1877 INTO A GEORGIA FAMILY WITH PLANTER ROOTS  PHILLIPS DEVELOPED AN ABIDING SYMPATHY FOR THE OLD SOUTH  HE STUDIED HISTORY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA AND THEN AS A GRADUATE STUDENT AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY UNDER THE TUTELAGE OF WILLIAM A  DUNNING  A SCHOLAR WITH A PRO SOUTHERN BENT AFTER EARNING HIS DOCTORATE IN 1902  PHILLIPS SET OUT TO CORRECT THE SLANTED PICTURE OF THE SOUTHERN PAST THAT HE BELIEVED PREVAILED AT THE TIME  THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY BOSTON AND LARGELY BEEN WRITTEN WRONG  HE LAMENTED  IT MUST BE WRITTEN ANEW BEFORE IT REACHES ITS FINAL FORM OF TRUTH  AND FOR THAT WORK  THE SOUTH MUST DO ITS PART PHILLIPS CERTAINLY DID HIS  DURING HIS 30 YEAR CAREER  HE PUBLISHED NINE BOOKS AND CLOSE TO 60 ARTICLES  EARNING A SERIES OF PRESTIGIOUS PROFESSORSHIPS THAT CULMINATED IN A VERY FLOSSY JOB  AS HE PUT IT  AT YALE UNIVERSITY  THIS 1930 APPOINTMENT REFLECTED HIS STATURE AS THE COUNTRYS LEADING HISTORIAN OF SLAVERY AND THE SOUTH  AS WELL AS THE INFLUENCE OF HIS MOST IMPORTANT BOOK  AMERICAN NEGRO SLAVERY HE WAS A PRODIGIOUS  ALBEIT SELECTIVE RESEARCHER  PHILLIPS FOUND EVIDENCE IN PLANTATION RECORDS AND SOUTHERN TRAVELOGUES THAT BOLSTERED THE BOOKS BENIGN INTERPRETATION OF SLAVERY  WHILE DOWNPLAYING EVIDENCE THAT DID NOT  IN HIS HANDS  PLANTATIONS BECAME IDYLLIC SITES WHERE WHITE FAMILIES HAD MODELED THE HABITS OF CIVILIZED LIFE FOR THEIR CHILDLIKE BLACK CHARGES  THE PLANTATIONS  PHILLIPS WROTE  WERE THE BEST SCHOOLS YET INVENTED FOR THE MASS TRAINING OF THAT SORT OF INERT AND BACKWARD PEOPLE WHICH THE BULK OF THE AMERICAN NEGROES REPRESENTED ACCORDING TO PHILLIPS  SLAVEHOLDERS PROVIDED THE ENSLAVED WITH COMFORTABLE LIVING QUARTERS AND PLENTIFUL RATIONS AND ESCHEWED PHYSICAL DISCIPLINE  THEY RARELY SOLD SLAVES  ESPECIALLY IF IT MEANT BREAKING UP FAMILIES  SLAVE OWNERS RULE WAS BENEVOLENT IN INTENT AND BENEFICIAL IN EFFECT PHILLIPSS USE OF THE PASSIVE VOICE  IN MARCH THE CORN FIELDS WERE COMMONLY PLANTED  FURTHER DISTANCED THE READER FROM SLAVES COERCED LABOR  ENSLAVED AFRICAN AMERICANS  IN TURN  DISPLAYED GRATITUDE AND LOYALTY TO THEIR MASTERS  PHILLIPS CONCLUDED THAT  WHILE SLAVERY MAY HAVE BEEN ECONOMICALLY INEFFICIENT  THE RELATIONS ON BOTH SIDES WERE FELT TO BE BASED ON PLEASURABLE RESPONSIBILITY AMERICAN NEGRO SLAVERY WON WIDESPREAD ACCLAIM IN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH  REVIEWERS PRAISED PHILLIPS FOR HIS THOROUGH RESEARCH  CHARMING STYLE AND LACK OF BIAS  IN THE WORDS OF THE HISTORIAN JOHN DAVID SMITH  AN EXPERT ON PHILLIPS  THE BOOK SERVED AS THE DEFINITIVE ACCOUNT OF THE PECULIAR INSTITUTION FROM WORLD WAR I INTO THE 1950S THE BOOK SET THE TONE FOR THE TREATMENT OF SLAVERY IN CLASSROOMS AND TEXTBOOKS ACROSS THE COUNTRY  THERE WAS MUCH TO BE SAID FOR SLAVERY AS A TRANSITION STATUS BETWEEN BARBARISM AND CIVILIZATION  MAINTAINED A 1930 BEST SELLER  ECHOING PHILLIPS ALMOST VERBATIM  THE MAJORITY OF SLAVES WERE  APPARENTLY HAPPY FROM THE BEGINNING  HOWEVER  PHILLIPS HAD HIS CRITICS  WHO INSISTED ON TELLING A MORE TRUTHFUL  UNVARNISHED HISTORY OF SLAVERY  W E B  DU BOIS WROTE A SCATHING REVIEW OF AMERICAN NEGRO SLAVERY  OBSERVING  IT IS A DEFENSE OF AMERICAN SLAVERY  A DEFENSE OF AN INSTITUTION WHICH WAS AT BEST A MISTAKE AND AT WORST A CRIME  DRAWING ON INTERVIEWS WITH EX SLAVES  SOURCES PHILLIPS REJECTED  THE HISTORIAN FREDERIC BANCROFT PUBLISHED A 1931 BOOK THAT EXPLODED PHILLIPSS MISREPRESENTATIONS OF THE DOMESTIC SLAVE TRADE PHILLIPSS CRITICS GREW MORE VOCAL IN THE 1950S AND 1960S  AS A NEW GENERATION OF SCHOLARS CHALLENGED HIS BENIGN READING OF SLAVERY AND THE RACISM THAT STAINED ALMOST EVERY PAGE OF AMERICAN NEGRO SLAVERY YET WHILE PHILLIPSS MOST EGREGIOUS CLAIMS FELL OUT OF FAVOR  THE LEGACY OF AMERICAN NEGRO SLAVERY HAS PROVED TENACIOUS ACCORDING TO A NEW SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER REPORT ON HOW SLAVERY IS TAUGHT IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS  CURRENT PEDAGOGY CONTINUES TO FOCUS ON SLAVERY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF WHITES  NOT THE ENSLAVED  WHILE FAILING TO CONNECT THE INSTITUTION TO THE WHITE SUPREMACIST BELIEFS THAT SUPPORTED IT  TEXTBOOKS OFTEN IGNORE SLAVEHOLDERS DESIRE TO MAKE MONEY AND TOO EASILY SLIP INTO GRAMMATICAL CONSTRUCTIONS  AFRICANS WERE BROUGHT TO AMERICA  THAT ABSOLVE ENSLAVERS OF THEIR ACTIONS LAST YEAR  A CHARLOTTE  N C  TEACHER ASKED HER MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS TO LIST FOUR REASONS WHY AFRICANS MADE GOOD SLAVES  AN EIGHTH GRADE TEACHER IN SAN ANTONIO RECENTLY SENT STUDENTS HOME WITH A WORK SHEET TITLED THE LIFE OF SLAVES  A BALANCED VIEW  IT PROMPTED STUDENTS TO LIST THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF SLAVERY ALONG WITH THE NEGATIVE WE MUST CONFRONT MISCHARACTERIZATIONS OF THE NATURE OF SLAVERY  WHETHER NURTURED IN THE CLASSROOM OR BROADCAST ON TWITTER  AFTER ALL  HISTORICAL ACCURACY ON THIS TOPIC IS NOT JUST ABOUT GETTING THE PAST RIGHT  IT IS ALSO ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THE CHALLENGES OF THE PRESENT THE PERSISTENCE OF RACIAL INEQUALITY IN AMERICA  FROM POLICE BRUTALITY AND SCHOOL SEGREGATION TO MASS INCARCERATION AND WEALTH DISPARITIES  REFLECTS  TO SOME DEGREE  THE PERSISTENCE OF THE PHILLIPSIAN TAKE ON SLAVERY  IF THE INSTITUTION WERE LITTLE MORE THAN A FINISHING SCHOOL FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS  THEN WHY ACKNOWLEDGE OR ADDRESS ITS PERNICIOUS LEGACIES TODAY

 CHUCK HAD OPENED THAT MEETING BY PROFFERING AN INCRIMINATING SLIDE THAT CONNECTED BOBBY TO THE SABOTAGE OF THE ICE JUICE I P O  RATHER THAN BY PLANTING IT IN THE BILLIONAIRES APARTMENT  NEVERTHELESS  THIS WEEKS EPISODE BEGINS AS CHUCK CONFERS WITH DR  ARI GILBERT  THE MAN WHO GAVE HIM THE SLIDE  TALKING AS IF THE PLAN TO HIDE IT AT AXES PLACE IS STILL IN FULL EFFECT COMPARING HIMSELF AND THE DOCTOR TO WORLD WAR II PARATROOPERS  CHUCK SAYS THEYVE REACHED THE POINT OF NO RETURN  CAN THE DOCTORS CONSCIENCE HOLD UP  IN CHUCKS WORDS  TO FRAMING SOMEONE  EVEN IF THAT PERSON IS  IN FACT  GUILTY  I CAN LIVE WITH IT  GILBERT REPLIES  COMPARING THE SCHEME TO PERFORMING TRIAGE IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM AFTER A DISASTER  YOU SAVE WHO YOU CAN  AND FORCE THE FATE OF THE REST OUT OF YOUR MIND I HOPED YOUD SEE IT THAT WAY  CHUCK REPLIES WHAT FOLLOWS IS  WELL  ITS A LOT OF THINGS  BUT AMONG THOSE THINGS IS THE SYSTEMATIC DEMOLITION OF DR  GILBERTS LIFE  THIS TAKES PLACE ACCORDING THE EXACT SAME MORAL CALCULUS HE SIGNED UP FOR WHEN HE  AND WE  STILL THOUGHT HE WAS MERELY RE ARTICULATING HIS WILLINGNESS TO FRAME AXE  BILLIONS BEING BILLIONS  THAT CONVERSATION BEARS ALL THE SIGNS OF A RED HERRING  BUT IN THIS WORLD OF CONSTANTLY SHIFTING LOYALTIES  ITS STILL IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW AT THIS POINT WHOS THE HUSTLER AND WHOS THE MARK THE CLUES QUICKLY MOUNT  AS THE PLOT RETURNS TO WHERE WE LEFT OFF  AT THE THREE PERSON CONCLAVE IN AXES APARTMENT   ARE WE JUMPING BACK OR JUMPING FORWARD  THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION WILL UNLOCK MUCH OF WHAT FOLLOWS  BOBBY  WENDY AND CHUCK AGREE THERE THAT  IN ORDER TO

MATERIAL THAT COULD BE ICKY OR CAMPY IN OTHER HANDS  WENDYS RELENTLESS ATTRACTIVENESS  AND THE DIFFERENTIAL OF DESIRE BETWEEN THE TWO CHARACTERS  YIELDS THE SEXIEST SCENE IVE SEEN ON TV ALL YEAR  WITH NO NUDITY AND LITTLE MORE PHYSICAL CONTACT THAN A STRATEGICALLY DEPLOYED HEAD ON HIS SHOULDER  AND YET YOU FEEL WENDYS DESPERATION  EVEN AS SHE FEIGNS CONFIDENCE  SHE HAS ALREADY BEEN DRESSED DOWN BY TAYLOR IN A POWERFUL CONFRONTATION OVER HER MOTIVES REGARDING MAFEE  AND SHE VISIBLY CARRIES THE WEIGHT OF TAYLORS ACCUSATIONS  EVEN AS SHE ASKS HIM IF SHE CAN CALL HIM DUDLEY THE FINAL PIECE OF THE PUZZLE IS CHUCK  RHOADES CONSTRUCTS A VERITABLE MATRYOSHKA DOLL OF PATSIES  USING EVERY OUNCE OF HIS LEGAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ACUMEN  THE FIRST IS DR  GILBERT  WHOM HE CONVINCES TO COP A PLEA  THE OPENING SCENE  WE LEARN  WAS A FLASH FORWARD  A CONVERSATION INITIATED BY RHOADES IN ORDER TO DISTRACT DR  GILBERT WHILE THE NOTORIOUS SLIDE WAS PLANTED BACK IN THE DOCTORS FRIDGE  COMBINED WITH THE PHONY TRADE RECORD WHIPPED UP BY AXES TEAM  IT MAKES FOR AN AIRTIGHT AND TOTALLY FRAUDULENT CASE  THE DOCTOR IS TOAST AND YET  CHUCKS SPEECHES TO DR  GILBERT ABOUT GUILT AS A STATE OF BEING  IF NOT AS

20180504,business,market,10,THE PETITION IS UP AND THE TWITTERATI ARE AWAKE  THIS WEEK ADIDAS BECAME THE LATEST APPAREL BRAND TO COME UNDER FIRE FOR WHAT A CELEBRITY COLLABORATOR SAID  AFTER KANYE WEST GAVE AN INTERVIEW TO TMZ IN WHICH HE SAID HE THOUGHT 400 YEARS OF SLAVERY SOUNDS LIKE A CHOICE THE INTERNET CLUTCHED ITS COLLECTIVE BOSOM AND BEGAN TO ROAR HE TRIED TO WALK IT BACK  OR AT LEAST EXPLAIN ON SOCIAL MEDIA WHAT HE REALLY MEANT  BUT THE DAMAGE HAD BEEN DONE  AMID THE TORRENT OF WORDS AND CONTROVERSIAL STATEMENTS THAT HAVE SPEWED FORTH FROM THE VOLCANO OF HIS MOUTH AND MIND RECENTLY  AND THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT  STARTING WITH THE TRUMP LOVE  THIS WAS THE PART THAT THE SELF APPOINTED CONSUMER WATCHDOGS OF THE DIGITAL WORLD COULD NOT COUNTENANCE  AS THEY DID WHENEVER THEY FELT A BRAND HAS MADE A MISTAKE  WHETHER WITH A PRODUCT  H M AND ITS MONKEY HOODIE  OR A STATEMENT  LAURA INGRAHAM AND HER COMMENTS ON A PARKLAND SURVIVOR  OR A VIDEO  PEWDIEPIE  THEY MADE THEIR DISPLEASURE KNOWN BUT THIS TIME AROUND ADIDAS HASNT DONE WHAT PRETTY MUCH EVERY OTHER BIG BRAND HAS DONE UNTIL NOW  APOLOGIZE AND CUT OFF THE OFFENDING LIMB  OR AT LEAST IT HASNT YET HOW COME KASPER RORSTED  THE BRANDS CHIEF EXECUTIVE  HAS REPEATEDLY SAID THAT WHILE HE DOESNT SUPPORT MR  WESTS COMMENTS  THEY ARE MR  WESTS COMMENTS  AND THOUGH ADIDASS POSITION ON HUMAN RIGHTS WAS PUBLIC AND FIRM  AND NOT IN ALIGNMENT WITH MR  WESTS STATEMENT  HE WAS NOT GOING TO COMMENT FURTHER ON MR  WEST  MR  RORSTED ALSO WENT ON TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MR  WEST  ALONG WITH OTHER ADIDAS COLLABORATORS SUCH AS PHARRELL WILLIAMS AND STELLA MCCARTNEY  WAS A BIG HELP IN THE BRANDS COMEBACK IN THE UNITED STATES MAYBE THATS PART OF IT  AND MAYBE ADIDAS  NOT BEING AN AMERICAN COMPANY  DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE FREIGHTED  PAINFUL NATURE OF MR  WESTS REMARKS  THOUGH PRESUMABLY THEIR LOCAL TEAM DOES  BUT I WOULD GUESS THERES SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON  TOO  THINK ABOUT IT  COULD ADIDAS REALLY NOT HAVE ANTICIPATED THE LIKELIHOOD OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENING WHEN THEY SIGNED MR  WEST LO  THOSE MANY MOONS AGO  IN 2013  NOT  TO BE SURE  THE SLAVERY COMMENTS EXACTLY  BUT SOMETHING THAT WOULD UPSET OR ALIENATE A LARGE CHUNK OF THE CONSUMER POPULATION  SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE SO OFFENSIVE TO A MEANINGFUL GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT IT WOULD BECOME A DEBATING POINT ACROSS THE PUBLIC CONVERSATION ITS HARD TO IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE THAT SCENARIO HADNT COME UP  CONTROVERSY AND LOOSE CANNON ISM  SPEAKING OFF THE CUFF AND WITHOUT A FILTER  OR SEEMINGLY ANY REAL FORETHOUGHT  HAS ALWAYS BEEN PART OF THE KANYE WEST BRAND  PART OF HIS APPEAL AND EXTRAORDINARY HUBRIS AND THE MAGNET DRAW THAT IS A COMBINATION OF GREAT TALENT AND THE CONSTANT THREAT OF A TRAIN WRECK  HES ENDLESSLY SAYING THE THINGS OTHER PEOPLE COULD NEVER EVEN IMAGINE THINKING  YOU NEVER REALLY KNOW WHAT BIZARRO THING IS GOING TO COME OUT OF HIS MOUTH  OR FINGERS  NEXT  IT IS THE BEDROCK ON WHICH PART OF HIS REPUTATION RESTS  ITS NOT A SECRET  ITS ADDICTIVE  THAT S WHAT HE DOES  HE GOES TOO FAR UNLIKE  SAY  SUCH SPOKESPEOPLE THAT WENT WRONG AS RYAN LOCHTE  WHO WAS DROPPED BY SPEEDO AND POLO RALPH LAUREN AFTER THE SWIMMER ADMITTED HE LIED ABOUT BEING ROBBED DURING THE RIO OLYMPICS  OR MARIA SHARAPOVA  WHOSE DEALS WITH NIKE AND PORSCHE WERE SUSPENDED AFTER SHE FAILED A DRUG TEST  THEY LATER RENEWED THEIR AGREEMENTS  MR  WEST NEVER PRETENDED TO BE OTHER THAN WHAT HE WAS  SOMEONE WHO COULD NOT  AS HE TWEETED RECENTLY  BE MANAGED  ADIDAS COULDNT ARGUE  NONE OF US CAN  THAT IT WAS SUCKERED INTO THINKING HE STOOD FOR A POLITICALLY CORRECT  MODERN MORALISTIC APPROACH TO THE WORLD  THIS IS NOT TO DEFEND OR EXCUSE WHAT HE SAID  IT WAS REPREHENSIBLE  BUT IT WAS ALSO  AT AN ABSTRACT LEVEL  IN CHARACTER WHEN ADIDAS HIRED MR  WEST  AFTER ALL  HE HAD ALREADY JUMPED ONSTAGE AT THE 2009 MTV VIDEO AWARDS TO ANNOUNCE TAYLOR SWIFT DID NOT DESERVE THE BEST FEMALE VIDEO AWARD AND IT SHOULD HAVE GONE TO BEYONC  HE WAS ENGAGED IN SOMETHING OF A PUBLIC WAR WITH HIS PREVIOUS SNEAKER PARTNER  NIKE  HE EVENTUALLY WROTE A SONG ABOUT IT  HE WASNT CROCHETING LACE DOILIES FOR THE SOFA  ADIDAS KNEW WHAT IT WAS GETTING INTO  THE BRAND HIRED HIM BECAUSE OF HIS ABILITY TO DRAW ATTENTION AND INCITE EMOTIONS  NOT IN SPITE OF IT  IT WASNT  LETS BE HONEST  AND WHATEVER HE MAY CLAIM  BECAUSE HES SUCH A GENIUS SNEAKER DESIGNER UNLIKE HIS MUSIC  THERES NOTHING GROUNDBREAKING OR INDUSTRY SHIFTING ABOUT MR  WESTS APPAREL OR HIS FOOTWEAR  THEY DONT STAND ON THEIR OWN  THE CONTENT OF THE CLOTHING IS HIM  HIS EGO  THE ONE THAT ALLOWED HIM TO HAVE A FASHION SHOW IN MADISON SQUARE GARDEN AND CLAIM HE SHOULD BE DESIGNING FOR HERMS  AND HIS MESSIANIC SENSE OF SELF FILLS THE PRODUCT WITH MEANING FOR HIS CONSUMERS  AND THEY BUY IT IN SELL OUT NUMBERS  HES RIGHT ABOUT THAT OR UPSETS HIS CONSUMERS  WHICH SOMETIMES IN MR  WESTS CASE CAN SEEM LIKE ONE AND THE SAME  IT WOULD BE HYPOCRITICAL IF ADIDAS WERE TO DROP HIM NOW  ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN ANOTHER OUT OF CONTROL TWEETER IS SETTING THE NATIONAL AGENDA  DROPPING HIM MIGHT IN THE END DO MORE DAMAGE TO THE COMPANYS REPUTATION THAN IF IT GIVES INTO PUBLIC PRESSURE  ITS POSSIBLE THIS POSITION COULD SHIFT  ITS POSSIBLE MR  WEST COULD DOUBLE DOWN TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT WOULD BE UNTENABLE FOR THE RELATIONSHIP TO CONTINUE  AND ADIDAS HAS PUNISHED HIM A LITTLE  CONTRARY TO MR  WESTS CLAIMS THAT HE IS THE BIGGEST THING TO HIT THE SNEAKER MARKET SINCE MAN WAS CREATED  MR  RORSTED TOLD CNBC THAT THE YEEZY BRAND HAS BEEN IMPORTANT TO ADIDAS BUT IT IS A SMALL PART OF THE  BILLION COMPANY  SMALL  THATS GOT TO HURT BESIDES  IF CONSUMERS REALLY WANT ADIDAS TO CUT TIES WITH KANYE  ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS STOP BUYING THE PRODUCT AND MAKE IT AN EVEN SMALLER PART  THATS THE REAL WAY TO EFFECT CHANGE IN A COMPANY THAT IS RELIANT ON PURCHASING BUT  AS OF FRIDAY MORNING  THERE WERE 13 407 SIGNATURES ON THIS DROP KANYE PETITION  MR  WEST HAS 28 2 MILLION TWITTER FOLLOWERS  YOU DO THE

20180507,business,business,3,BAGHDAD  FEW OUTSIDE IRAQ KNEW THE NAME HAIDER AL ABADI IN 2014 WHEN HE WAS PLUCKED FROM RELATIVE OBSCURITY TO LEAD A NATION IN CHAOS A COMPROMISE CANDIDATE FLOATED AFTER HIS PREDECESSOR NURI AL MALIKI WAS SIDELINED IN A POWER STRUGGLE  ABADI BECAME PRIME MINISTER IN SEPTEMBER THAT YEAR  TWO MONTHS AFTER ISLAMIC STATE RAN RAMPANT ACROSS IRAQ AND DECLARED ITS SO CALLED CALIPHATE FOUR YEARS ON  ABADI HAS DEFIED THE EXPECTATIONS OF AN ARMY OF SCEPTICS  HE HAS DECLARED VICTORY OVER ISLAMIC STATE  DIFFUSED SECTARIAN TENSIONS FANNED BY MALIKI  THAWED FROSTY RELATIONS WITH SUNNI ARAB NEIGHBOURS  AND MAINTAINED IRAQ S FRAGILE UNITY IN THE FACE OF AN ILL FATED KURDISH BID FOR INDEPENDENCE ABADI HAS ALSO BALANCED THE COMPETING AND COLLIDING INTERESTS OF HIS TWO MAIN BACKERS  IRAN AND THE UNITED STATES  A FORMER ELECTRICAL ENGINEER ONCE IN CHARGE OF SERVICING BBC ELEVATORS DURING YEARS OF VOLUNTARY EXILE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM  ABADI IS BANKING ON HIS ACHIEVEMENTS IN OFFICE TO WIN A SECOND TERM AT MAY 12 ELECTIONS  BUT VICTORY IS FAR FROM CERTAIN  LIKE ALL IRAQI PRIME MINISTERS SINCE SADDAM HUSSEIN S FALL IN 2003  ABADI  66  BELONGS TO THE COUNTRY S SHI ITE ARAB MAJORITY  BUT THIS YEAR THE SHI ITE VOTE  TYPICALLY ENOUGH TO PRODUCE A CLEAR VICTOR WHO CAN CLAIM THE RIGHT TO FORM A GOVERNING COALITION  IS SPLIT BESIDES MALIKI  WHO APPEALS TO SHI ITES WARY OF POWER SHARING WITH MINORITY SUNNIS AND KURDS  ABADI IS ALSO UP AGAINST HADI AL AMIRI  A MILITARY COMMANDER SEEN AS A WAR HERO FOR HELPING DEFEAT ISLAMIC STATE KNOWING HE CANNOT RELY ON SHI ITE VOTES ALONE  ABADI IS LOOKING TO DRAW UPON A WIDER VOTER BASE  HE HAS BEEN CAMPAIGNING THROUGHOUT IRAQ WITH HIS CROSS SECTARIAN  VICTORY ALLIANCE  LIST  THE ONLY ONE TO RUN IN EACH OF IRAQ S 18 PROVINCES BADR AL FAHL  A SUNNI LAWMAKER FROM SALAHUDDIN PROVINCE SEEKING HIS FOURTH TERM IN PARLIAMENT  SAID HE CHOSE TO RUN ON ABADI S LIST BECAUSE IT WAS CROSS SECTARIAN AND INCLUSIVE THIS IS THE FIRST LIST SINCE 2003 TO RUN IN ALL 18 PROVINCES WITH SUNNI  SHI ITE  KURDISH  CHRISTIAN AND YAZIDI CANDIDATES  HE TOLD REUTERS AT THE VICTORY ALLIANCE HEADQUARTERS IN TIKRIT   ABADI DOES NOT USE SECTARIAN RHETORIC AND WANTS TO BUILD THE COUNTRY  THE NEXT PHASE IS ALL ABOUT RECONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING FAHL SAID ABADI HAD GIVEN POLITICAL ALLIES IN SUNNI PROVINCES COMPLETE FREEDOM OVER SELECTING THE CANDIDATES ON HIS LIST  IN SALAHUDDIN  FOR EXAMPLE  THE VICTORY LIST IS ALL SUNNI  VICTORY NARRATIVEABADI EVEN WENT ON A RARE TOUR OF KURDISH PROVINCES LAST MONTH ALTHOUGH FEW RATE HIS CHANCES HIGHLY OF RECRUITING KURDS  WHO ARE STILL SEETHING OVER HIS CRACKDOWN ON THE SEMI AUTONOMOUS REGION AFTER SEPTEMBER S INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM MANY OF IRAQ S SUNNI ARABS ALSO FEEL LINGERING RESENTMENT TOWARDS THE SHI ITE LED GOVERNMENT FOLLOWING THE WAR AND DEVASTATION THAT MOSTLY HIT THEIR AREAS WITH THE ADVENT OF ISLAMIC STATE SO WHILE MANY PREFER ABADI TO OTHER SHI ITE POLITICIANS BECAUSE HE HAS SIGNALLED A MOVE AWAY FROM SECTARIANISM  THAT MAY NOT NECESSARILY TRANSLATE INTO VOTES FOR HIS CANDIDATES ABADI ALSO FACES CRITICISM ABOUT PERSISTENT CORRUPTION  TOUGH ECONOMIC CONDITIONS EXACERBATED BY FIGHTING AND THE AUSTERITY MEASURES HIS CABINET INTRODUCED  AS WELL AS HIS PRO BUSINESS STANCE IN A COUNTRY WHERE MOST PEOPLE ARE STATE EMPLOYEES AND DISTRUST THE PRIVATE SECTOR ABADI IS A CULTURED MAN AND A CONCILIATORY POLITICIAN  BUT HE ALSO BROUGHT US AUSTERITY  SAID MOHAMED GHADBAN  A STUDENT IN THE SHI ITE HOLY CITY OF NAJAF  MINDFUL OF THIS WEAKNESS  THE PRIME MINISTER S CAMPAIGN NARRATIVE HAS ALSO FOCUSED ON THE DEFEATOF ISLAMIC STATE ABADI DECLARED VICTORY IN DECEMBER AFTER A BRUTAL THREE YEAR CAMPAIGN TO FREE IRAQ FROM THE ISLAMIST MILITANTS WHO AT ONE POINT CONTROLLED A THIRD OF THE COUNTRY  TO DO SO  HE OVERSAW SIMULTANEOUS AND CONFLICTING SUPPORT FROM THE UNITED STATES AND IRAN  EACH AWKWARDLY SIDESTEPPING THE OTHER IN THE WIDENING REGIONAL CONFLICT TO DEFEAT IS AS THE U S LED COALITION FOCUSED ON REBUILDING AND TRAINING THE DEPLETED IRAQI SECURITY FORCES WHILE LAUNCHING NEAR DAILY AIR STRIKES  IRAN BACKED SHI ITE MILITIAS WERE EMBEDDING DEEPER INTO THE FABRIC OF IRAQ S SOCIETY AND STATE APPARATUS WHILE PROVIDING VITAL MILITARY SUPPORT TO GOVERNMENT FORCES  ABADI S DEFT JUGGLING OF IRAN AND THE UNITED STATES AMID ESCALATING TENSIONS OVER THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL  HAS MADE HIM THE PREFERRED CANDIDATE FOR WESTERN ALLIES  WHO HAVE LITTLE TO SHOW SINCE INVADING IRAQ 15 YEARS AGO BEYOND VIOLENCE  ENDEMIC CORRUPTION AND DEFECTIVE STATE INSTITUTIONS  ABADI HAS ALSO GAINED PRAISE FOR COURTING IRAQ S SUNNI ARAB NEIGHBOURS  A STRATEGY DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED BY MALIKI  RESPECT NOT ENTHUSIASMTHOUGH ABADI S SUPPORTERS AND FOES AGREE HE IS NOT A NATURAL POLITICIAN  THEY SAY HE HAS GROWN IN CONFIDENCE SINCE HIS NERVOUS START FOUR YEARS AGO  HOWEVER  HE IS SEEN AS AN INDECISIVE LEADER  PREFERRING TO DELIBERATE AT LENGTH WITH ADVISERS AND LAWMAKERS THREE WESTERN DIPLOMATS IN BAGHDAD SAID THEIR GOVERNMENTS WOULD FIND ABADI THE EASIEST CANDIDATE TO WORK WITH BUT THAT VERY PLIABILITY IS SEEN AS A WEAKNESS BY SOME CONSTITUENTS WHO CONSIDER HIM A FOREIGN STOOGE ABADI IS A DECENT MAN  BUT HE S NOT IN CONTROL OF HIS OWN CHOICES  SAID FALAH ABDULLAH  A 65 YEAR OLD RETIRED POLICE OFFICER IN QAYYARAH  60 KM  40 MILES  SOUTH OF MOSUL   HE ALTERNATES BETWEEN WHAT IRAN WANTS AND WHAT AMERICA WANTS  THIS HAS MUCH TO DO WITH HIS PREDECESSOR S LEGACY  A POLARISING FIGURE  MALIKI S SPECTRE LOOMS LARGE IN THE 2018 ELECTION  PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE SPLIT IN THE SHI ITE VOTE DESPITE MANY BLAMING HIM FOR LOSING SWATHES OF TERRITORY TO ISLAMIC STATE AND INSTITUTIONALISING CORRUPTION IN IRAQ S BLOATED MINISTRIES  MALIKI IS STILL SEEN BY HIS CONSIDERABLE BASE OF SUPPORTERS AS A STRONG LEADER WHO STOOD UP TO THE WEST AND DEFENDS SHI ITE INTERESTS ABADI ALSO FACES STIFF COMPETITION FROM AMIRI  THE LEADER OF THE BADR ORGANISATION  IRAQ S BIGGEST IRANIAN BACKED SHI ITE MILITIA  WHO IS ALSO CAMPAIGNING ON A VICTORY NARRATIVE AMIRI WAS COMMANDER OF THE POPULAR MOBILISATION FORCES  A COALITION OF IRANIAN BACKED MILITIAS THAT PLAYED A LARGE ROLE IN DEFEATING ISLAMIC STATE AFTER A CALL TO ARMS BY IRAQ S MOST REVERED SHI ITE CLERIC  GRAND AYATOLLAH ALI AL SISTANI WHILE ABADI IS RESPECTED BY MANY IRAQIS  SOMETHING FEW IN THE COUNTRY S POLITICAL ELITE CAN CLAIM  A VICTORY NARRATIVE CAN ONLY CARRY HIM SO FAR  EVEN SOME WHO PLAN TO VOTE FOR ABADI SAY THEY RE DOING IT OUT OF PRAGMATISM RATHER THAN ENTHUSIASM ABADI IS THE LEAST TERRIBLE OPTION  I WANT HIM

20180501,business,money,7,MUSEUMS HAVE LONG CONSIDERED THEMSELVES ABOVE THE FRAY OF THE POLITICAL  BUT THE PAST 18 MONTHS HAVE BROUGHT UNEXPECTED CHALLENGES  AND LEADERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE BEING CONFRONTED WITH AN URGENT QUESTION  HOW DO MUSEUMS RECONCEIVE THEIR MISSIONS AT A TIME OF GREAT SOCIETAL RECKONING AROUND RACE AND GENDER  AND AS MORE DIVERSE AUDIENCES DEMAND A VOICE AND A SENSE OF ACCOUNTABILITY AS DIRECTOR OF THE WALKER ART CENTER  IN MINNEAPOLIS  I FACED THIS CHALLENGE IN 2017 AFTER A CONTROVERSY OVER THE PLACEMENT OF A PUBLIC SCULPTURE  SCAFFOLD  BY SAM DURANT  THE WORK  FIRST EXHIBITED IN EUROPE IN 2012  DEPICTED GALLOWS THAT REPRESENTED SEVEN STATE SANCTIONED EXECUTIONS BETWEEN 1859 AND 2006  IT WAS INTENDED TO CRITIQUE THE PERSISTENCE OF THE DEATH PENALTY IN OURSE IF THE OLD HIERARCHIES THAT PLACED A MUSEUMS AUTHORITY ABOVE ITS PUBLICS FEELINGS HAD BEEN IN CHARGE IT IS NOT EASY TO ACKNOWLEDGE ONES BLIND SPOTS  WHAT I HAD HOPED WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION AND TRUTH TO POWER IN THE PRESENTATION OF SCAFFOLD WAS SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUING HISTORICAL TRAUMA ABOUT AN UNRECKONED WITH COLONIAL PAST  THIS WAS A HUMBLING PUBLIC ADMISSION FOR A PERSON WHOSE CAREER HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO PROVIDING A PLATFORM FOR UNDERREPRESENTED HISTORIES WHILE I AM NO LONGER A MUSEUM DIRECTOR  I BELIEVE THAT MUSEUMS MUST EMBRACE THIS FORM OF DIALOGUE IF THEY ARE TO REMAIN RELEVANT  TO DO SO REQUIRES RADICALLY DIFFERENT MODELS OF LEADERSHIP THAN WEVE HAD UNTIL NOW  YET IT IS HARD TO RESIST ENTRENCHMENT  AND DIFFICULT TO TAKE A RISK  IT IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO FAIL  BUT I BELIEVE THAT PROCEEDING WITH EMPATHY AND HUMILITY ARE WORTH EVERYTHING WE HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE  IN THE 1980S  DURING THE REAGAN PRESIDENCY AND THE AIDS CRISIS  CULTURE WARS OVER ARTISTIC CENSORSHIP RAGED  I WAS COMING OF AGE AS A CUBAN AMERICAN IN AN ERA OF INSTITUTIONAL CRITIQUE  IN MY FIRST CURATORIAL JOBS  I FOUGHT ALONG WITH OTHERS TO PRESENT ART THAT EXPOSED THE UNDERLYING POWER STRUCTURES OF WHITE ESTABLISHMENT CULTURE  CORPORATE AMERICA AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  BUT THESE EFFORTS FAILED TO EFFECT LASTING CHANGE THIRTY YEARS LATER  WE ARE FIGHTING THE SAME CULTURAL BATTLES  AND THE CURATORS WHO EMERGED THEN ARE TODAYS BESIEGED LEADERS  DESPITE BEST EFFORTS TO MAKE MEANINGFUL CHANGE  EXPONENTIAL GAPS REMAIN BETWEEN THE GROWING MINORITY MAJORITY AMERICAN POPULATION AND THOSE WHO LEAD  SUPPORT  ATTEND OR ARE EMPLOYED BY ART MUSEUMS  WEALTH DISPARITY AND THE SHIFTING VALUES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF MUSEUM DONORS ARE ALSO FACTORS THE SURGING COMMERCIAL ART MARKET HAS BECOME ANOTHER COLONIZING FORCE  EVEN AS IT HAS OPENED NEW ECONOMIES FOR ARTISTS OF COLOR  THERE ARE NOW TWO INCOMPATIBLE ART WORLDS  ONE COMMITTED TO INCLUSION  ARTISTIC FREEDOM AND CHANGE  THE OTHER DRIVEN BY MONEY AND ENTITLEMENTS  WHEN AGENDAS COLLIDE  THERE ARE CASUALTIES  MAJOR MUSEUMS WITH RECENT LEADERSHIP TURNOVERS  APART FROM THE WALKER  INCLUDE THE MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART IN LOS ANGELES AND THE QUEENS MUSEUM IN NEW YORK  WHERE DIRECTORS AND CURATORS  ALL OF THEM WOMEN  HAVE STEPPED DOWN BREAKTHROUGH ACTIONS ARE REQUIRED IN THIS ERA OF RECKONING AND ACCOUNTABILITY  SUSAN GOLDBERG  NATIONAL GEOGRAPHICS FIRST FEMALE EDITOR IN CHIEF  SET A COURAGEOUS EXAMPLE  FOR HER APRIL 2018 ISSUE  SHE COMMISSIONED AN OUTSIDE ASSESSMENT OF THE MAGAZINES TREATMENT OF RACE THROUGHOUT ITS HISTORY  SHE DISCOVERED THAT UNTIL 1970  IT DID LITTLE TO PUSH ITS READERS BEYOND THE STEREOTYPES INGRAINED IN WHITE AMERICAN CULTURE  RATHER THAN MINIMIZE HER INSTITUTIONS HISTORY  MS  GOLDBERG ADDRESSED IT THE EXHIBITION AMERICANS  DEVELOPED BY THE NOTED COMANCHE CURATOR PAUL CHAAT SMITH AT THE SMITHSONIANS NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN  CONFRONTS THE RACISM INHERENT IN THE CELEBRATION OF THANKSGIVING AND THE NAMING OF CERTAIN SPORTS TEAMS  IT DOES SO IN THE NATIONS CAPITAL WITH DIRECTNESS  HONESTY AND HUMOR  ITS SUCCESS POINTS TO THE RECOGNITION  BY MAJOR  PREDOMINANTLY WHITE RUN INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE SMITHSONIAN  OF THE NEED TO ELEVATE ALTERNATIVE PERSPECTIVES THAT DISRUPT MAINSTREAM UNDERSTANDING INDIVIDUAL ARTISTS HAVE ALSO TAKEN BOLD STEPS TO CHALLENGE INSTITUTIONAL STATUS QUO  WHEN MARK GROTJAHN RELINQUISHED A PRESTIGIOUS ARTIST AWARD AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE PRIZE HAD BEEN BESTOWED UPON TOO MANY WHITE MALE ARTISTS BEFORE HIM  MANY WERE STARTLED  SAM DURANTS CONCESSION OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO THE DAKOTA PEOPLE ALSO DEMONSTRATED AN UNPRECEDENTED WILLINGNESS TO LISTEN AND SEEK EARNEST RECONCILIATION SYSTEMIC CHANGE TAKES TIME  VISION AND NUANCED LEADERSHIP AT EVERY LEVEL  MOST ESPECIALLY AMONG DONORS AND MUSEUM BOARDS  SELFLESS INVESTMENT AND FORTITUDE ARE REQUIRED  SO IS A WILLINGNESS TO ENDURE DISCOMFORT  TO MOVE FORWARD  THE ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM MUST DEVOTE ITSELF TO A LONGER GAME ART CAN ILLUMINATE THE FISSURES IN SOCIETY AND IN RETURN OFFER OPPORTUNITIES FOR HEALING  BUT SHOULD ARTISTS BE THE ONLY ONES TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF THIS RESPONSIBILITY  IF MUSEUMS WANT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A PLACE  THEY MUST STOP SEEING ACTIVISTS AS ANTAGONISTS  THEY MUST POSITION THEMSELVES AS LEARNING COMMUNITIES  NOT IMPENETRABLE CENTERS OF SELF VALIDATING AUTHORITY IF THEY DO NOT  MUSEUMS RUN THE RISK OF BECOMING CULTURALLY IRRELEVANT ARTIFACTS  NOW IS THE TIME TO BE OPEN TO RADICAL CHANGE  THE NEXT WAVE OF DECOLONIZING AMERICAS ART MUSEUMS MUST SUCCEED  BECAUSE TO LOSE OUR CAPACITY FOR EMPATHY IN A DEMOCRACY IS NOT AN OPTION

HE ISN T STAYING ON AS DETROIT S COACH  EITHER VAN GUNDY HELD BOTH THOSE ROLES FOR FOUR YEARS  AND AT TIMES THE PISTONS SEEMED TO BE MAKING PROGRESS  BUT THEY MADE THE PLAYOFFS ONLY ONCE DURING HIS TENURE  IN 2016  AND THE TEAM ANNOUNCED HIS DEPARTURE MONDAY  OWNER TOM GORES SAID IT WAS A DIFFICULT DECISION I AM GRATEFUL TO STAN FOR EVERYTHING HE S DONE FOR THE PISTONS AND FOR THE CITY OF DETROIT  GORES SAID   HE REBUILT THE CULTURE OF OUR BASKETBALL TEAM  RE INSTILLED A WINNING ATTITUDE AND WORK ETHIC  AND TOOK US TO THE PLAYOFFS TWO YEARS AGO  HE WENT ALL IN FROM DAY ONE TO POSITIVELY IMPACT THIS FRANCHISE AND THIS COMMUNITY BUT OVER THE PAST TWO SEASONS OUR TEAM HAS NOT PROGRESSED  AND WE DECIDED THAT A CHANGE IS NECESSARY TO REGAIN OUR MOMENTUM  GORES SAID THE PISTONS WENT 39 43 THIS SEASON  MISSING THE PLAYOFFS FOR THE THIRD TIME IN FOUR YEARS UNDER VAN GUNDY  THEY VE MADE THE POSTSEASON JUST ONCE IN THE PAST NINE SEASONS  AND EVEN A BLOCKBUSTER TRADE FOR BLAKE GRIFFIN WASN T ENOUGH TO SALVAGE 2017 18 THE PISTONS WENT 152 176 OVER THE PAST FOUR SEASONS UNDER VAN GUNDY  AND HIS PERSONNEL DECISIONS HAVE COME UNDER MORE CRITICISM THAN HIS COACHING  DETROIT HASN T BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THE MOST OF ITS DRAFT POSITION  SPENDING FIRST ROUND PICKS ON STANLEY JOHNSON  HENRY ELLENSON AND LUKE KENNARD THIS PAST SEASON  KENNARD SHOT OVER 40 PERCENT FROM 3 POINT RANGE  BUT HE WAS TAKEN ONE SPOT AHEAD OF DONOVAN MITCHELL IN LAST YEAR S DRAFT  MITCHELL HAS BLOSSOMED INTO A ROOKIE OF THE YEAR CANDIDATE FOR UTAH THE TRADE FOR GRIFFIN WAS A BOLD ONE FOR THE PISTONS AND LEFT THEM WITH LIMITED FLEXIBILITY  NOT ONLY DID THE TEAM TAKE ON GRIFFIN S BIG CONTRACT  BUT DETROIT ALSO SENT A PROTECTED FIRST ROUND DRAFT PICK TO THE LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS IN THE DEAL GORES INDICATED LAST MONTH THAT CHANGES WOULD BE COMING  BUT IT WASN T CLEAR IF THAT MIGHT MEAN A FRONT OFFICE SHAKE UP OR A COACHING CHANGE  NOW THE PISTONS ARE EMBARKING ON BOTH THE TEAM S NEWS RELEASE MONDAY DIDN T SHED MUCH LIGHT ON THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS OF THESE PAST FEW WEEKS  IT DID SAY THAT VAN GUNDY WANTED TO RETURN STAN IS A COMPETITOR AND HE WANTED TO FINISH THE JOB  GORES SAID   HE RETOOLED A ROSTER THAT WE THINK CAN BE VERY COMPETITIVE IN THE EAST  I KNOW HE S DISAPPOINTED  AND THAT HE CARES DEEPLY ABOUT HIS PLAYERS  HIS STAFF  THIS ORGANIZATION AND THIS CITY  HE S ALSO A PROFESSIONAL WHO WILL MAKE SURE THIS IS A SEAMLESS TRANSITION  AND SOMEONE I HOPE WILL BE A FRIEND AND ADVISER TO ME LONG AFTER THIS TRANSITION IS COMPLETED VAN GUNDY DECLINED COMMENT VIA TEXT MESSAGE MONDAY CAVALIERS COACH TYRONN LUE WAS UNAWARE AND STUNNED TO LEARN OF VAN GUNDY S DISMISSAL  LUE PLAYED FOR VAN GUNDY ON ORLANDO S EASTERN CONFERENCE TITLE TEAM IN 2009 IT S JUST CRAZY TO SEE THAT YOU LET A GREAT GUY LIKE STAN GO  LUE SAID BEFORE THE CAVS HOSTED TORONTO IN GAME 4   I KNOW HE S EMOTIONAL BECAUSE HE S INTO THE GAME  HE LOVES THE GAME THAT MUCH  BUT AS FAR AS X S AND O S  UNDERSTANDING DIFFERENT TEAMS  DIFFERENT SCHEMES  HIS PLAYERS  HE S ONE OF THE BEST AS FAR AS KNOWING THE BASKETBALL GAME AND WHAT IT TAKES WHEN VAN GUNDY WAS HIRED  HE TALKED ABOUT HOW THERE WOULD BE A GOOD CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FRONT OFFICE AND THE COACHING STAFF  THAT MUCH WAS OBVIOUS  SINCE HE WAS GOING TO BE PART OF BOTH  SETUPS LIKE THAT AREN T UNHEARD OF IN THE NBA  TOM THIBODEAU IS MINNESOTA S COACH AND PRESIDENT OF BASKETBALL OPERATIONS  BUT IT S NOT THAT EASY TO MAKE IT WORK ATLANTA COACH MIKE BUDENHOLZER HAD THE TITLE OF PRESIDENT OF BASKETBALL OPERATIONS  BUT HE GAVE UP THAT POSITION LAST YEAR  NOW HE S NO LONGER COACHING THE HAWKS EITHER  DOC RIVERS HAD DUAL ROLES WITH THE CLIPPERS  BUT LAST OFFSEASON  LAWRENCE FRANK TOOK OVER RESPONSIBILITY FOR BASKETBALL OPERATIONS WHILE RIVERS REMAINED THE COACH  SPURS COACH GREGG POPOVICH ALSO HAS THE TITLE OF PRESIDENT  BUT HE HAS HELP FROM GENERAL MANAGER R C  BUFORD  A TWO TIME NBA EXECUTIVE OF THE YEAR A DECADE AGO  THE PISTONS WERE ONE OF THE GAME S MOST RESPECTED ORGANIZATIONS AFTER REACHING THE EASTERN CONFERENCE FINALS SIX STRAIGHT YEARS AND WINNING THE NBA TITLE IN 2004  THEY SANK QUICKLY INTO IRRELEVANCE AFTER THAT DETROIT MISSED THE PLAYOFFS THE FINAL FIVE SEASONS OF JOE DUMARS  TENURE AS TEAM PRESIDENT  AND GORES  WHO TOOK OVER AS OWNER IN 2011  EVENTUALLY BROUGHT VAN GUNDY IN THE PISTONS MADE THE PLAYOFFS IN VAN GUNDY S SECOND SEASON  BUT THEY COULDN T BUILD ON THAT BREAKTHROUGH  THIS PAST SEASON WAS PARTICULARLY DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE MOST PRODUCTIVE OF CENTER ANDRE DRUMMOND S CAREER WITH DRUMMOND LEADING THE WAY  DETROIT STARTED 19 14 AND WON ON THE ROAD AGAINST THE LIKES OF GOLDEN STATE  OKLAHOMA CITY AND BOSTON  THEN AN ANKLE INJURY TO POINT GUARD REGGIE JACKSON DERAILED THE SEASON  AND NOT EVEN THE TRADE FOR GRIFFIN IN LATE JANUARY WAS ENOUGH TO PUSH THE PISTONS TO THE PLAYOFFS IN THEIR FIRST SEASON AT DOWNTOWN DETROIT S NEW LITTLE CAESARS ARENA WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MIN TO WISH STAN THE BEST AND THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU VE PUT INTO OUR TEAM THE LAST FOUR YEARS  DRUMMOND SAID MONDAY IN A MESSAGE ON HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT AP SPORTS WRITER TOM

CHALLENGES AS HE MOUNTS TRUMP S DEFENSE THROUGH THE MEDIA  BUT IT S PROVING TO BE A BEWILDERING DISPLAY IN AN INTERVIEW SUNDAY WITH ABC S  THIS WEEK  GIULIANI DISMISSED AS RUMOR HIS OWN STATEMENTS ABOUT TRUMP S PAYMENT TO ADULT FILM ACTRESS STORMY DANIELS  SAID HE CAN T SPEAK TO WHETHER THE PRESIDENT LIED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN HE DENIED KNOWLEDGE OF THE SILENCING AGREEMENT AND WOULDN T RULE OUT THE PRESIDENT ASSERTING HIS FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHT AGAINST SELF INCRIMINATION IN THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION  GIULIANI ALSO COULDN T SAY WHETHER TRUMP S PERSONAL LAWYER  MICHAEL COHEN  HAD MADE SIMILAR PAYMENTS TO OTHER WOMEN ON THE PRESIDENT S BEHALF GIULIANI SAID DESPITE TRUMP S OPENNESS TO SIT DOWN WITH SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER IN THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION  HE WOULD STRONGLY ADVISE TRUMP AGAINST IT I M GOING TO WALK HIM INTO A PROSECUTION FOR PERJURY LIKE MARTHA STEWART  GIULIANI ASKED  REFERRING TO THE LIFESTYLE MAVEN CONVICTED IN 2004 OF LYING TO INVESTIGATORS AND OBSTRUCTION IN AN INSIDER TRADING CASE GIULIANI COULDN T GUARANTEE THAT TRUMP WOULDN T END UP ASSERTING HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO REFUSE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT INCRIMINATE HIM HOW COULD I EVER BE CONFIDENT OF THAT  GIULIANI SAID DURING A 2016 CAMPAIGN RALLY  TRUMP DISPARAGED STAFFERS OF HIS DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT  HILLARY CLINTON  FOR TAKING THE FIFTH AMENDMENT DURING A CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION INTO CLINTON S USE OF A PRIVATE EMAIL SERVER AS SECRETARY OF STATE THE MOB TAKES THE FIFTH  TRUMP SAID   IF YOU RE INNOCENT  WHY ARE YOU TAKING THE FIFTH AMENDMENT GIULIANI ALSO SUGGESTED THAT TRUMP WOULDN T NECESSARILY COMPLY WITH A SUBPOENA FROM MUELLER  WHOSE INVESTIGATION TRUMP HAS REPEATEDLY LABELED A  WITCH HUNT A SUBPOENA FIGHT WOULD LIKELY FIND ITS WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT  WHICH HAS NEVER FIRMLY DECIDED WHETHER PRESIDENTS CAN BE COMPELLED TO SPEAK UNDER OATH GIULIANI S AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE OF THE PRESIDENT IN RECENT WEEKS HAS PLEASED TRUMP BUT EXASPERATED WHITE HOUSE AIDES AND ATTORNEYS AND LEFT EVEN SUPPORTERS QUESTIONING HIS TACTICS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE APPROACH LAST WEEK OF THE TRUMP TEAM PLAYS INTO THE HANDS OF MUELLER S TACTIC TO TRY  AT ANY COST  TO TRY TO FIND TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS AGAINST LOWER RANKING PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN BE SQUEEZED  ALAN DERSHOWITZ  A HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR WHO HAS INFORMALLY COUNSELED THE PRESIDENT  SAID ON NBC S  MEET THE PRESS GIULIANI  WHO WAS HIRED BY TRUMP LAST MONTH  SAID HE S STILL LEARNING THE FACTS OF THE MUELLER CASE AND THE DETAILS OF TRUMP S KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAYMENT TO DANIELS  WHO HAS ALLEGED A SEXUAL TRYST WITH TRUMP IN 2006  THE  000 PAYMENT WAS MADE BY COHEN DAYS BEFORE THE 2016 ELECTION  RAISING QUESTIONS OF COMPLIANCE WITH CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND ETHICS LAWS WHEN TRUMP WAS ASKED LAST MONTH ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE IF HE KNEW ABOUT THE PAYMENT TO DANIELS  HE SAID NO  TRUMP ALSO SAID HE DIDN T KNOW WHY COHEN HAD MADE THE PAYMENT OR WHERE HE GOT THE MONEY KELLYANNE CONWAY  A COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT  SAID SUNDAY ON CNN S  STATE OF THE UNION  THAT TRUMP MEANT THAT HE DIDN T KNOW ABOUT THE PAYMENT AT THE TIME IT WAS MADE  NOT AT THE TIME THE QUESTION WAS ASKED GIULIANI SAID LAST WEEK THAT TRUMP HAD REIMBURSED COHEN FOR THAT PAYMENT AND OTHER UNSPECIFIED ITEMS GIULIANI SAID THEN THAT HE FIRST MADE TRUMP AWARE OF THE PAYMENT SHORTLY AFTER JOINING THE CASE BUT NOW SAYS HE DOESN T KNOW WHEN TRUMP FOUND OUT ABOUT IT  GIULIANI TOLD BUZZFEED LAST WEEK THAT COHEN HAD COMPLAINED AFTER THE ELECTION ABOUT NOT BEING PAID BY TRUMP FOR HIS WORK IN SILENCING DANIELS AND THAT COHEN AND TRUMP THEN MET TO WORK OUT A  000 MONTHLY RETAINER TRUMP SAID FRIDAY THAT GIULIANI NEEDED TO  GET HIS FACTS STRAIGHT  BUT INSISTED THEY WEREN T CHANGING THEIR STORY  HE HAS CALLED DANIELS  ALLEGATIONS OF AN AFFAIR  FALSE AND EXTORTIONIST WHEN ASKED SUNDAY WHETHER TRUMP KNEW ABOUT THE PAYMENT TO DANIELS AFTER THE CAMPAIGN  GIULIANI DEMURRED I CAN T PROVE THAT  I CAN JUST SAY IT S RUMOR  GIULIANI SAID GIULIANI ALSO SAID HE WASN T SURE WHETHER COHEN HAD PAID OFF ANY OTHER WOMEN FOR TRUMP BUT INDICATED IT WAS POSSIBLE I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THAT  BUT I WOULD THINK IF IT WAS NECESSARY  YES  GIULIANI SAID COHEN NO LONGER REPRESENTS TRUMP  GIULIANI SAID  ADDING THAT IT WOULD  BE A CONFLICT RIGHT NOW  COHEN FACES A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION IN NEW YORK  WHERE FBI AGENTS RAIDED HIS HOME AND OFFICE SEVERAL WEEKS AGO SEEKING RECORDS ABOUT THE DANIELS NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT AND OTHER MATTERS MICHAEL AVENATTI  DANIELS  ATTORNEY  SAID SUNDAY ON  THIS WEEK  THAT HE THINKS IT S  OBVIOUS   TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THIS IS A COVER UP  THAT THEY ARE MAKING IT UP AS THEY GO ALONG LEGAL EXPERTS HAVE SAID THE REVELATION THAT TRUMP REIMBURSED COHEN RAISES NEW QUESTIONS  INCLUDING WHETHER THE MONEY REPRESENTED REPAYMENT OF AN UNDISCLOSED LOAN OR COULD BE SEEN AS REIMBURSEMENT FOR A CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURE  EITHER COULD BE LEGALLY PROBLEMATIC BOTH GIULIANI AND TRUMP HAVE INSISTED THE PAYMENT TO DANIELS WAS NOT A CAMPAIGN EXPENSE GIULIANI MAINTAINED SUNDAY THAT THE PAYMENT CAN T BE CONSIDERED AN IN KIND CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION BECAUSE THERE WAS ANOTHER EXPLANATION FOR IT THIS WAS FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE  TO PROTECT HIM  TO PROTECT HIS FAMILY  HE SAID   IT MAY HAVE INVOLVED THE CAMPAIGN  DOESN T MATTER GIULIANI SAID THE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT WITH COHEN WASN T REVEALED ON TRUMP S 2017 PERSONAL FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE BECAUSE  IT ISN T A LIABILITY  IT S AN EXPENSE THIS VERSION OF THE STORY CORRECTS QUOTE IN PARAGRAPH 9 TO DELETE THE WORD  AMENDMENT  IN THE FIRST REFERENCE TO  THE FIFTH

20180504,politics,election,3,RITTMAN  OHIO  IN THE DAILY RACE THAT IS HER LIFE  SHARLA BAKER DOES NOT THINK ABOUT POLITICS VERY MUCH SHE RISES EARLY  DRIVES TO THE GAS STATION TO BUY COFFEE  FEEDS HER BABY  DRESSES HER TWO OTHER CHILDREN  AGES 3 AND 2  AND HUSTLES THEM ALL OFF TO DAY CARE  BY 9 30 A M  SHE PULLS INTO A HAIR SALON 45 MINUTES AWAY  WHERE SHE IS TRAINING TO BE A COSMETOLOGIST  SHE WAXES AND CUTS ALL DAY LONG  MAKING ONLY THE MONEY SHE EARNS IN TIPS  WHICH ON A RECENT DAY LAST MONTH WAS  41 BUT MS  BAKER DOES VOTE  SHE PICKED BARACK OBAMA FOR PRESIDENT IN 2008 AND 2012  HE SEEMED SINCERE AND LOOKED LIKE A HAPPY FAMILY MAN  BUT MOST IMPORTANT  HE WAS A DEMOCRAT  HER GREAT GRANDMOTHER  WHO GREW UP POOR IN PENNSYLVANIA  ALWAYS SAID THAT DEMOCRATS LOOK OUT FOR THE POOR PEOPLE IN 2016  THOUGH  SHE VOTED FOR DONALD J  TRUMP  YES  HE WAS RICH AND SEEMED MEAN ON HIS TV SHOW  THE APPRENTICE  BUT SHE LIKED HOW HE TALKED ABOUT JOBS AND WAGES AND PEOPLE BEING LEFT OUT OF THE ECONOMY NOW  MORE THAN A YEAR LATER  SHE IS WAVERING I VOTED FOR TRUMP BECAUSE I WANTED SOME CHANGE GOING ON  SAID MS  BAKER  28  BUT THEN AGAIN  MAYBE HES GOING TO DO THE WRONG CHANGE THE SWING OF OBAMA VOTERS TO MR  TRUMP PROVED A DECISIVE FACTOR IN THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION  OF THE MORE THAN 650 COUNTIES THAT CHOSE MR  OBAMA TWICE  ABOUT A THIRD FLIPPED TO MR  TRUMP  MANY WERE IN STATES CRITICAL TO MR  TRUMPS WIN  LIKE IOWA  MICHIGAN  OHIO AND WISCONSIN JOHN SIDES  A POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR AT GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY  HAS ESTIMATED THAT 9 PERCENT OF VOTERS WHO CAST BALLOTS FOR MR  OBAMA ENDED UP VOTING FOR MR  TRUMP  AMONG WHITE VOTERS WHO HAD NEVER BEEN TO COLLEGE  IT WAS 22 PERCENT NOW  AS THE COUNTRY LURCHES INTO ANOTHER ELECTION SEASON  THIS TIME THE PRIZE IS CONTROL OF CONGRESS  A CRUCIAL QUESTION FOR DEMOCRATS IS WHETHER THEY WILL BE ABLE TO LURE THESE VOTERS BACK  THE PARTY HAS HAD SOME EARLY SUCCESSES  WINS IN ALABAMA  PENNSYLVANIA AND VIRGINIA HAVE GIVEN DEMOCRATS HOPE THAT VOTERS MIGHT BE SOURING ON MR  TRUMP  TO THE POINT THAT THE PARTY MIGHT FLIP CONTROL OF THE HOUSE AND POSSIBLY EVEN THE SENATE  NEXT WEEKS PRIMARY RACES IN OHIO AND WEST VIRGINIA  BOTH STATES THAT WENT FOR MR  TRUMP IN 2016  WILL ALSO SERVE AS TESTS OF VOTER ENTHUSIASM FOR DEMOCRATS WE RECENTLY ASKED PEOPLE WHO CAST BALLOTS FOR BOTH MR  OBAMA AND MR  TRUMP TO DESCRIBE HOW THEY FELT ABOUT THE PRESIDENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AHEAD OF THE MIDTERMS  IN INTERVIEWS WITH 38 VOTERS IN 14 STATES ACROSS FOUR MONTHS  A CLEAR PATTERN EMERGED  VOTERS SAID THEY DID NOT LIKE MR  TRUMP AS A PERSON AND DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES DIE HARD SUPPORTERS  SOME WERE EVEN EMBARRASSED BY HIM BUT MANY WERE BASICALLY SATISFIED WITH HIS POLICIES  THE TAX BILL WAS MILDLY POSITIVE  THEY SAID  SEVERAL HAD A BIT OF EXTRA MONEY IN THEIR PAYCHECK  THEY LIKED THAT HE WAS TRYING TO ADDRESS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION  ONLY A FEW REGRETTED THEIR VOTE VOTERS SAID THEY STILL LIKED MR  OBAMA AND THAT THEY VOTED FOR MR  TRUMP BECAUSE THEY DIDNT WANT TO CAST A BALLOT FOR HILLARY CLINTON  BUT THEY WERE STILL OPEN TO VOTING FOR DEMOCRATS  IF THE PARTY COULD COME UP WITH THE RIGHT CANDIDATES  FOR THE MOST PART  THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS WERE NOT YET ON THEIR RADARS HONESTLY  IT HASNT CROSSED MY MIND REALLY AT ALL  MS  BAKER SAID  WHEN ASKED ABOUT THEM SEVERAL VOTERS SAID THEY CHOSE MR  TRUMP FOR THE SAME REASON THEY CHOSE MR  OBAMA  A DEEP CRAVING FOR CHANGE AND DISGUST WITH BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES CHARLOTTE GRIFFIN  THE MAYOR OF BEAR GRASS  N C  A TOWN OF ABOUT 80 PEOPLE IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE STATE  SAID HER VOTE FOR MR  TRUMP WAS MORE AN ACT OF DESPERATION THAN A POSITIVE POLITICAL CHOICE  SHE HAD GROWN FURIOUS WITH THE NATIONAL POLITICAL CLASS  AND WHAT SHE SAW AS ITS WEALTH  IGNORANCE OF ORDINARY PEOPLES LIVES AND INABILITY TO GET ANYTHING DONE  IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHED CHOSEN A REPUBLICAN IN 50 YEARS OF VOTING  HER COUNTY FLIPPED TO MR  TRUMP AFTER CHOOSING MR  OBAMA TWICE DID I REALLY LIKE TRUMP  NO  I STILL DONT  MS  GRIFFIN SAID IN JANUARY  BUT AT LEAST I THOUGHT WE MIGHT MOVE  WE WERE IN A STALEMATE  WE WERE AT DEAD CENTER ZERO  WE WERE JUST SITTING THERE SPINNING OUR WHEELS IN JANUARY  MR  TRUMP WAS DEFENDING HIMSELF AFTER AN UPROAR OVER VULGAR COMMENTS HE WAS SAID TO HAVE MADE AT A CLOSED DOOR IMMIGRATION MEETING  WHEN ASKED AGAIN IN APRIL HOW SHE FELT  MS  GRIFFIN SAID MR  TRUMP WAS STILL SEVERELY TESTING MY SENSIBILITIES SHE SAID SHE PLANNED TO VOTE FOR THE SAME DEMOCRAT  G K  BUTTERFIELD  WHO HAS BEEN HER CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVE SINCE 2004 ITS A VARIABLE WIND SITUATION  SHE SAID BY PHONE  REFERRING TO THE COUNTRY  ONE DAY IT SEEMS TO BE GOING THIS WAY  AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN ITS GOING THE OTHER WAY COUNTIES LIKE MS  GRIFFINS THAT FLIPPED FROM MR  OBAMA TO MR  TRUMP HAVE LOST GROUND TO THE REST OF THE NATION  EVEN MORE SO THAN THE COUNTIES THAT HAVE BEEN SOLIDLY REPUBLICAN  FORTY YEARS AGO  WORKERS IN THE FLIP COUNTIES EARNED 85 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR EARNED BY WORKERS IN THE DEMOCRATIC STRONGHOLDS  BY 2016  THE RATIO HAD FALLEN TO 77 CENTS MS  BAKER WORKS AT A HAIR SALON STARK COUNTY  OHIO  WHICH FLIPPED TO MR  TRUMP AFTER CHOOSING MR  OBAMA TWICE  AND SHE SAID THE PRESIDENT WAS AN ECONOMIC DISAPPOINTMENT HES NOT THERE FOR THE POOR AND THE MIDDLE CLASS  SHE SAID  SITTING ON HER MOTHERS COUCH IN THE SMALL TOWN OF RITTMAN  I THOUGHT HE WOULD BE  BUT HES NOT MS  BAKER HAS WORKED MANY JOBS SINCE GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL IN 2007  AT A BOB EVANS RESTAURANT  AN ALDI SUPERMARKET  A SUBWAY SANDWICH SHOP  A PACKAGING PLANT FOR CAMERA MEMORY CHIPS AND A FRAME STORE  ALL PAID BADLY  SHE DIDNT HAVE HEALTH CARE OR 401 K  RETIREMENT BENEFITS WITH ANY OF THEM MS  BAKER HATED MAKING MINIMUM WAGE  AND HOW POWERLESS IT MADE HER FEEL  SO SHE ENROLLED IN BEAUTY SCHOOL TO GET MORE CONTROL OVER HER LIFE SHE HAD HOPED MR  TRUMP WOULD RAISE WAGES AND FORCE COMPANIES TO GIVE ALL THEIR EMPLOYEES BENEFITS  BUT THAT HASNT HAPPENED  ALL SHE HEARS NOW IS HARSH TALK BY REPUBLICANS ON TV ABOUT POOR PEOPLE  HOW PEOPLE WHO GET FOOD STAMPS ARE LAZY  HOW THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN BOXES OF FOOD INSTEAD OF MONEY MS  BAKER KNOWS THERE IS ANOTHER ELECTION THIS YEAR  BUT LIKE MOST PEOPLE INTERVIEWED FOR THIS ARTICLE  SHE SAID SHE HAD NOT LOOKED UP THE CANDIDATES YET  SHE WAS NOT SURE IF SHE WOULD VOTE MANY PEOPLE INTERVIEWED WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY TO SAY THEY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES TRUMP SUPPORTERS DONNA BURGRAFF  A REGISTERED INDEPENDENT IN CHILLICOTHE  IN SOUTHERN OHIO  SAID SHE FINDS MR  TRUMP BOORISH  SHE SAID THAT HE JUDGES WOMEN ON THEIR LOOKS AND SEEMS TO THRIVE ON EMBARRASSING PEOPLE  BEHAVIOR THAT MS  BURGRAFF  AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF EDUCATION AT OHIO UNIVERSITY  DISAPPROVES OF MS  BURGRAFF DID NOT LIKE HOW MR  TRUMP KEPT FALSELY ASSERTING THAT MR  OBAMA WAS NOT BORN IN THE UNITED STATES HOW COULD THAT HAVE BEEN ANYTHING BUT RACISM  SHE SAID STILL  ON ELECTION DAY 2016  MS  BURGRAFF VOTED FOR MR  TRUMP  IF RELUCTANTLY  SHE BELIEVED HE WAS THE BETTER CHOICE  AND LOOKING BACK SHE DOES NOT REGRET IT  THE TAX BILL HAS GIVEN HER AN EXTRA  A MONTH IN HER PAYCHECK I PULLED THE LEVER FOR TRUMP  AND IM NOT SORRY I DID  SHE SAID OVER LUNCH IN CHILLICOTHE IN MARCH  SHE SAID SHE PLANNED TO VOTE THIS FALL FOR HER REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN  BRAD WENSTRUP BUT OTHERS REGRETTED VOTING FOR MR  TRUMP AND ARE LESS CERTAIN HOW THEY WILL VOTE THIS FALL BRAD ZEIGLER  68  A RETIRED POLICE CHIEF IN WARREN COUNTY  ILL  SAID HE HAS NOT LIKED ANYTHING MR  TRUMP HAS DONE I THOUGHT MAYBE HELL LISTEN TO HIS ADVISERS AND THEYLL CONTAIN HIM  SAID MR  ZEIGLER  WHO  LIKE HIS COUNTY  VOTED FOR MR  OBAMA TWICE BEFORE CHOOSING MR  TRUMP  BUT THAT HASNT HAPPENED HE SAID HE IS FURIOUS AT HIMSELF FOR HAVING VOTED FOR MR  TRUMP AND IS OPEN TO VOTING FOR DEMOCRATS THIS FALL  EVEN THOUGH THE PARTY NO LONGER REALLY SPEAKS TO HIM IM CONCERNED ABOUT OUR ENVIRONMENT  HE SAID  IM CONCERNED ABOUT PEOPLES RIGHTS  I SOUND LIKE A FAR LEFT PERSON AND IM NOT INSTEAD  MR  ZEIGLER SAID HE FEELS POLITICALLY HOMELESS THE REPUBLICANS ARE ABOUT MONEY AND BIG BUSINESS AND THE DEMOCRATS HAVE LOST THEIR WAY  THEY ARE NOT

20180507,politics,politics,8,WASHINGTON  PRESIDENT TRUMP INTERVENED MONDAY IN THE WEST VIRGINIA REPUBLICAN SENATE PRIMARY  PLEADING WITH VOTERS A DAY BEFORE THE ELECTION TO OPPOSE THE FORMER MINE OPERATOR DON BLANKENSHIP  AND SIGNALING REPUBLICAN ANXIETY OVER THE PROSPECT OF FORFEITING YET ANOTHER RED STATE SENATE RACE MR  TRUMPS DECISION TO SPEAK OUT CAME AFTER SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL OF KENTUCKY  WHOM MR  BLANKENSHIP HAS TARGETED WITH DEEPLY PERSONAL ATTACKS AGAINST HIS WIFES ETHNICITY  URGED THE PRESIDENT TO WEIGH IN AGAINST MR  BLANKENSHIPS CANDIDACY  ACCORDING TO REPUBLICAN OFFICIALS FAMILIAR WITH THE CONVERSATION MR  TRUMP QUICKLY AGREED  SUGGESTING IN A TWEET THAT A VICTORY BY MR  BLANKENSHIP WOULD LEAD TO A REPRISE OF THE EMBARRASSING LOSS ROY S  MOORE SUFFERED LAST YEAR IN ALABAMA  A RELIABLY REPUBLICAN STRONGHOLD DON BLANKENSHIP  CURRENTLY RUNNING FOR SENATE  CANT WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION IN YOUR STATENO WAY  MR  TRUMP WROTE ON MONDAY MORNING  BEFORE REFERRING TO OTHER REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES IN THE PRIMARY  REMEMBER ALABAMA  VOTE REP  JENKINS OR A G  MORRISEY THE MANEUVERING BY PARTY LEADERS COMES BEFORE A HANDFUL OF STATES  INCLUDING INDIANA  OHIO AND WEST VIRGINIA  HOLD PRIMARY CONTESTS ON TUESDAY  INCREASINGLY NERVOUS REPUBLICAN LEADERS WANT TO NOMINATE CANDIDATES WHO CAN HELP THE PARTY KEEP CONTROL OF CONGRESS IN THIS FALLS MIDTERM ELECTIONS MR  TRUMP WARNED THAT IF MR  BLANKENSHIP PREVAILS IN THE PRIMARY IT WOULD ALL BUT ENSURE THE RE ELECTION OF THE INCUMBENT  JOE MANCHIN III  WHOM REPUBLICANS VIEW AS ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE SENATE DEMOCRATS  MR  BLANKENSHIP  THE FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF MASSEY ENERGY   SERVED A YEAR IN FEDERAL PRISON AFTER BEING CONVICTED OF CONSPIRING TO VIOLATE MINE SAFETY RULES IN CONNECTION WITH THE UPPER BIG BRANCH MINING DISASTER IN 2010 THAT CLAIMED 29 LIVES READ MORE ABOUT DON BLANKENSHIPS CAMPAIGN HERE THE TWEET ON MONDAY WAS A POLITICAL GIFT TO REPRESENTATIVE EVAN JENKINS AND ATTORNEY GENERAL PATRICK MORRISEY  MR  BLANKENSHIPS TWO REPUBLICAN RIVALS  IN A STATE MR  TRUMP WON OVERWHELMINGLY IN 2016 AND WHERE HE REMAINS POPULAR BOTH MEN SWIFTLY SEIZED ON MR  TRUMPS COMMENTS  WEAVING THEM INTO THEIR FINAL STUMP SPEECHES  CRAFTING LAST MINUTE DIGITAL ADS AND RECORDING NEW AUTOMATED PHONE CALLS PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST ANNOUNCED THIS MORNING HIS SUPPORT FOR EVAN JENKINS  A JENKINS ROBOCALL DECLARED  TAKING SOME LIBERTIES WITH THE PRESIDENTS TWEET  WHICH DID NOT FAVOR HIM OVER MR  MORRISEY  THE RECORDING BEGAN WITH THE PHRASE THIS IS A TRUMP VOTER ALERT AS IT SOUGHT TO FURTHER ALIGN MR  JENKINS WITH THE PRESIDENT IN A STATEMENT RESPONDING TO MR  TRUMP  MR  BLANKENSHIP SAID THE PRESIDENT IS A VERY BUSY MAN AND HE DOESNT KNOW ME AND HE DOESNT KNOW HOW FLAWED MY TWO MAIN OPPONENTS ARE IN THIS PRIMARY  HE ADDED THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT IS MISINFORMING HIM BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT ME TO BE IN THE U S  SENATE AND PROMOTE THE PRESIDENTS AGENDA THAT MR  TRUMP WOULD STEP INTO THE CONTEST AT ALL UNDERSCORES HOW ALARMED PARTY OFFICIALS ARE ABOUT THE PROSPECTS OF A BLANKENSHIP VICTORY THE PRESIDENT HAS FELT BURNED BY REPUBLICANS WHEN HE INJECTED HIMSELF INTO OTHER RACES ONLY TO SEE HIS PREFERRED CANDIDATES FALL SHORT  A VICTORY BY MR  BLANKENSHIP WOULD BE HIGHLY EMBARRASSING TO MR  TRUMP  COMING ON THE HEELS OF HIS INABILITY TO LIFT PARTY NOMINEES IN PENNSYLVANIA  THIS YEAR AND IN ALABAMA IN DECEMBER BUT THE RACE MAY BE CLOSE ENOUGH THAT MR  TRUMPS LAST MINUTE INTERVENTION PROVES ENOUGH TO DERAIL MR  BLANKENSHIP  A POWER PLAY THAT WOULD ONLY UNDERSCORE HIS CLOUT WITH THE PARTY BASE   WHITE HOUSE AIDES AND SENATE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING FOR THE LAST WEEK WHETHER THE PRESIDENT SHOULD COMMENT ON THE PRIMARY  AND AGREED HE SHOULD DO SO IF IT BECAME CLEAR MR  BLANKENSHIP COULD WIN  THREE OFFICIALS FAMILIAR WITH THE DELIBERATIONS SAID BY FRIDAY  WHEN PARTY OFFICIALS RECEIVED INTERNAL POLLING SHOWING THAT MR  BLANKENSHIP WAS STILL IN THE HUNT  THEY RATCHETED UP PRESSURE ON MR  TRUMP TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE FORMER COAL EXECUTIVE  WHO WAS IMPRISONED UNTIL LAST YEAR AND REMAINS ON PROBATION WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS HAD ALREADY BEGUN CONSIDERING POTENTIAL LANGUAGE FOR A TWEET OVER THE WEEKEND  IN A WIDE RANGING CALL WITH MR  MCCONNELL ON SUNDAY THAT WAS INITIATED BY MR  TRUMP  THE PRESIDENT INDICATED HE WAS WILLING TO WEIGH IN ON THE RACE  THE PRESIDENTS AIDES SAID HE MAY RECORD AN AUTOMATED CALL OF HIS OWN AGAINST MR  BLANKENSHIP STILL  MR  TRUMP HAS BEEN INTENSELY FOCUSED IN THE LAST WEEK ON THE SPECIAL COUNSELS INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIA AND THE UNEVEN DEFENSE OF A PAYMENT TO A PORNOGRAPHIC FILM ACTRESS OFFERED BY HIS NEW LAWYER  RUDOLPH W  GIULIANI  A FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK  AS A RESULT  ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS WERE NOT FULLY CERTAIN WHAT MR  TRUMP WOULD DO ABOUT THE WEST VIRGINIA RACE UNTIL THE EARLY MORNING TWEET THOUGH MR  TRUMP WILLINGLY INTERVENED IN THE PRIMARY CONTEST  SOME WEST WING AIDES BELIEVE THAT THE FIGHT IS MORE ABOUT MR  MCCONNELL  THE MAJORITY LEADER  THAN THE PRESIDENT  AND THEY GRUMBLED IN THE HOURS AFTER THE TWEET THAT SOME REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS  IN PARTICULAR MR  MCCONNELL  ARE INCONSISTENT WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT MR  TRUMPS POLICY SHOULD BE ON ENGAGING IN PRIMARIES MR  BLANKENSHIP HAS FACED A SERIES OF ATTACKS FROM REPUBLICAN GROUPS ALIGNED WITH MR  MCCONNELL FOR HIS ROLE IN THE UPPER BIG BRANCH MINING TRAGEDY  HE HAS ALSO BEEN CRITICIZED FOR KEEPING HIS OFFICIAL RESIDENCE IN LAS VEGAS AND REFUSING TO FULLY DISCLOSE HIS EXTENSIVE FINANCIAL HOLDINGS THE ATTACKS SENT MR  BLANKENSHIPS POLL NUMBERS TUMBLING  BUT WITH MR  JENKINS AND MR  MORRISEY DIVIDING VOTES  HE HAS REMAINED IN CONTENTION  INTERNAL SURVEYS TAKEN BY HIS RIVALS INDICATE THAT MR  BLANKENSHIP IS NEAR THE TOP OF THE FIELD THAT IS PARTLY BECAUSE HE HAS FRAMED HIS CONVICTION AS A PERSECUTION BY PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMAS JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  A STRATEGY AIMED AT TAPPING INTO THE DEEP ANIMUS TOWARD A FORMER PRESIDENT WHO MANY IN THE STATE BELIEVE WAGED A WAR ON COAL IN RECENT WEEKS MR  BLANKENSHIP DIPPED INTO HIS PERSONAL WEALTH TO AIR A SERIES OF INCENDIARY ADS TARGETING THE FAMILY OF MR  MCCONNELL  WHO IS MARRIED TO TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY ELAINE CHAO SWAMP CAPTAIN MITCH MCCONNELL HAS CREATED MILLIONS OF JOBS FOR CHINA PEOPLE  MR  BLANKENSHIP SAID IN ONE COMMERCIAL  ALLUDING TO THE SHIPPING BUSINESS OF MR  MCCONNELLS FATHER IN LAW  MR  BLANKENSHIP HAS ALSO REFERRED TO MR  MCCONNELLS FATHER IN LAW  AN AMERICAN CITIZEN  AS A WEALTHY CHINAPERSON MR  BLANKENSHIP ALSO CALLED MR  MCCONNELL COCAINE MITCH FOR FAR FETCHED CLAIMS THAT A SHIP CONNECTED TO MS  CHAOS FATHER ONCE SMUGGLED DRUGS MR  MCCONNELL  WHO IS DEEPLY UNPOPULAR AMONG REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS  HAS LARGELY AVOIDED WADING INTO THE FEUD  BUT HAS BEEN PRIVATELY FUMING ABOUT THE ATTACKS ON HIS WIFES FAMILY HE HAS  THOUGH  BEEN ABLE TO FIND SOME AMUSEMENT IN HIS NEW NICKNAME  JOKINGLY ANSWERING THE PHONE COCAINE MITCH  ACCORDING TO ONE OF HIS ADVISERS LAST WEEK  HE EMAILED AN ALLY IN EVIDENT WONDER  I NEVER EVEN SMOKED CIGARETTES UNTIL MONDAY  THE CLOSEST THE PRESIDENT HAD COME TO WEIGHING IN ON THE RACE WAS WHEN HE BROUGHT MR  JENKINS AND MR  MORRISEY TO A ROUNDTABLE FOCUSED ON THE TAX OVERHAUL AND SAT BETWEEN THEM   HE EVEN POLLED THE AUDIENCE TO GAUGE WHO HAD MORE SUPPORT PART OF THE CHALLENGE FOR THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT HAS BEEN THAT MR  JENKINS AND MR  MORRISEY HAVE LARGELY TARGETED EACH OTHER  MOST RECENTLY DURING A BITTER FOX NEWS DEBATE LAST WEEK  NEITHER HAS BEEN ABLE TO EMERGE AS THE CLEAR FRONT RUNNER  AND REPUBLICAN LEADERS DO NOT HAVE A STRONG PREFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO MR  JENKINS IS A FORMER DEMOCRAT WHO REPRESENTS THE COAL PRODUCING PART OF THE STATE  HAVING UPSET A VETERAN INCUMBENT IN 2014  WHILE MR  MORRISEY IS A NEW JERSEY TRANSPLANT WHO MADE A NAME FOR HIMSELF SUING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION THEY EACH HOPED MR  TRUMPS LATE INTERVENTION COULD HELP THEM PERSUADE UNDECIDED VOTERS LESS THAN 24 HOURS BEFORE POLLS OPEN IN AN INTERVIEW  MR  MORRISEY  WHO UNTIL THIS WEEKEND HAD LARGELY IGNORED MR  BLANKENSHIP  SAID THE PRESIDENTS STATEMENT SENDS A MESSAGE THAT WEST VIRGINIA VOTERS SHOULD REJECT THE CRIMINAL CONVICT DON BLANKENSHIP REFLECTING HOW TIGHT THE RACE HAS BECOME IN ITS FINAL HOURS  MR  MORRISEY AIMED WITHERING CRITICISM AT MR  BLANKENSHIP THIS IS SOMEONE WHOSE WHOLE CAREER DEMONSTRATES HE BELIEVES HE IS ABOVE THE LAW  HE SAID  ASSERTING THAT MR  BLANKENSHIP WOULD BE CRUSHED IN THE GENERAL ELECTION AGAINST MR  MANCHIN MR  BLANKENSHIP  THOUGH  SAID NO ONE  AND I MEAN NO ONE  WILL TELL US HOW TO VOTE  AND SEEMED TO SUGGEST THAT MR  TRUMP HAD DRIFTED FROM THE SPIRT OF HIS OWN CANDIDACY BY NOT EMBRACING THE HARD EDGED CAMPAIGN HE HAD WAGED AS SOME HAVE SAID  I AM TRUMPIER THAN TRUMP  AND THIS MORNING PROVES IT  HE CLAIMED
20180503,business,market,9,LUKE PRITCHARD AND JONNY LAXTON WERE 13 WHEN THEY MET AT A BOARDING SCHOOL IN CROWTHORNE  ENGLAND  IN 2011  THEY BONDED OVER A SHARED LOVE OF UNDERGROUND MUSIC AND IN 2014 STARTED A YOUTUBE CHANNEL  COLLEGE MUSIC  TO PROMOTE THE ARTISTS THEY LIKED  AT FIRST  THE CHANNEL GREW SLOWLY  THEN  IN THE SPRING OF 2016  MR  PRITCHARD DISCOVERED 24 7 LIVE STREAMING  A FEATURE THAT ALLOWS YOUTUBES USERS TO BROADCAST A SINGLE VIDEO CONTINUOUSLY  COLLEGE MUSIC HAD 794 SUBSCRIBERS IN APRIL 2015  A YEAR BEFORE MR  PRITCHARD AND MR  LAXTON STARTED STREAMING  A MONTH AFTER THEY BEGAN  THEY HAD MORE THAN 18 440  IN APRIL 2016  THEY HAD 98 110 SUBSCRIBERS AND AS OF LAST MONTH  WITH THREE ACTIVE LIVE STREAMS  THEY HAVE MORE THAN TRIPLE THAT AMOUNT  WITH 334 000  THEY MAKE ABOUT  000 A MONTH FROM THE STREAMS THE BOYS STUMBLED UPON A NEW STRATEGY  ONE THAT  IN THE PAST TWO YEARS  HAS HELPED A CERTAIN KIND OF YOUTUBE CHANNEL ACHIEVE WIDESPREAD POPULARITY  HUNDREDS OF INDEPENDENTLY RUN CHANNELS HAVE BEGUN TO STREAM MUSIC NONSTOP  WITH VIDEOS THAT COMBINE PLAYLISTS WITH HUNDREDS OF SONGS AND SHORT  LOOPED ANIMATIONS  OFTEN TAKEN FROM ANIME FILMS WITHOUT COPYRIGHT PERMISSION  LIVE STREAMS COME IN MANY DIFFERENT GENRES  TWO OF COLLEGE MUSICS STREAMS ARE PART OF A FAMILY OF CHANNELS THAT BROADCAST WHAT THE BROADCASTERS CALL LOFI  LOW FIDELITY  HIP HOP  MELLOW MUSIC THAT WOULD SOUND FAMILIAR TO FANS OF J  DILLA AND NUJABES  SUCH VIDEOS  WITH SUBSCRIBER COUNTS IN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS  ARE SOME OF THE MOST POPULAR CONTINUOUSLY STREAMING MUSIC STATIONS ON THE SITE  MANY ARE RUN BY YOUNG EUROPEANS  WHO MAY HAVE ONLY A PASSING FAMILIARITY WITH THE HISTORY OF THE MUSIC THEY ARE SPREADING AND THEY DONT KNOW WHY  BUT THEIR USERS REALLY DO INSIST ON THE ANIME IMAGES  MR  LAXTON SAID FANS PROTESTED WHEN THE IMAGERY OF THE VIDEO WAS CHANGED  AND PROVIDED A SCREENSHOT OF A PARTICULARLY UPSET USER REQUESTING THAT AN ANIME CLIP BE RESTORED TO ONE OF ITS THREE STATIONS THE CHANNELS OCCUPY A PRECARIOUS SPACE BETWEEN YOUTUBES ALGORITHM AND ITS COPYRIGHT POLICING  DRAWING COMPARISONS TO THE UNLICENSED PIRATE RADIO STATIONS OF THE 20TH CENTURY  RECREATED IN THE DIGITAL SPHERE  MANY OF THE CHANNELS BLINK IN AND OUT OF EXISTENCE WITHIN A WEEK  BUT THEIR PRESENCE HAS BECOME A COMPELLING PART OF THE SITES MUSICAL ECOSYSTEM  AND WHILE COMPETITORS LIKE SPOTIFY ARE GAINING  YOUTUBE STILL DOMINATES THE STREAMING WORLD  ACCORDING TO THE LATEST MUSIC CONSUMER INSIGHT REPORT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE PHONOGRAPHIC INDUSTRY  WHEN MR  PRITCHARD AND MR  LAXTON STARTED STREAMING  THEY RAN THE CHANNEL FROM MR  PRITCHARDS DORM  WHICH WAS RIGHT ABOVE THE HOUSEMASTERS ROOM  EVERY OTHER DAY HED TELL ME TO TURN IT DOWN BECAUSE HE COULD HEAR THE BASS BUMPING  MR  PRITCHARD SAID MR  PRITCHARD  NOW 20  SAID THERE ARE SO MANY NEW COMPETITORS NOW THAT IT HAS BECOME FAR MORE DIFFICULT TO GET THE KIND OF INSTANT SUCCESS THAT HE AND MR  LAXTON DISCOVERED TWO YEARS AGO  LIVE STREAMS LIKE THEIRS SUCCEED IN PART BY EXPLOITING USER BEHAVIOR  ACCORDING TO CHANNEL OPERATORS  YOUTUBE USERS OFTEN CLICK OFF A VIDEO AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES  BEFORE THE CLIP HAS CONCLUDED  BUT USERS WHO LISTEN TO LIVE STREAMS TEND TO PLAY THEM FOR A HALF HOUR OR MORE  OFTEN AS BACKGROUND MUSIC  THAT BOOSTS THE VIDEOS RETENTION RATES  WHICH COMPELS YOUTUBE TO PROMOTE THEM MORE WIDELY  A YOUTUBE SPOKESWOMAN  VERONICA NAVARRETE  SAID THAT WHILE YOUTUBE LIVE HAD BEEN AVAILABLE SINCE 2011 AND CONTINUOUS LIVE STREAMING HAD BEEN AVAILABLE SINCE LATE 2012  THE NUMBER OF LIVE CHANNELS THAT STREAM DAILY HAS QUADRUPLED YEAR OVER YEAR SINCE 2016 ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR CHANNELS IN THE LOFI FAMILY IS CALLED CHILLEDCOW  ITS RUN BY DIMITRI  A 23 YEAR OLD WHO LIVES ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF PARIS  HE STARTED HIS LIVE STREAM ON FEB  25  2017  AND HIS LISTENERSHIP  WELL  AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE BELOW IMAGE  IT GREW   DIMITRI ASKED THAT HIS LAST NAME NOT BE USED YOUTUBE DISCIPLINES STATIONS THAT COLOR OUTSIDE THE LINES  STREAMS ARE SHUT DOWN ALL THE TIME AND EVEN VETERANS OF THE SCENE GET DINGED  BAS  28  WHO RUNS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR CHANNELS IN THE LOFI FAMILY  CHILLHOP MUSIC  FROM HIS HOME IN ROTTERDAM  WAS RECENTLY ASSESSED A STRIKE OVER A COPYRIGHT VIOLATION  AT THE MOMENT  HE DOES NOT HAVE AN ACTIVE LIVE STREAM  THE PLATFORMS WILLINGNESS TO ENFORCE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS  EVEN CASUALLY  HAS FORCED STATIONS LIKE CHILLHOP MUSIC  COLLEGE MUSIC  CHILLEDCOW AND OTHERS TO FORM THEIR OWN RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE ARTISTS THE ARTISTS DONT GET ANGRY WITH US CAUSE WE KNOW THEM AND A LOT OF THE MUSIC IS FROM OUR LABEL  SAID BAS  WHO REFUSED TO USE HIS FULL NAME BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT PEOPLE BOTHERING HIM ON HIS PERSONAL ACCOUNTS  THEY RIGHTFULLY GET ANGRY AT SOME OTHER CHANNELS THOUGH AS A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE JUST CAPITALIZING ON THE ARTISTS CHANNELS LIKE COLLEGE MUSIC  CHILLEDCOW  CHILLHOP MUSIC AND OTHERS ARE UNLIKELY TO HAVE A BROAD IMPACT ON THE MUSIC INDUSTRY  BUT THEY REPRESENT AN UNDERGROUND ALTERNATIVE TO THE STREAMING HEGEMONY OF SPOTIFY AND APPLE MUSIC  THE INDUSTRY COMMENTATOR BOB LEFSETZ SAID THAT WHILE THE STATIONS WERE NOT LIKELY TO BECOME A LUCRATIVE ENDEAVOR  THEY WERE A WAY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SEIZE POWER BACK FROM CULTURAL GATEKEEPERS NICO PEREZ  A FOUNDER OF MIXCLOUD  APPLAUDED THE CHANNELS  AND SAID THEY WERE A NATURAL RESPONSE TO THE HOMOGENEITY OF TRADITIONAL RADIO PLAYLISTS  BUT HE WAS TROUBLED BY THE TOTAL POWER THAT YOUTUBE YIELDED OVER THE ECOSYSTEM IF THEY GROW LARGE ENOUGH  YOUTUBE WILL HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY WANT TO SUPPORT IT OR IF ITS NOT WHAT THEYRE LOOKING FOR ON THE PLATFORM  HE SAID THESE DAYS  MR  PRITCHARD RUNS COLLEGE MUSIC FROM HIS HOME IN READING  HAVING DROPPED OUT OF LAW SCHOOL TO PURSUE MUSIC FULL TIME   HES NOW DEALING WITH TWO HOUSEMASTERS  HIS PARENTS  MR  LAXTON  19  IS AT UNIVERSITY IN LEEDS  WHERE HE SCOUTS AND SIGNS ARTISTS FOR THE RECORD LABEL THE TWO HAVE STARTED TOGETHER  ALSO CALLED COLLEGE MUSIC  ON A GOOD MONTH  IT BRINGS IN ANOTHER  000  THEY SAID  I THINK A YEAR DOWN THE LINE  THE THING THAT WELL BE PUSHING MOST WILL BE THE LABEL  SAID MR  LAXTON BUT HE SAID THE NEW COMPETITION ON YOUTUBE WAS NOT THE MOTIVATING FACTOR  IN FACT  HE SAID  HE WAS HAPPY THAT THE SCENE HAD BLOWN UP SO QUICKLY ME AND LUKE STARTED OUT TRYING TO GET MORE PEOPLE HEARING THE MUSIC THAT WE THOUGHT DESERVED TO BE HEARD  HE SAID  THE MORE PEOPLE THERE ARE IN THE MARKET  I THINK THATS A BETTER THING  IT MEANS THERE ARE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE ARTISTS WE CAME ABOUT TO HELP

THAT CAN BE CONSUMED IS NOW UNDERSTOOD AS A BRAND  AND ON THE INTERNET  THATS EVERY LAST BIT OF CONTENT  THIS IS HOW A CONSULTANT LIKE ERIC GARLAND CAN  ON THE STRENGTH OF A VIRAL TWEET STORM ABOUT THE GAME THEORY BEHIND AMERICAN POLITICS  BRAND HIMSELF AS A RUSSIAN CONSPIRACY SAGE AND MARKET SUBSCRIPTIONS TO  GAMETHEORYTODAY  ITS ALSO WHY ACTUAL BRANDS  LIKE HAMBURGER HELPER OR DENNYS  HANG AROUND SOCIAL MEDIA MASQUERADING AS PEOPLE  POSTING JOKES AND MEMES AND ROASTING HATERS  EVEN THE MOST CYNICAL INTERNET USERS SPEAK SEMISERIOUSLY ABOUT OUR POSTS BEING ON BRAND OR OFF BRAND  THERE IS NO REFUGE FROM THE LOGIC OF THE BRAND  AND IF THERE IS  SOME UP AND COMING STRATEGIST WILL SOON ENOUGH BOLSTER HER OWN BRAND BY COLONIZING IT CORPORATE BRANDING FIRST EMERGED AS A PRACTICAL MEASURE  IN THE 1920S  THE RISE OF AMERICAN CONSUMER CULTURE PRODUCED A GLUT OF PRODUCTS THAT COULDNT BE DIFFERENTIATED FROM ONE ANOTHER ON SIGHT  THE BRANDING THAT EMERGED AROUND THEM HAS  AT POINTS  HAD A GLIMMER OF UTILITY TO IT  SERVING AS A WAY TO ESTABLISH THE AUTHENTICITY AND RELIABILITY OF A PARTICULAR THING FROM A PARTICULAR SOURCE  BUT THE IDEA OF A BRAND RAPIDLY SPREAD BEYOND THAT SEAL OF QUALITY AND SUBSUMED A WHOLE CONSTELLATION OF SENTIMENTS A COMPANY MIGHT PROVOKE IN A PERSON  MANY OF THEM WHOLLY ABSTRACTED FROM THE PRODUCT ITSELF  IN HER 1999 BOOK  NO LOGO  NAOMI KLEIN PRESENTS THE ACCELERATION OF CORPORATE BRANDING AS A KIND OF HOLLOWING OUT  COMPANIES THAT USED TO MANUFACTURE WARES OR HARVEST FOODS  THAT USED TO SELL THINGS  BECAME BRANDS  WHICH SELL IDEAS  ACTUAL PRODUCTION PROCESSES BECAME SECONDARY  OUTSOURCED TO FAR FLUNG SUBCONTRACTORS  THE BRANDS REAL INVESTMENT WAS TO IMBUE THE PRODUCTS WITH MEANING  NIKE ISNT A RUNNING SHOE COMPANY  KLEIN WROTE IN THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION  IT IS ABOUT THE IDEA OF TRANSCENDENCE THROUGH SPORTS AT ITS CORE  BRANDING IS A PROCESS OF HUMANIZATION  IT IMBUES COMPANIES WITH PERSONALITIES  OFTEN THE PERSONIFICATION IS OVERT  ONCE THERE WERE AUNT JEMIMA AND BETTY CROCKER  NOW THERES THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION AND FENTY BEAUTY  AS THE CELEBRITY ADMAN BRUCE BARTON ONCE SAID  INSTITUTIONS HAVE SOULS  JUST AS MEN AND NATIONS HAVE SOULS  A COMPANY WITH A SOUL BECOMES RELATABLE  BUT IN A DECEPTIVE WAY  THE MORE WE THINK OF IT AS A BRAND  THE MORE OUR FOCUS SHIFTS AWAY FROM THINGS LIKE LABOR PRACTICES AND SUPPLY CHAINS AND ONTO ISSUES OF NARRATIVE AND IDENTITY SO WENDYS  WHICH USED TO BE PERSONIFIED BY A LITTLE RED HAIRED GIRL OR BY ITS FOUNDER  DAVE THOMAS  IS NOW PERSONIFIED BY A SOCIAL MEDIA TEAM RENOWNED FOR ITS ABILITY TO TWEET LIKE A RUDE TEENAGER  BUT IF COMPANIES HAVE COME TO ACT MORE LIKE PEOPLE  THE REVERSE IS ALSO TRUE  NOW PEOPLE ACT LIKE COMPANIES  CAREFULLY MONITORING THE MEANINGS WE PROJECT INTO THE WORLD  THE BRAND MANAGEMENT OF THE WENDYS TEAM HAPPENS RIGHT ALONGSIDE THAT OF ACTUAL TEENAGERS  WHO SHAPE THEIR IMAGES TO ATTRACT ATTENTION AND GOOD WILL  BUILD UP ENOUGH OF THOSE THINGS  AND A PERSON  MUCH LIKE A COMPANY  CAN BECOME PROFITABLE  A BLOCKBUSTER PERSONA LIKE RIHANNAS MIGHT TRANSLATE INTO THE MARKETABILITY OF A  BODY LUMINIZER  A BACHELOR CONTESTANTS PERSONA MIGHT BE LIMITED TO ENDORSING HERBAL SUPPLEMENTS ON INSTAGRAM  A POPULAR INTERNET FIGURE MIGHT SIMPLY CROWDFUND TO COVER EXPENSES  COMPANIES STILL TRY TO SELL US THINGS  BUT NOW WERE ENCOURAGED TO PITCH OURSELVES TO THEM  TOO  A LIFESTYLE BRAND  AFTER ALL  IS JUST A REGULAR BRAND THAT APPEALS TO PEOPLES PERSONAL BRANDS  WHICH  IN TURN  ARE INCREASINGLY ORGANIZED AROUND COURTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH LIFESTYLE BRANDS  IT ALL COLLAPSES INTO BRANDING PERSONAL BRAND WAS COINED BY A WRITER NAMED TOM PETERS IN A FAST COMPANY ARTICLE  THE BRAND CALLED YOU  THIS WAS IN 1997  AS LIFESTYLE BRANDING WAS BEGINNING TO EMERGE  ALL KINDS OF PRODUCTS  PETERS WROTE  ARE FIGURING OUT HOW TO TRANSCEND THE NARROW BOUNDARIES OF THEIR CATEGORIES AND BECOME A BRAND SURROUNDED BY TOMMY HILFIGER LIKE BUZZ  AT THE END OF THE ESSAY  HE PLUGGED HIS NEW CD ROM PART OF WHAT PETERS ENVISIONED WAS HUMAN BEINGS THINKING OF THEMSELVES IN THE SAME WAY  THE INTERNET HAD MADE PEOPLE IDENTICAL  TOO  JUST MESSAGES STACKED IN A VIRTUAL BOX  LIKE THE SNACKS AND SNEAKERS THAT CAME BEFORE THEM  THEY NEEDED WAYS TO DIFFERENTIATE THEMSELVES  WHERE THE BRAND CALLED YOU BECOMES FASCINATING  THOUGH  IS WHEN IT APPLIES THIS LOGIC TO EMPLOYMENT  PETERS SAW PERSONAL BRANDING AS A WAY TO LIBERATE YOURSELF FROM THE CONSTRAINTS OF CORPORATE LIFE  HE DESCRIBED LIFELONG STEADY EMPLOYMENT AS WHAT WE USED TO CALL INDENTURED SERVITUDE  IN ITS PLACE  HE HAILED THE EMERGENCE OF A NEW PROJECT WORLD  WHERE WORK IS ORGANIZED INTO BITE SIZED PACKETS  TO THRIVE IN SUCH A WORLD  HE ENCOURAGED READERS TO COLLECT AND MARKET SKILLS AND CONNECTIONS  TO THROW OUT THEIR RSUMS IN FAVOR OF A MARKETING BROCHURE FOR BRAND YOU HE IMAGINED EMPOWERED WORKERS DIVESTING THEMSELVES FROM CORPORATE DRUDGERY  BUT WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED WAS THE OPPOSITE  OUR CORPORATIONS DIVESTED FROM US  OVER THE TWO DECADES SINCE THE BRAND CALLED YOU  FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT HAS STEADILY ATOMIZED INTO CASUAL  PART TIME AND TEMPORARY WORK  CULMINATING IN THE PROJECT WORLD OF THE GIG ECONOMY  MICROJOBS DRIVING FOR UBER  RUNNING ERRANDS FOR TASKRABBIT OR COOKING UP SIDE HUSTLES ON FIVERR  A COMPANY WHOSE SUBWAY ADS GLAMORIZE PITILESS OVERWORK  SLEEP DEPRIVATION IS YOUR DRUG OF CHOICE  DESPITE ITS BEING NAMED AFTER A WOEFULLY SMALL AMOUNT OF CASH THE OPPORTUNITIES TO MARKET OURSELVES ONLINE ARE NEVER ENDING  BUT THE FINANCIAL REWARDS REMAIN ELUSIVE  HEADLINES HERALDING THE MULTIMILLION DOLLAR INCOMES OF YOUTUBE STARS CAN MAKE CULTIVATING A BRAND THERE SEEM LIKE A REAL CAREER OPTION  BUT A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT EVEN CHANNELS AMONG THE TOP 3 PERCENT OF VIEWERSHIP CAN BRING IN AS LITTLE AS  800 A YEAR   WHEN A WOULD BE YOUTUBE STAR OPENED FIRE IN THE COMPANYS OFFICES  IT WAS PERHAPS THE FIRST WORKPLACE SHOOTING OF THE GIG ECONOMY  MARKETING MONEY FLOWS THROUGH INSTAGRAM  BUT FEW OF THE INFLUENCERS THERE SEE MUCH OF IT  THE CORNELL PROFESSOR BROOKE ERIN DUFFY HAS DESCRIBED THEM AS ENGAGING IN ASPIRATIONAL LABOR  A MODE OF  MOSTLY  UNCOMPENSATED  INDEPENDENT WORK THAT IS PROPELLED BY THE MUCH VENERATED IDEAL OF GETTING PAID TO DO WHAT YOU LOVE THEY BURNISH THEIR BRANDS BASED ON THE UNSPOKEN ASSUMPTION THAT A SUCCESSFUL BRAND LEADS NATURALLY TO ACTUAL SUCCESS  BUT THIS TRICKY CONVERSION RARELY TAKES PLACE  AND THE WORK BEHIND IT TENDS TO BE LESS VALUABLE TO US THAN IT IS  IN THE AGGREGATE  TO THE COMPANIES THAT FACILITATE IT  ALL THE TIME I THOUGHT I WAS BUILDING MY OWN BRAND  SEEDING THE INTERNET WITH PERSONAL INFORMATION IN A BID TO DOMINATE THE GOOGLE RESULTS  FENDING OFF CHALLENGERS LIKE AMANDA HESS  THE SAINTLY DOCTOR WHO DELAYED GIVING BIRTH IN ORDER TO DELIVER ANOTHER WOMANS BABY FIRST  I WAS ENRICHING ANY NUMBER OF TECH COMPANIES TOM PETERS ENCOURAGED US TO BREAK THE CHAINS OF THE CORPORATE WORLD IN FAVOR OF PURSUING A LIFE OF AUTONOMOUS CREATIVITY  BUT NOW BRANDING HAS TAKEN OVER NOT JUST WORK BUT LIFE ITSELF  SEIZING CONTROL OF OUR APPEARANCES  OUR SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS  EVEN OUR APPROACH TO CIVIL SOCIETY  AFTER STARBUCKS STAFF CALLED THE POLICE ON TWO BLACK MEN WAITING IN ONE OF THEIR STORES  THEN CLOSED 8 000 LOCATIONS TO CONDUCT BIAS TRAINING FOR EMPLOYEES  A FORBES CONTRIBUTOR PRAISED THE COMPANY FOR SHOWING BRAND PURPOSE AND PROMISE THAT COULD PROVIDE DIRECTION FOR BOTH STARBUCKS AND SOCIETY AT LARGE  EVEN IN THE AGE OF THE PERSONAL BRAND  CORPORATIONS RULE
20180502,politics,election,4,WASHINGTON  PRESIDENT TRUMP HIRED ON WEDNESDAY A WASHINGTON LAWYER WHO REPRESENTED BILL CLINTON DURING HIS IMPEACHMENT  A SIGN THAT THE WHITE HOUSE SEES NO IMMEDIATE END TO ITS LEGAL PROBLEMS AND IS GIRDING FOR A COMBATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH A NEW CONGRESS AFTER THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS THE NEW LAWYER  EMMET T  FLOOD  WILL REPLACE TY COBB  THE WHITE HOUSE LAWYER WHO PERSUADED MR  TRUMP TO COOPERATE WITH THE SPECIAL COUNSEL FOR THE FIRST YEAR OF ITS INVESTIGATION  MR  COBB ASSURED THE PRESIDENT THAT DOING SO WOULD BRING THE INVESTIGATION TO A SWIFT END THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED  AND LAWYERS SAY THE SPECIAL COUNSEL  ROBERT S  MUELLER III  IS UNLIKELY TO CONCLUDE HIS WORK SOON  MR  TRUMPS ADVISERS SEE A NEW PERIL ON THE HORIZON  IF DEMOCRATS WIN CONTROL OF THE HOUSE  THEY WOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE SUBPOENAS OR EVEN CONVENE IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS MR  FLOODS RSUM IS WELL SUITED FOR SUCH FIGHTS  HE JOUSTED WITH CONGRESS AND AN INDEPENDENT COUNSEL DURING THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION  AS A WHITE HOUSE LAWYER DURING GEORGE W  BUSHS SECOND TERM  HE HELPED FEND OFF CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE FIRING OF FEDERAL PROSECUTORS  AND IN PRIVATE PRACTICE  HE REPRESENTED FORMER VICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY EMMET FLOOD WILL BE JOINING THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF TO REPRESENT THE PRESIDENT AND THE ADMINISTRATION AGAINST THE RUSSIA WITCH HUNT  THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY  SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS  SAID IN A STATEMENT  ADOPTING THE PRESIDENTS DERISIVE LABEL FOR THE SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION  TY COBB  A FRIEND OF THE PRESIDENT  WHO HAS DONE A TERRIFIC JOB  WILL BE RETIRING AT THE END OF THE MONTH LIKE MANY VETERANS OF THE MEANDERING  YEARSLONG CLINTON INVESTIGATION  MR  FLOOD HAS TOLD PEOPLE HE IS WARY OF SPECIAL COUNSEL INQUIRIES  HE HAS EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT THE SCOPE OF MR  MUELLERS INVESTIGATION IN PARTICULAR  A VIEW THAT RESONATES WITH THE PRESIDENT  MR  COBB  BY CONTRAST  HAS EXPRESSED ADMIRATION FOR MR  MUELLER AND HAS NEVER ADOPTED THE PRESIDENTS WITCH HUNT LANGUAGE MR  COBB  67  WAS NOT A SUPPORTER OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN  AND THOUGH HE EXPRESSED FONDNESS FOR MR  TRUMP  HE REPEATEDLY REMINDED PEOPLE THAT HE REPRESENTED THE WHITE HOUSE AS AN INSTITUTION  NOT THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF  IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR TO SERVE THE COUNTRY IN THIS CAPACITY AT THE WHITE HOUSE  MR  COBB SAID IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW  I WISH EVERYBODY WELL MOVING FORWARD MR  FLOOD IS EXPECTED TO TAKE A MORE ADVERSARIAL APPROACH THAN MR  COBB  WHO VOLUNTARILY TURNED OVER WHITE HOUSE DOCUMENTS TO MR  MUELLER  HE HAS CREDITED THAT COOPERATION WITH PREVENTING A PROTRACTED  AND LOSING  SUBPOENA FIGHT THAT WOULD HAVE HOBBLED THE ADMINISTRATION  BUT THE STRATEGY FRUSTRATED THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL  DONALD F  MCGAHN II  AND SOME IN THE WEST WING WHO SAID MR  COBB WAS TOO WILLING TO ACCEDE TO MR  MUELLERS REQUESTS COBBS RADICAL THEORY OF THE CASE  TO WAIVE EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING  WAS NOT SIMPLY WRONG  IT WAS RECKLESS  SAID STEPHEN K  BANNON  THE FORMER WHITE HOUSE STRATEGIST  HE SAID THAT MR  COBB HAD BEEN FIRED  RATHER THAN LEFT  AFTER REPEATEDLY PREDICTING THE END OF AN INVESTIGATION THAT NEVER CAME  UNFORTUNATELY  YOU CANNOT UNDO THE SERIOUS DAMAGE HE HAS CAUSED THE PRESIDENT AND THE PRESIDENCY MR  COBB RESPONDED  I DONT PAY ATTENTION TO STEVE BANNON  IVE SEEN ALL HIS DOCUMENTS MR  FLOOD IS JOINING A LEGAL TEAM THAT HAS FACED UPHEAVAL AT A CRITICAL MOMENT  MR  MUELLER WANTS TO INTERVIEW MR  TRUMP ABOUT HIS CAMPAIGNS TIES TO RUSSIA DURING THE 2016 ELECTION AND WHAT HE KNEW ABOUT MOSCOWS EFFORTS TO MEDDLE IN THE ELECTION  MR  TRUMP HAS SAID HE IS EAGER TO MEET WITH PROSECUTORS  BUT MANY OF MR  TRUMPS ADVISERS BELIEVE THAT IS A PERILOUS DECISION  IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER MR  FLOOD AGREES  AND IF HE IS WILLING TO FIGHT IN COURT TO KEEP MR  TRUMP FROM ANSWERING QUESTIONS MR  TRUMPS DECISION TO HIRE MR  FLOOD HAS BEEN IN THE WORKS FOR MONTHS  AFTER THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED IN MARCH THAT HE HAD INTERVIEWED FOR THE JOB  MR  TRUMP ISSUED AN ANGRY DENIAL  ATTACKING THE ARTICLE AND ONE OF THE REPORTERS WHO WROTE IT  AND HE OFFERED SUPPORT FOR THE THREE LAWYERS ON HIS TEAM  JOHN DOWD  JAY SEKULOW AND MR  COBB MR  DOWD QUIT SHORTLY AFTER AND MR  COBB HAS NOW BEEN REPLACED  A LEVEL OF TURNOVER THAT IS BUT ONE MEASURE OF THE CHALLENGES OF REPRESENTING A CLIENT WHO IS SUPREMELY CONFIDENT AND WILLING TO DISREGARD ADVICE  RUDOLPH W  GIULIANI  THE FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK WHO IS A LONGTIME CONFIDANT OF THE PRESIDENTS  HAS COME ON BOARD  PLEDGING TO NEGOTIATE AN INTERVIEW FOR MR  TRUMP WITH THE SPECIAL COUNSEL IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW  MR  GIULIANI SAID THAT MR  MUELLER HAD NO AUTHORITY TO SUBPOENA THE PRESIDENT  AN ARGUMENT THAT APPEARED TO SIGNAL A COMBATIVE APPROACH  BUT HE ALSO DID NOT FORECLOSE THE IDEA OF AN INTERVIEW  AS LONG AS THE TOPICS WERE LIMITED AND THE DISCUSSION DID NOT LAST MORE THAN TWO AND A HALF HOURS  HE OBJECTED TO SOME OF MR  MUELLERS PROPOSED QUESTIONS AS AMATEUR PSYCHIATRY HOW THE HELL CAN SOMEONE REMEMBER WHAT THEY WERE FEELING TWO YEARS AGO  MR  GIULIANI SAID  HE ADDED THAT HE DID NOT FORCE MR  COBB FROM OFFICE IT WAS TIME TO MAKE A CHANGE  MR  GIULIANI SAID  AND THE NEW GUY  EMMET  WILL ADD A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE  HAVING BEEN INVOLVED IN REPRESENTING PRESIDENT CLINTON MR  TRUMP SIGNALED HIS OWN IMPATIENCE WITH THE INQUIRY ON WEDNESDAY EVENING  SAYING ON TWITTER THAT HE WAS TOO OCCUPIED WITH THE DEMANDS OF THE OFFICE TO DEVOTE MUCH TIME TO BE THINKING ABOUT THIS  ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE WAS NO RUSSIAN COLLUSION THE ADDITION OF MR  FLOOD WAS SPEARHEADED BY MR  MCGAHN  HE AND HIS PERSONAL LAWYER  WILLIAM A  BURCK  HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH MR  FLOOD AND PERSUADED HIM OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS TO JOIN THE ADMINISTRATION  MR  FLOOD IS SEEN AS A POSSIBLE EVENTUAL REPLACEMENT FOR MR  MCGAHN  WHO HAS CLASHED PRIVATELY WITH MR  TRUMP AND WHOSE DEPARTURE HAS LONG BEEN RUMORED MR  FLOOD IS ARRIVING FROM THE WASHINGTON LAW FIRM WILLIAMS   CONNOLLY  WHICH SPECIALIZES IN TRIAL WORK  PARTICULARLY IN HIGH PROFILE CASES  AMONG ITS CLIENTS ARE HILLARY CLINTON  WHO RELIED ON THE FIRM DURING THE F B I  INVESTIGATION INTO HER USE OF A PRIVATE EMAIL SERVER  MR  TRUMP CAMPAIGNED TO CHEERS OF LOCK HER UP  AND HAS SAID THAT MRS  CLINTON SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHARGED IN THAT CASE WE ARE DISAPPOINTED TO LOSE HIM TO THE WHITE HOUSE  BUT WE FULLY APPRECIATE EMMETS STRONG COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC SERVICE  THE FIRMS CHAIRMAN  DANE BUTSWINKAS  SAID IN A STATEMENT  THE WHITE HOUSE WILL BE FORTUNATE TO HAVE HIS EXPERIENCED COUNSEL THERE IS ONE AREA WHERE MR  FLOODS VIEWS ARE UNCLEAR  WHETHER THE PRESIDENT CAN OR SHOULD FIRE MR  MUELLER  MR  COBB ADAMANTLY OPPOSED SUCH A MOVE  THERE IS NOT AND WILL NOT BE ANY CONSIDERATION OF TERMINATING THE SPECIAL COUNSEL  HE SAID IN OCTOBER MR  COBBS PROMISES OF A SWIFT END TO THE INVESTIGATION INITIALLY SOOTHED MR  TRUMP  BUT AS THE INQUIRY DRAGGED ON  MR  TRUMP BEGAN OPENLY FLIRTING WITH THE IDEA OF FIRING MR  MUELLER  AND PERHAPS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND HIS DEPUTY  AS WELL ULTIMATELY  IT WAS MR  COBB WHOSE DEPARTURE WAS ANNOUNCED

20180501,business,business,10,DURHAM  N C   DOWNTOWN JUST AINT BLACK ENOUGH FOR ME  PAUL SCOTT WROTE IN THE DURHAM HERALD SUN A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO  A MINISTER AND LOCAL NEWSPAPER COLUMNIST  MR  SCOTT WAS ECHOING A SENTIMENT VOICED BY MANY OF THE CITYS LONGTIME AFRICAN AMERICAN RESIDENTS  THE CITY CENTER DOES NOT FEEL WELCOMING TO THEM ANYMORE MY CONCERN IS THAT WHEN YOU GO DOWNTOWN ON ANY GIVEN EVENING OR ON A WEEKEND  YOU DONT SEE A WHOLE LOT OF BLACK FACES THERE  MR  SCOTT SAID LATER IN AN INTERVIEW THIS CITY HAS SEEN AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF CHANGE OVER THE PAST DECADE  ITS CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT HAS GONE FROM EMPTY AND LACKING INVESTMENT TO THRIVING  AND MORE DEVELOPMENT IS ON THE WAY AS A RESULT OF THE GROWTH  LOCAL OFFICIALS FIND THEMSELVES GRAPPLING WITH A CRISIS OVER AFFORDABLE HOUSING  BUT WHAT HAS BEEN LARGELY OVERLOOKED IS THE CULTURAL DISPLACEMENT THAT CAN ACCOMPANY RAPID URBAN CHANGE  THE SENSE THAT HOME IS NOT HOME ANYMORE  AT LEAST FOR A PORTION OF THE POPULATION IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT SOME DURHAM RESIDENTS ARE FEELING DISORIENTED  IN THE EARLY PART OF THE LAST CENTURY  THE CITY  ONCE A HUB FOR TOBACCO AND TEXTILE INDUSTRIES  WAS NATIONALLY KNOWN FOR ITS STRONG BUSINESSES OWNED BY AFRICAN AMERICANS  IT WENT BY THE MONIKER CAPITAL OF THE BLACK MIDDLE CLASS  AND THAT GROUP SURVIVED EVEN AS THE CITYS DOWNTOWN EXPERIENCED A POPULATION SHIFT TO THE SUBURBS  BY THE 1970S  THOUGH  DURHAM WAS THE POOREST OF THE THREE MAIN MUNICIPALITIES IN THE REGION  WHICH INCLUDES CHAPEL HILL AND RALEIGH  AND IT HAD DEVELOPED A REPUTATION FOR CRIME BUT PUBLIC PRIVATE INVESTMENTS JUMP STARTED SOME GROWTH A FEW YEARS AGO  JUST IN TIME FOR THE GROWING INTEREST IN URBAN LIVING  ARTISTS  PROFESSIONALS AND YOUNG FAMILIES BEGAN FLOCKING TO DURHAM  ATTRACTED TO ITS LOW HOUSING PRICES AND DOWNTOWN INFRASTRUCTURE  A BIG PART OF THE APPEAL  TOO  WAS THE CITYS RACIAL DIVERSITY  BLACKS AND WHITES EACH MAKE UP ABOUT 40 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION SINCE THEN  HOWEVER  HOUSING PRICES HAVE SKYROCKETED  INVESTORS ARE RENOVATING HOMES IN LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS NEAR THE CENTER OF TOWN AND SELLING THEM FOR SEVERAL TIMES WHAT THEY INITIALLY PAID  TOBACCO WAREHOUSES AND TEXTILE MILLS HAVE BECOME UPSCALE CONDOMINIUM AND OFFICE BUILDINGS NOW  DURHAM IS ON THE CUSP OF MAJOR NEW DEVELOPMENT  ONE OF THE BIGGEST IS ONE CITY CENTER  AN  MILLION PROJECT BY AUSTIN LAWRENCE PARTNERS  A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT FIRM BASED IN ASPEN  COLO  THE BUILDING WILL RISE 27 STORIES ABOVE DOWNTOWN AND OFFER RETAIL SPACE  OFFICES AND HIGH END RESIDENCES AND THERE ARE MANY OTHERS  INCLUDING THE DURHAM INNOVATION DISTRICT  A  MILLION PROJECT BY LONGFELLOW REAL ESTATE PARTNERS  A DEVELOPER BASED IN BOSTON  THE PROJECT CONSISTS OF 350 000 SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE AND LABORATORY SPACE  WITH GROUND FLOOR RETAIL  IN TWO SEVEN STORY BUILDINGS  ONE HAS ALREADY BEEN LEASED TO THE DUKE CLINICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE  THE BUILDINGS ARE ALMOST COMPLETE  AND EVENTUALLY THE PROJECT WILL ALSO INCLUDE A TOWER DEVOTED TO LAB SPACE  BRINGING THE DEVELOPMENT TO 900 000 SQUARE FEET NORTHWOOD RAVIN  A DEVELOPER BASED IN NORTH CAROLINA  IS BUILDING TWO PROJECTS JUST SOUTH OF DOWNTOWN  THE VAN ALEN  AN  MILLION  12 STORY BUILDING THAT WILL HOLD ROUGHLY 400 RESIDENTIAL UNITS  AND 555 MANGUM  AN 11 STORY  240 000 SQUARE FOOT OFFICE TOWER WITH GROUND FLOOR RETAIL IN TOTAL  THE PROJECTS WILL BRING MORE THAN 1 2 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE SPACE  1 500 RESIDENTIAL UNITS AND 100 000 SQUARE FEET OF RETAIL SPACE TO DURHAM THERE ARE ALREADY FAR MORE PEOPLE ON MAIN STREET HERE THAN THERE HAVE BEEN IN SEVERAL DECADES  AND THAT NUMBER WILL SOON INCREASE IMMENSELY  IN PARTICULAR  THE ADDITION OF SO MANY UPSCALE RESIDENTIAL UNITS MEANS AN ENTIRELY NEW POPULATION DOWNTOWN  LARGELY WEALTHY AND WHITE  PLUS NEW RESTAURANTS AND SERVICES CATERING TO THAT DEMOGRAPHIC BUT THE GROWTH IS MAKING SOME LONGTIME RESIDENTS UNCOMFORTABLE IVE NOTICED A LOT OF CHANGES  BUT NONE OF THEM HAVE TRULY BEEN FOR BLACK PEOPLE  IN MY OPINION  SAID VANESSA EVANS  A COMMUNITY LEADER IN THE BRAGGTOWN AREA OF DURHAM WHOSE FAMILY HAS LIVED IN THE CITY FOR GENERATIONS  DOWNTOWN DOESNT LOOK ANYTHING LIKE ME  OR LIKE IT USED TO LOOK COMMUNITY LEADERS POINT OUT THAT SEVERAL AFRICAN AMERICAN EVENTS  LIKE THE POPULAR BIMB CULTURAL ARTS FESTIVAL  HAVE BEEN MOVED TO THE CITYS OUTER FRINGES  OTHERS SAY THAT DURHAMS DIVERSITY IS STILL USED AS A SELLING POINT  BUT THAT THE CONCEPT OF WHATS CONSIDERED HIP IN THE CITY HAS BEGUN TO SHIFT WHAT MADE DURHAM COOL WAS THE RACIAL MIX  SAID DORIAN BOLDEN  OWNER OF BEYU CAFFE  A DOWNTOWN RESTAURANT  WHAT CREATED THE SPARK IS BEING REDEFINED AS A DIFFERENT KIND OF COOL THAT MAY NOT HAVE THE SAME RACIAL INCLUSION THAT WE ALL FELL IN LOVE WITH AT THE BEGINNING LONGTIME

DEVICES  THIS MARKET WILL TREND TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE MOST MONEY TO SPEND  IN ORDER TO MAKE DOWNTOWN ACCESSIBLE AND COMFORTABLE  THERE HAS TO BE MORE OF AN INTENTIONAL PUSH TO MAINTAIN SOME OF

IMPORTANT FOR THE CITY TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE IN ALL OF ITS LAND USE DECISIONS  PARTICULARLY WITH BIG PARCELS  SHE ADDED  BECAUSE THAT CAN HELP HEAD OFF DISAGREEMENTS AND THE SENSE OF BEING

20180502,business,market,6,WASHINGTON  TOP TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS ARE ARRIVING IN CHINA THIS WEEK ARMED WITH TOUGH TALK ABOUT BEIJINGS NEED TO CHANGE ITS TRADE PRACTICES  BUT WITHIN THE UNITED STATES DELEGATION THERE IS LITTLE CONSENSUS ABOUT WHAT CONCESSIONS AMERICA SHOULD TRY TO EXTRACT  OR THE BEST APPROACH TO GETTING THE CHINESE TO AGREE INSTEAD OF A SINGLE POINT PERSON WITH A CLEAR SET OF DEMANDS  THE WHITE HOUSE IS SENDING SIX TRADE AND ECONOMIC OFFICIALS WITH DIFFERING IDEAS ON HOW TO APPROACH CHINA AND WHO ARE DEEPLY DIVIDED OVER THE DESIRABILITY OF A TRADE WAR  SOME ADVOCATE GOALS THAT DO NOT ALIGN WITH WHAT THE AMERICAN BUSINESS COMMUNITY WANTS OR WHAT CHINA IS PREPARED TO OFFER  RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW PRODUCTIVE A DIALOGUE WILL BE  AND WHETHER TALKS CAN PREVENT THE WORLDS TWO LARGEST ECONOMIES FROM TIPPING INTO A DEEPER CONFLICT WHAT UNITES THE GROUP IS A VIEW THAT CHINAS TRADE PRACTICES ARE UNACCEPTABLE AND THAT WASHINGTON WILL NOW CALL THE SHOTS THE DISCUSSIONS WILL TAKE PLACE IN BEIJING  THE DECISIONS WILL TAKE PLACE IN WASHINGTON  SAID PETER NAVARRO  A TOP TRADE ADVISER AND LONGTIME CHINA CRITIC WHO IS AMONG THOSE TRAVELING TO BEIJING CHINA EXPERTS HAVE SAID THE TRIP IS VERY LIKELY TO BE MORE OF A LISTENING SESSION  IN WHICH ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS WILL WAIT TO HEAR WHAT THE CHINESE WILL OFFER  BUT WITHOUT AGREEMENT OR A CLEAR LIST OF GOALS FROM THE AMERICAN SIDE  THE CHINESE MAY TRY TO MOLLIFY OFFICIALS BY MEETING ONLY THE MOST MODEST OF THEIR TRADE DEMANDS  THAT COULD INCLUDE AGREEING TO BUY ADDITIONAL AMERICAN PRODUCTS TO LOWER THE TRADE SURPLUS WITH THE UNITED STATES  REVIVING OLD ECONOMIC DIALOGUES BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES  OR CRACKING OPEN SOME DOMESTIC MARKETS TO FOREIGN COMPETITION  BUT ONLY THOSE WHERE CHINESE COMPANIES ARE ALREADY SECURELY DOMINANT IN GENERAL  CHINA APPEARS SET TO TAKE A HARD LINE  CHINESE OFFICIALS SAID THEY WOULD NOT AGREE TO A  BILLION REDUCTION IN THE TRADE DEFICIT THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS DEMANDED  AND THEY DO NOT PLAN TO ENGAGE ON AMBITIOUS UNITED STATES DEMANDS TO CURB AN INDUSTRIAL PLAN KNOWN AS MADE IN CHINA 2025 THE DELEGATION ALSO INCLUDES ROBERT LIGHTHIZER  THE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE  WHO  LIKE MR  NAVARRO  EMBRACES A MORE COMBATIVE APPROACH TO DEALING WITH CHINA THAN OTHER ADVISERS ON THE TRIP  MR  NAVARRO AND MR  LIGHTHIZER HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON CHINAS TRADE PRACTICES FOR DECADES  AND INSIST THE COUNTRY MUST MAKE MORE DRAMATIC CHANGES TO EVEN THE PLAYING FIELD FOR AMERICAN COMPANIES  THEY ALSO APPEAR WILLING TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE TARIFFS PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS THREATENED  DESPITE THE PAIN IT COULD INFLICT ON MANY AMERICAN BUSINESSES AND WORKERS  IF THEY VIEW IT AS NECESSARY TO INCREASE THEIR LEVERAGE WITH THE CHINESE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE DELEGATION  INCLUDING TREASURY SECRETARY STEVEN MNUCHIN AND LARRY KUDLOW  WHO HEADS THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL  APPEAR MORE INCLINED TO STRIKE DEALS THAT WOULD ACCOMPLISH THE PRESIDENTS GOAL OF REDUCING THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT AMERICA IMPORTS FROM CHINA AND WHAT IT SELLS TO THE COUNTRY  AND THUS HEAD OFF THE RISK OF AN ESCALATING TRADE WAR  ALSO GOING ON THE TRIP ARE WILBUR ROSS  THE COMMERCE SECRETARY  WHO HAS PREVIOUSLY SEEMED RECEPTIVE TO STRIKING DEALS  EVERETT EISSENSTAT  AN EXPERIENCED TRADE ADVISER  AND TERRY BRANSTAD  THE UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO CHINA YUKON HUANG  A CHINA SCHOLAR AT THE CARNEGIE INSTITUTE  CALLED THE GROUP AN IDEOLOGICALLY HYBRID TEAM WITH COMPETING VIEWS ABOUT WHAT IS REALLY PLAGUING THE U S CHINA RELATIONSHIP ITS A MIXTURE BETWEEN TWO CAMPS  ONE FOCUSED ON TRADE ISSUES  ONE FOCUSED ON TECHNOLOGY WARS  MR  HUANG SAID  THE REASON IT IS SUCH  AND WE DONT HAVE A GAME PLAN  IS THE ISSUES ARENT WELL UNDERSTOOD AMONG THE CONCERNS ARE A RANGE OF PRACTICES  INCLUDING BARRIERS TO ENTRY  SUBSIDIES AND REGULATIONS THAT PRESSURE AMERICAN COMPANIES TO HAND OVER SENSITIVE TRADE SECRETS  WHICH CHINA USES TO MAKE NATIONAL CHAMPIONS OF ITS HOMEGROWN FIRMS  THESE TACTICS HAVE ENABLED THE CHINESE TO DOMINATE GLOBAL INDUSTRIES LIKE STEEL  ALUMINUM AND SOLAR PANELS  AND AMERICAN TRADE ADVISERS SAY THEY ARE CURRENTLY TIPPING THE PLAYING FIELD FOR INDUSTRIES OF THE FUTURE  INCLUDING SEMICONDUCTORS  ROBOTICS  CLOUD COMPUTING  ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND BIOTECHNOLOGY SPEAKING AT THE U S  CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN WASHINGTON ON TUESDAY  MR  LIGHTHIZER SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD NEARLY A THIRD OF THE WORLDS HIGH TECH BUSINESS  FOLLOWED BY CHINA  AND THAT CHINAS TRADE PRACTICES WERE IMPERILING THE ECONOMIC FUTURE OF THE UNITED STATES IM ALWAYS HOPING BUT NOT ALWAYS HOPEFUL  MR  LIGHTHIZER SAID ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF SUCCESS FROM THE TALKS MANY AMERICAN INDUSTRY LEADERS SUPPORT MR  LIGHTHIZERS EFFORTS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO CHINESE SECTORS THAT ARE RESTRICTED TO AMERICAN COMPANIES AND PROTECT AMERICAN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FROM THEFT AND COERCION  LONGSTANDING COMPLAINTS OF AMERICAN BUSINESS LEADERS ABOUT CHINAS TACTICS  BUT THEY ARE WARY OF THE ADMINISTRATIONS APPROACH TO RESOLVING LONGSTANDING PROBLEMS SOME BUSINESS LEADERS FEAR THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MAY SIMPLY ACCEPT CHINESE OFFERS TO LOWER THE TRADE SURPLUS BY BUYING MORE AMERICAN GOODS AND OPEN UP SEGMENTS OF THE ECONOMY THAT ARE ALREADY MATURE  LIKE FINANCIAL SERVICES  ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS OR THE AUTO SECTOR  ON THE OTHER HAND  THEY WORRY ABOUT THE ECONOMIC DAMAGE FROM A TRADE WAR IF THE ANTI CHINA WING OF THE DELEGATION WINS THE INTERNAL DEBATE AND FOLLOWS THROUGH WITH ITS THREATS THOMAS J  DONOHUE  THE PRESIDENT OF THE U S  CHAMBER OF COMMERCE  SAID TUESDAY THAT THERE WERE SERIOUS  GROWING AND LEGITIMATE CHALLENGES ABOUT CHINESE PRACTICES  BUT HE ALSO CAUTIONED AGAINST THE EFFECT OF A TIT FOR TAT TARIFF WAR WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT THE PROPOSED TARIFFS LIST AND ESCALATING TARIFF THREATS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT EFFECTIVELY ADVANCE OUR SHARED GOAL OF CHANGING THESE HARMFUL CHINESE PRACTICES  HE SAID ANALYSTS CONTINUE TO WARN OF POTENTIAL RISKS TO ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE UNITED STATES IF ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS CANNOT NEGOTIATE A QUICK RESOLUTION WITH THE CHINESE  AND THE TARIFFS GO INTO EFFECT  ANALYSTS AT GOLDMAN SACHS SAID IN A RESEARCH NOTE THIS WEEK THAT NEW INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS ON CHINA  WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO OUTLINE SOON  COULD ALSO RATTLE INVESTORS SOME ADDITIONAL MARKET DISRUPTIVE POLICY MOVES REGARDING U S CHINA TRADE SEEM LIKELY  GOLDMANS ALEC PHILLIPS WROTE IN THE RESEARCH NOTE  WHICH PLAYED DOWN THE ODDS OF SUCCESS IN THIS WEEKS TALKS  WE BELIEVE A SUBSTANTIAL BREAKTHROUGH AT THIS MEETING IS UNLIKELY AS THE ISSUES THE U S  HAS RAISED  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POLICIES  TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER  AND THE MADE IN CHINA 2025 STRATEGY  IN PARTICULAR  ARE NOT THE TYPE OF TECHNICAL TRADE ISSUES THAT CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS  ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL BUSINESS LOBBYING GROUPS IN WASHINGTON  HAS BEEN PRESSING MR  TRUMP AND HIS ECONOMIC TEAM TO OPEN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE CHINESE ON A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT  AN AMBITIOUS MOVE THAT MANY TRADE EXPERTS DOUBT WOULD BEAR FRUIT  GIVEN THE PAST STRUGGLES OF AMERICAN NEGOTIATORS WHO HAVE TRIED TO SECURE FAR MORE LIMITED AGREEMENTS WITH CHINA JAY TIMMONS  THE PRESIDENT OF THE MANUFACTURERS GROUP  URGED MR  TRUMP IN A LETTER THIS YEAR TO CONSIDER PURSUING A TRULY MODERN  INNOVATIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT WITH CHINA THAT WHOLLY RESTRUCTURES OUR ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP  THE GROUPS VICE PRESIDENT FOR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AFFAIRS  LINDA MENGHETTI DEMPSEY  TOLD A CONGRESSIONAL SUBCOMMITTEE IN APRIL THAT SUCH AN EFFORT WOULD BE AT ONCE BOTH A RADICAL IDEA AND  IN OUR ESTIMATION  THE MOST PRAGMATIC AND EFFECTIVE WAY FORWARD ON TRADE WITH CHINA THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ATTEMPTED TO NEGOTIATE A MORE LIMITED AGREEMENT WITH CHINA  A BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY  BUT COULD NOT FINALIZE THE DEAL BEFORE MR  TRUMP TOOK OFFICE  HIS TEAM HAS NOT YET REVIVED THE TALKS MANUFACTURERS HAVE DISCUSSED THE PLAN DIRECTLY WITH MR  KUDLOW AND WITH VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE  PROPONENTS SAY THEY BELIEVE THE IDEA COULD APPEAL TO MR  TRUMPS PREFERENCE FOR BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENTS AND HIS CONFIDENCE IN HIS NEGOTIATION SKILLS HOWEVER  WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS HAVE GIVEN NO PUBLIC INDICATION THAT THEY ARE CONSIDERING SUCH A NEGOTIATION  MR  LIGHTHIZER  MR  NAVARRO AND OTHER PROPONENTS OF A HARDER LINE AGAINST CHINA HAVE ARGUED THAT THE CHINESE TEND TO USE SUCH DIALOGUES AS A DELAYING TACTIC  AND THAT PAST TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THEM HAVE NOT BEEN PRODUCTIVE
20180504,sports,hockey,10,ATLANTA  THIS IS NOT A RANT AGAINST CHEERLEADING THAT S A LEGITIMATE SPORT  PLAYED BY ELITE ATHLETES  MEN AND WOMEN  WHO ARE WORTHY OF ADMIRATION FOR THEIR DARING AND SKILL THERE MIGHT EVEN COME A DAY WHEN CHEERLEADERS ARE COMPETING FOR GOLD  SILVER AND BRONZE AT THE OLYMPICS NONE OF WHICH HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT HAPPENS ON THE SIDELINES OF AN NFL OR NBA GAME THOSE ARE SCANTILY CLAD PERFORMERS OFTEN LEERED AT BY FANS  OR  AS WE RE LEARNING  PERHAPS EVEN WORSE THE  METOO ERA IS THE PERFECT TIME TO RETIRE THESE OBJECTIFIED  CHAUVINISTIC RELICS  AND  WHILE WE RE AT IT  DITTO FOR THE BARELY CLOTHED WOMEN WHO CLIMB INTO THE RING TO TELL US WHAT ROUND IT IS AT BOXING AND MMA EVENTS THERE IS A MISCONCEPTION THAT CHEERLEADING IS JUST SIDELINE DANCING  THIS COULD NOT BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH  SAID SAVANNAH PARROT  AN 11TH GRADE CHEERLEADER AT NIWOT HIGH SCHOOL IN COLORADO   CHEERLEADERS ARE ATHLETES  WE COMPETE IN LOCAL  STATE  NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION AND ARE EVALUATED ON THE DIFFICULTY OF OUR ROUTINES INCLUDING ADVANCED TUMBLING PASSES AND INTRICATE STUNT SEQUENCES IF THE NFL AND NBA WANTED TO HAVE CHEERLEADERS  SHE WENT ON TO SAY  WISE BEYOND HER YEARS   I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT QUALIFIED ATHLETES WOULD BE HONORED TO REPRESENT OUR SPORT THAT S NOT WHAT THE NFL AND NBA WANT  OF COURSE THEY RE LOOKING FOR ATTRACTIVE DANCERS SHOWING LOTS OF SKIN  APPARENTLY IN THE BELIEF THAT SEX IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO KEEP FANS ENTERTAINED BEYOND THE PRODUCT ON THE FIELD OR COURT AND  ACCORDING TO A REPORT BY THE NEW YORK TIMES   CHEERLEADERS FROM WASHINGTON S NFL TEAM WERE FORCED TO PLAY AN EVEN SEEDIER ROLE BEHIND THE SCENES DURING A 2013 TRIP TO COSTA RICA  THEY ALLEGE THEIR PASSPORTS WERE COLLECTED  THEY WERE ASKED TO GO TOPLESS FOR A CALENDAR PHOTO SHOOT THAT INCLUDED MALE SPECTATORS  AND THEY SERVED AS ESCORTS FOR SPONSORS AT A NIGHTCLUB  THE CHEERLEADERS QUOTED IN THE REPORT SPOKE ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY BECAUSE THEY SIGNED CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS THE TEAM SAID IT S CONCERNED BY THE ALLEGATIONS AND CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION  BUT WE ALL KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING  ALREADY  TEAM PRESIDENT BRUCE ALLEN SAID MANY CURRENT AND FORMER CHEERLEADERS ARE CONTRADICTING ALLEGATIONS IN THE REPORT AT LEAST THE NBA HAD THE GOOD SENSE TO BREAK FROM ANY PRETENSE THAT THESE ARE CHEERLEADERS  ADORNING THEIR GROUPS WITH NAMES SUCH AS THE KNICKS CITY DANCERS AND MEMPHIS GRIZZ GIRLS  THESE ARE DANCE GROUPS  PURE AND SIMPLE  OFTEN PERFORMING SEX TINGED ROUTINES THAT ARE A FOCAL POINT OF THE BETWEEN GAME ENTERTAINMENT IN THE NFL  THE DANCERS PLAY A LESS PROMINENT ROLE  THE STADIUMS  AFTER ALL  ARE MUCH LARGER  BUT THEY RE STILL PASSED OFF AS CHEERLEADERS  FOR NO APPARENT REASON  THEY ARE CERTAINLY NOT THERE TO LEAD CHEERS  THEIR MAIN PURPOSE SEEMS TO BE WIGGLING AROUND AS PROVOCATIVELY AS POSSIBLE FOR THE MEN IN THE CROWD  ALL WHILE IGNORING HOW MANY WOMEN ARE NOW IN THE STANDS THIS NOT SO PROUD TRADITION CAN LARGELY BE TRACED TO THE DALLAS COWBOYS CHEERLEADERS BECOMING CULTURAL ICONS IN THE 1970S  THOUGH IT S WORTH NOTING THAT VENERABLE FRANCHISES SUCH AS THE GREEN BAY PACKERS  NEW YORK GIANTS AND PITTSBURGH STEELERS DON T HAVE CHEERLEADING SQUADS IT DOESN T SEEM TO HAVE HURT THEIR POPULARITY OR SUCCESS ON THE FIELD IT IS WAY PAST TIME FOR THE NFL AND NBA TO GET RID OF CHEERLEADERS  SAID JEFFREY MCCALL  A PROFESSOR OF MEDIA STUDIES AT DEPAUW UNIVERSITY IN INDIANA   OTHER PRO SPORTS SUCH AS HOCKEY AND BASEBALL SEEM TO MANAGE WITHOUT THINLY CLAD WOMEN AS PART OF THE GAME DAY EXPERIENCE THESE FAUX CHEERLEADERS LOOK INCREASINGLY ARCHAIC WHEN SO MANY WOMEN ARE STEPPING FORWARD TO SAY ENOUGH S ENOUGH GIVEN TODAY S CONCERNS ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE  THE NFL AND NBA CLEARLY HAVE TIN EARS IN THIS MATTER  MCCALL SAID   CHEERLEADERS AT PRO GAMES DON T REALLY CHEER AND INSPIRE FANS OR PLAYERS ANYWAY  THEY ARE SIMPLY ORNAMENTS THAT SHOULD BE OFFENSIVE TO ALL OF US  BUT ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE ACTUAL CHEERLEADERS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ATHLETES PARTICIPATE IN THIS RAPIDLY GROWING SPORT AT COMPETITIONS AROUND THE UNITED STATES  WHICH PROMPTED DISNEY TO BUILD A NEW 8 000 SEAT ARENA AT ITS WIDE WORLD OF SPORTS COMPLEX IN FLORIDA FOR THOSE TYPES OF EVENTS IN 2016  THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE EVEN RECOGNIZED CHEERLEADING AS A PROVISIONAL SPORT   THE FIRST STEP TOWARD POSSIBLY CLAIMING A SPOT AT THE SUMMER GAMES OF COURSE  CHEERLEADING ALSO SERVES AS A COMPLEMENT TO SPORTS SUCH AS FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL THAT S JUST FINE  TOO IT IS CALLED CHEERLEADING BECAUSE THEIR ROLE IS TO LEAD THE CROWD IN CHEERING FOR THE TEAM  SAID SHAUNA MACDONALD  ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE GENDER   WOMEN STUDIES PROGRAM AT VILLANOVA UNIVERSITY   THIS  I THINK  CAN STILL BE A POSITIVE AND INTERESTING PURPOSE  CHEERING IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF SPORT  ESPECIALLY IN NORTH AMERICA  AND HAVING PEOPLE TO PEP UP THE CROWD AND LEAD THE CHEERS IS A GOOD THING WE KNOW THAT THIS DOESN T REQUIRE CHEERLEADING TO LOOK EXACTLY AS IT DOES  BECAUSE BANDS AND PEP SQUADS ALSO SERVE IN THESE ROLES  IN ORDER FOR THE CULTURE OF CHEERLEADING TO CHANGE  HOWEVER  THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME SWEEPING CULTURAL SHIFTS THERE S NO SIGN OF IT HAPPENING IN THE NFL OR NBA TIME S UP FOR CHEERLEADERS OR DANCERS OF WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THEM PAUL NEWBERRY IS A SPORTS COLUMNIST FOR THE

20180507,business,business,5,TEHRAN  IRAN  ON THE STREETS OF TEHRAN  EVERY DAY SEEMS TO BRING MORE WORRY AND FEAR AHEAD OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP S DECISION THIS WEEK ON WHETHER TO PULL AMERICA OUT OF THE NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN EXCHANGE SHOP WINDOWS THAT ONCE SHOWED RATES FOR IRANIAN RIAL TO U S  DOLLAR TRANSACTIONS HAVE GONE BLANK  AS BLACK MARKET RATES HAVE SKYROCKETED TO 70 000 RIALS TO THE DOLLAR  FAR HIGHER THAN THE NEWLY GOVERNMENT IMPOSED RATE OF 42 000 FOR  BUSY SHOPPING DISTRICTS THAT ONCE SAW NEWLYWEDS BUYING REFRIGERATORS AND OTHER MAJOR APPLIANCES NOW LARGELY STAND EMPTY AS PEOPLE SAVE THEIR MONEY  SOME TALK OPENLY ABOUT LEAVING THE COUNTRY FOR ANYWHERE ELSE ALL OF US ARE THINKING ABOUT THE UNCERTAIN FUTURE AHEAD OF US  SAID MOHAMMAD KHALEGHI  A 27 YEAR OLD APPLIANCE SALESMAN ON TEHRAN S AMIN HOZOUR STREET   EVERYBODY IS DOING THAT  EVERYBODY IS AFRAID OF THE FUTURE  EVEN MYSELF  I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN  IF I CAN SURVIVE IN THIS BUSINESS OR NOT  THIS SITUATION CONCERNS US ALL THE SENSE OF FOREBODING GRIPPING THE IRANIAN CAPITAL AHEAD OF TRUMP S SATURDAY DEADLINE TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE DEAL IS A FAR CRY FROM THE JUBILANT STREET CELEBRATIONS THAT GREETED THE 2015 NUCLEAR ACCORD WITH WORLD POWERS  THEN  PEOPLE SPOKE WITH HOPE ABOUT IRAN SLOWLY LOSING ITS PARIAH STATUS WITH THE WEST  CEMENTED IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE 1979 ISLAMIC REVOLUTION AND THE HOSTAGE CRISIS AT THE U S  EMBASSY IN TEHRAN  OTHERS PRAISED PRESIDENT HASSAN ROUHANI  HIMSELF A CLERIC  AND IRAN S OTHER RELATIVE MODERATES FOR LIFTING THE CRIPPLING ECONOMIC SANCTIONS THAT CHOKED IRAN OVER ITS CONTESTED NUCLEAR PROGRAM TODAY THOUGH  FEW CAN POINT TO ANY BENEFIT OF THE ATOMIC ACCORD WE DO NOT FEEL ANY PARTICULAR IMPACT ESPECIALLY IN OUR ECONOMY OR ON OUR LIFE  SAID SHADI GHOLAMI  A 25 YEAR OLD ARCHITECT   IT IS AS IF SUCH A DEAL DOES NOT EXIST AT ALL WHILE THE NUCLEAR DEAL OFFERED A SALVE IN ALLOWING IRAN TO SELL CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET  THE DEAL HAS NOT HELPED ADDRESS ITS HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT  PARTICULARLY AMONG THE YOUTH IN THIS COUNTRY OF 80 MILLION PEOPLE  BANKS REMAIN SADDLED WITH MASSIVE BAD LOANS FROM THE SANCTIONS ERA  GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION ALSO REMAINS OUR ECONOMIC PROBLEMS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DEAL OR TRUMP  OUR PROBLEM IS THAT OUR OFFICIALS JUST THINK OF THEIR OWN POCKET  SAID LADAN SHIRI  A 33 YEAR OLD SALES MANAGER AT A PRIVATE COMPANY   IF THEY REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THE PEOPLE AND NOT JUST THEIR OWN PROFITS  OUR PEOPLE WOULD NOT HAVE THE TROUBLES THEY HAVE TODAY  THIS IS THE MAIN PROBLEM ALI FOROUZI  A 33 YEAR OLD INDUSTRIAL ENGINEER  AGREES IT IS NOT NICE TO ALWAYS BLAME OTHERS SUCH AS AMERICA AND TRUMP FOR OUR TROUBLES  I BELIEVE THAT THE ROOT OF OUR PROBLEMS IS INSIDE THE COUNTRY  FOROUZI SAID   IF WE ARE STRONG ENOUGH INTERNALLY  NOBODY CAN HIT US FROM THE OUTSIDE  BUT UNFORTUNATELY OUR PROBLEMS ARISE FROM THE INTERNAL SYSTEM  THIS INCLUDES THE LACK OF GOOD COORDINATION BETWEEN OUR GOVERNMENT AND OTHER BODIES  AS WELL AS WITHIN THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES TRUMP HIMSELF HAS BEEN A DIVISIVE FIGURE IN IRAN EVEN APART FROM HIS LONG CRITICISM OF THE NUCLEAR DEAL  THOUGH THE UNITED STATES IS HOME TO MANY IRANIANS  TRUMP INCLUDED IRAN IN HIS TRAVEL BANS  STOPPING FAMILIES FROM GETTING VISAS TO VISIT LOVED ONES  IRANIANS ALSO HAVE CRITICIZED HIM FOR CALLING THE PERSIAN GULF  THE ARABIAN GULF TRUMP S ACTIONS HAVE BEEN A BOON TO HARD LINERS WITHIN IRAN S GOVERNMENT  WHO POINT TO THEM AS A SIGN THAT AMERICA IS THE  GREAT SATAN  OF THE POST REVOLUTION YEARS IF TRUMP PULLS OUT  IT WILL SHOW VERY WELL TO THE WORLD AND TO OUR OWN PEOPLE HOW DISLOYAL AMERICA IS TO ITS TREATIES AND THE TRUTH WILL BE REVEALED  FOROUZI SAID   IT MAY EVEN GIVE A BETTER PICTURE OF US INTERNATIONALLY BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO OUR PROMISES SEYED REZA MOUSAVI  A 58 YEAR OLD SHIITE CLERIC  SAID THE DEAL HAD  DISARMED SUPERPOWERS  AND SHOWED IRAN S STRENGTH WE ARE NOT SCARED BY TRUMP S DECISION AND WILL RESIST AND STAND UP TO HIM WITHOUT WAVERING  THE CLERIC SAID   EVEN IF HE PULLS OUT OF THE DEAL WE WILL NOT BE HARMED  WE HAVE CHOSEN OUR PATH AND IT IS THE UNITED STATES THAT WILL BE HARMED  NOT US  IF HE DOES IT ONE WAY THE U S  COULD BE HARMED IS IN NORTH KOREA  SAID ALIREZA YARMOHAMMADI  THE 52 YEAR OLD DIRECTOR OF A HEALTH CARE AND COSMETICS COMPANY  NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG UN MAY NEVER TAKE TRUMP SERIOUSLY AHEAD OF PROMISED TALKS BETWEEN THE TWO LEADERS IT IS NOT VERY EASY FOR AMERICA TO LEAVE THE DEAL BECAUSE IF IT DOES  NORTH KOREA WILL NOT HOLD TALKS WITH IT  YARMOHAMMADI SAID   THEY WILL NOT REACH A DEAL WITH A COUNTRY THAT IS DISLOYAL TO ANOTHER ACCORD WHICH IS ONLY 2 YEARS OLD  BESIDES  THE NEXT PRESIDENT MAY COME AND SAY THAT THEY DO NOT ACCEPT A PREVIOUSLY REACHED DEAL BUT CLOSER TO HOME  IRANIANS INCREASINGLY TALK AMONG THEMSELVES OF TRYING TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY FOR A BETTER LIFE ABROAD  WESTERN EUROPE REMAINS A CHOICE FOR THOSE WITH TIES THERE  WHILE THOSE WITH THE MONEY HEAD VISA FREE TO ARMENIA  GEORGIA AND SERBIA TO BUY CITIZENSHIP OFTENTIMES I THINK THAT IF I WANT TO LIVE A BETTER LIFE I MUST EMIGRATE FROM IRAN  SAID GHOLAMI  THE ARCHITECT   THIS THOUGHT IS ALWAYS WITH ME SHE ADDED   I WISH HERE WAS A PLACE WHERE I COULD LIVE IN PEACE AND QUIET BESIDE MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY  BUT SOMETIMES THINGS BECOME SO BITTER THAT WE HAVE NO CHOICE THE AP S COVERAGE ON THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL
20180503,politics,trump,7,WHEN IT COMES TO ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT  ONE OF THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES IS THE EFFECT ON CONSUMER PRICES  SO THE ANTITRUST QUESTION OF THE MOMENT IS THIS  WILL COMBINING AT T WITH TIME WARNER OR SPRINT WITH T MOBILE SO DIMINISH COMPETITION THAT PRICES GO UP WHILE REGULATORS AND A FEDERAL JUDGE PONDER THAT QUESTION  THE GREAT DISRUPTER  AMAZON  IS ALREADY RAISING PRICES  LAST WEEK  IT SAID ITS AMAZON PRIME SERVICE  WHICH INCLUDES ITS EXTENSIVE VIDEO OFFERINGS ALONG WITH FREE SHIPPING AND OTHER BENEFITS  WOULD COST   A 20 PERCENT INCREASE FROM THE CURRENT  TO JUSTIFY THE MOVE  AMAZON CITED HIGHER COSTS AND THE FACT THAT ITS ONLY THE SECOND INCREASE SINCE IT INTRODUCED ITS PRIME SERVICE  FOR   IN 2005  STILL  AMAZONS MOVE SUGGESTS A DEGREE OF PRICING POWER THAT ITS ANXIOUS RIVALS CAN ONLY ENVY  AMAZON SAID IT NOW HAD OVER 100 MILLION PRIME CUSTOMERS  AND ITS FIRST QUARTER PROFIT  ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK  JUMPED MORE THAN 120 PERCENT  SENDING ITS STOCK PRICE SOARING NETFLIX  TOO  HAS BEEN RAISING PRICES  DOING SO MOST RECENTLY IN OCTOBER AS THE SEEMINGLY UNSTOPPABLE AMAZON JUGGERNAUT ROLLS ON  THERES NO DOUBT THAT MEDIA AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS MARKETS ARE CONVERGING AND UNDERGOING RADICAL TRANSFORMATION  AT T WANTS TO COMBINE ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS WITH TIME WARNERS CONTENT CREATION  A TRANSACTION KNOWN AS VERTICAL INTEGRATION BECAUSE THE TWO COMPANIES ARENT DIRECT COMPETITORS WHILE ANTITRUST CHALLENGES TO VERTICAL COMBINATIONS HAVE BEEN RARE  THE TRUMP JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SUED TO BLOCK THE AT T TIME WARNER MERGER ON GROUNDS THAT THE COMBINED COMPANIES MIGHT THREATEN TO WITHHOLD TIME WARNER CONTENT TO EXTRACT HIGHER PRICES FROM RIVAL DISTRIBUTORS  A CLAIM THE COMPANIES HAVE DISMISSED AS ECONOMIC NONSENSE BUT AMAZON IS ALREADY VERTICALLY INTEGRATED  IT CREATES CONTENT AND DISTRIBUTES IT OVER THE INTERNET  SO ARE NETFLIX  GOOGLE  WITH YOUTUBE  AND FACEBOOK  WITH ITS WATCH FEATURE AND OTHER OFFERINGS WHICH IS WHY THE SO CALLED FANG COMPANIES  FACEBOOK  APPLE  AMAZON  NETFLIX AND GOOGLE  LOOMED LARGE AT THE JUST COMPLETED AT T TIME WARNER TRIAL AND MAY WELL FIGURE IN A SPRINT T MOBILE DECISION  EVEN THOUGH NONE OF THE TECHNOLOGY GIANTS IS DIRECTLY INVOLVED OR IS A PARTY TO THE LITIGATION AT TS CHIEF EXECUTIVE  RANDALL STEPHENSON  REPEATEDLY REFERRED TO THE TECHNOLOGY GIANTS DURING THE TRIAL  AND MADE CLEAR THAT THEY ARE WHAT DROVE THE MERGER  THE MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IS GOING THROUGH SOME RATHER SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION  HE TESTIFIED  ITS COMING FROM PREDOMINATELY FOLKS IN THE TECH SECTOR THE TIME WARNER CHIEF EXECUTIVE  JEFF BEWKES  MADE THE SAME ARGUMENT  THEY HAVE THE CONTENT  THE PROGRAMMING  AND THEY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITY OF DELIVERING IT STRAIGHT TO YOU  HE SAID  ADDING THAT BY THEY HE MEANT THE FANGS  AND THEY CAN COMMUNICATE WITH YOU ABOUT THAT RELATIONSHIP AND WHAT TO WATCH AND HOW TO VALUE THE PROGRAM IN CLOSING ARGUMENTS THIS WEEK  AT T AND TIME WARNERS LEAD TRIAL LAWYER  DANIEL PETROCELLI  ARGUED THAT A COMBINED COMPANY COULD USE THE KIND OF DATA ABOUT ITS USERS THAT IS ROUTINELY COLLECTED BY THE TECH COMPANIES TO ENHANCE ITS PROGRAMMING AND OFFER MORE TARGETED ADVERTISING  IT COULD USE THE RESULTING HIGHER REVENUES TO REDUCE CONSUMER PRICES BY WHAT HE ESTIMATED TO BE  MILLION PER YEAR THE GOVERNMENTS LEAD LAWYER  CRAIG CONRATH  PROVIDED A COUNTERARGUMENT  THE FACT THAT AT T MAY WANT TO COMPETE IN SOME OTHER MARKET  THAT DOESNT GIVE THEM A FREE PASS TO REDUCE COMPETITION IN THE PAY TV MARKET  HE SAID   THE PAY TV MARKET HAS TRADITIONALLY INCLUDED SUBSCRIPTION TV PROVIDERS  INCLUDING CABLE AND SATELLITE  BUT NOT OVER THE INTERNET PROVIDERS LIKE AMAZON AND NETFLIX AT T SEES NETFLIX  YOUTUBE AND AMAZON AS THE WOLVES AT THE DOOR  SAID SCOTT HEMPHILL  AN ANTITRUST EXPERT AT THE NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW  THATS THE CENTER OF THEIR THEORY TIME WARNERS CONTENT COMPANIES  LIKE HBO  CNN AND THE TURNER CHANNELS  ARE JUST ISLANDS OF CONTENT UNMOORED FROM THE CONSUMER  HE SAID OF COURSE  THE ARGUMENT CAN BE MADE THAT AT T DOESNT NEED TO BUY A COMPANY LIKE TIME WARNER  IT COULD CREATE A MEDIA CONTENT COMPANY OF ITS OWN  THATS WHAT AMAZON AND NETFLIX DID  AND BOTH COMPANIES NOW OUTSPEND TIME WARNER ON ORIGINAL PROGRAMMING BUT FROM A CONSUMER STANDPOINT  IT DOESNT REALLY MATTER  THE MAJOR TECH PLATFORMS ARE BECOMING VERTICALLY INTEGRATED AS THEY CREATE THEIR OWN CONTENT TO PUSH OUT OVER THEIR DISTRIBUTION PLATFORMS  RICH GREENFIELD OF THE INVESTMENT FIRM BTIG WROTE IN A RECENT RESEARCH NOTE  IN TURN  IS IT O K  TO BE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED IF YOU BUILD YOUR WAY IN  BUT NOT TO BUY YOUR WAY INTO IT  WHAT IF INSTEAD OF AN ACQUISITION OF TIME WARNER  AT T JUST SPENT  BILLION A YEAR ON CONTENT CREATION  THE WAY NETFLIX IS  WOULD THAT BE LEGAL  BUT BUYING TIME WARNER IS NOT WHETHER THE FANG COMPANIES COMPETE IN THE SAME MARKETS WITH AT T AND TIME WARNER IS OF MORE THAN ACADEMIC INTEREST  IT COULD WELL INFLUENCE JUDGE RICHARD LEONS DECISION  WHICH HE SAID HE WOULD DELIVER NO LATER THAN JUNE 12 IF JUDGE LEON DOES TAKE SUCH AN EXPANDED VIEW OF THE MARKET  AT T AND TIME WARNER WOULD MOST LIKELY PREVAIL  EVEN IF HE DOES FIND SOME VIOLATIONS  HE COULD IMPOSE CONDITIONS ON THE MERGER RATHER THAN BLOCK IT ENTIRELY  MUCH AS COMCAST HAD TO ACCEPT CONDITIONS ON ITS PURCHASE OF NBC UNIVERSAL MAKING A CASE THAT THE PROPOSED SPRINT T MOBILE MERGER WOULD BENEFIT CONSUMERS IS FAR MORE DIFFICULT  THE DEAL HAS DRAWN NEAR UNANIMOUS OPPOSITION FROM ANTITRUST EXPERTS THE SPRINT T MOBILE TIE UP  IN CONTRAST TO AT T TIME WARNER  WOULD BE A HORIZONTAL MERGER  A COMBINATION OF DIRECT COMPETITORS  THAT WAY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS OPERATING IN THE MARKET  THOSE KINDS OF DEALS HAVE TRADITIONALLY RECEIVED MORE ANTITRUST SCRUTINY THE GOVERNMENT REJECTED THE SAME MERGER LESS THAN FOUR YEARS AGO  AND THE RESULT WAS ROBUST COMPETITION AND LOWER PRICES FOR WIRELESS SERVICES  EXACTLY WHAT ANTITRUST REGULATORS FERVENTLY HOPE FOR  BEFORE THAT  IN 2011  THE GOVERNMENT BLOCKED A PROPOSED MERGER OF AT T AND T MOBILE SO THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE MARKETS IN WHICH THEY COMPETE HAVE SO CHANGED SINCE THEN THAT A MERGER NOW WOULDNT HARM CONSUMERS THE TWO COMPANIES WILL NEED TO ARGUE THAT THE MARKET IS NO LONGER JUST THE FOUR WIRELESS PROVIDERS  BUT NOW INCLUDES THE TECHNOLOGY GIANTS AND BROADBAND AND CABLE COMPANIES LIKE COMCAST  A MERGED SPRINT AND T MOBILE WOULD COMMAND ONLY A SMALL SHARE OF SUCH A VASTLY EXPANDED MARKET  AND WOULDNT HAVE THE POWER TO RAISE PRICES THAT MAY ARGUABLY BE THE CASE FOR VIDEO  WHICH CAN NOW BE STREAMED OVER WIRELESS HANDSETS  BUT NOT FOR VOICE CALLS AND TEXTING  AT LEAST NOT YET  SPRINT AND T MOBILE ARE TALKING UP THE POTENTIAL FOR 5G TECHNOLOGY TO FURTHER BLUR THE LINES BETWEEN TRADITIONAL MARKETS  BUT WIDESPREAD USE OF 5G IS STILL YEARS IN THE FUTURE COURTS AND ANTITRUST REGULATORS DONT USUALLY CONSIDER MERGER DEFENSES THAT DEPEND ON THE EXISTENCE OF UNDEPLOYED TECHNOLOGY  SAID HERBERT HOVENKAMP  AN ANTITRUST PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW SCHOOL AND THE WHARTON SCHOOL  OUR CRYSTAL BALLS ARENT THAT GOOD  WE DONT HAVE THE POWER TO GAZE FIVE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD  ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO FAST CHANGING TECHNOLOGY WHILE PROFESSOR HOVENKAMP SAID HE UNDERSTOOD THE ARGUMENT AT T AND TIME WARNER WERE MAKING ABOUT AMAZON  THIS WHOLE GENERIC IDEA THAT COMPANIES NEED TO MERGE TO GO UP AGAINST AMAZON MAY PLAY TO A GENERAL AUDIENCE  BUT IF YOU TAKE IT TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSION  IT COULD BE USED TO VALIDATE NEARLY EVERY MERGER PERHAPS T MOBILE AND SPRINT COULD HOLD OFF A FEW YEARS  AND RETURN WITH EVIDENCE THAT THEYRE ACTUALLY COMPETING WITH THE BIG TECH COMPANIES RATHER THAN MERELY ANTICIPATING THAT COMPETITION THEN AGAIN  GIVEN THE VAGARIES OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATIONS ANTITRUST POLICIES  THEY MAY FEEL THERES NO REASON NOT TO ROLL THE DICE NOW  MR  HOVENKAMP SAID

BUSINESS TIES IF THE U S  PRESIDENT MAKES GOOD ON A THREAT TO WITHDRAW  SIX SOURCES TOLD REUTERS TRUMP  WHO SAYS THE 2015 ACCORD IS A  DISASTER  HAS ALL BUT DECIDED TO WITHDRAW BY MAY 12  U S  OFFICIALS SAY  AND LOOKS SET TO REJECT FOUR MONTHS OF EUROPEAN EFFORTS TO ADDRESS HIS CONCERNS  BUT FRANCE  BRITAIN AND GERMANY AIM TO PRESENT TO THE WHITE HOUSE A SEPARATE POLITICAL AGREEMENT THAT COMMITS TO TAKING A TOUGHER STANCE ON IRAN IF THEY CAN AGREE IT IN TIME WITH THE U S  STATE DEPARTMENT  THEIR AMERICAN INTERLOCUTORS  SEVERAL OF THE SOURCES SAID THEY WERE SKEPTICAL THE EFFORT WOULD SUCCEED  AND ALL SAID THE EUROPEANS WERE ALSO WORKING ON DAMAGE LIMITATION SCENARIOS IF IT FAILS WE HAVE A WEEK TO CONTINUE TALKING TO THE AMERICANS TO SEE IF WE CAN FIND AN AGREEMENT ON THE DEAL  SAID A SENIOR EUROPEAN DIPLOMAT   BUT I DON T THINK THERE IS ANY REASON TO BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC THE POLITICAL AGREEMENT  WHICH IS A CULMINATION OF TRANSATLANTIC DIPLOMACY  DOES NOT INCLUDE IRAN OR RUSSIA AND CHINA  THE OTHER PARTIES TO THE ACCORD  IT SEEKS TO SPELL OUT TO TRUMP THAT EUROPE WILL SEEK TO CONTAIN TEHRAN S BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAM  ITS INFLUENCE IN SYRIA AND YEMEN  THE TERMS BY WHICH INSPECTORS VISIT SUSPECT IRANIAN SITES  AND  SUNSET  CLAUSES UNDER WHICH SOME OF ITS TERMS EXPIRE WHILE THE EUROPEANS AND THE AMERICANS HAVE NARROWED THEIR DIFFERENCES  THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO AGREE ON HOW TO HANDLE A U S  DESIRE TO EXTEND SOME OF THE LIMITS ON IRAN S NUCLEAR PROGRAM  WITHOUT REOPENING THE JULY 2015 ACCORD WE RE TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT FORMULAS THAT RESPOND TO THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE AMERICANS  BUT AT THE SAME TIME DO NOT GO AGAINST THE DEAL  SAID A SECOND SENIOR EUROPEAN DIPLOMAT THERE IS A CHANCE OF GETTING AN AGREEMENT  BUT EVEN IF WE HAVE WE ONE  I M NOT CONVINCED THAT IT WILL BE ENOUGH TO STOP THE U S  WITHDRAWING  THE DIPLOMAT SAID IN THEIR PACKAGE FOR TRUMP  THE EUROPEANS ARE ALSO GRAPPLING WITH A U S  DESIRE TO MAKE EXPLICIT THAT IRAN MUST GIVE INTERNATIONAL INSPECTORS ACCESS TO MILITARY SITES  THE EUROPEANS SAY THIS IS ALREADY IMPLICIT IN THE ORIGINAL DEAL THERE S A U S  VIEW THAT THE INSPECTION PROVISIONS AREN T STRONG ENOUGH  WHICH IS NOT A VIEW THAT IS SHARED BY THE EUROPEANS  SAID A THIRD DIPLOMAT INVOLVED IN THE DISCUSSIONS BUYING TIME  CONTINGENCY MEASURESFRANCE S PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON AND GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL ARE CONTINUING TO LOBBY TRUMP  BUT WITH THE PROSPECT OF HIM CHANGING HIS MIND REMOTE  THE FOCUS HAS SHIFTED TO MANAGING THE FALLOUT AND AVOIDING A DANGEROUS VACUUM MACRON IN WASHINGTON LAST WEEK PROPOSED THAT  IRRESPECTIVE OF TRUMP S DECISION  THERE SHOULD BE A WIDER DISCUSSION BETWEEN IRAN AND THE POWERS BEHIND THE ORIGINAL DEAL  WHICH TOOK 12 YEARS TO NEGOTIATE  WORKING TOWARDS A GRAND BARGAIN THAT WOULD INCORPORATE THE EXISTING NUCLEAR DEAL AND THE ISSUES CURRENTLY DISCUSSED BETWEEN EUROPEANS AND AMERICANS  BUT IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW IRAN COULD BE BROUGHT BACK TO THE TABLE  TEHRAN SAYS IT IS ABIDING BY THE TERMS OF THE 2015 DEAL AND HAS NO INTENTION TO RENEGOTIATE IT IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER MOHAMMAD JAVAD ZARIF ON THURSDAY REJECTED ANY FORM OF RENEGOTIATION  FRANCE  BRITAIN AND GERMANY ALL SAY THEY WILL STAY IN THE DEAL EVEN IF THE UNITED STATES WITHDRAWS  AND TRY TO PROTECT AND FOSTER TRADE WITH IRAN THAT HAS SOARED SINCE THE EUROPEAN UNION LIFTED MOST OF ITS ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ON IRAN IRAN S EXPORTS OF MAINLY FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY PRODUCTS TO THE EU IN 2016 JUMPED 344 PERCENT TO 5 5 BILLION EUROS  58 BILLION  COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR  WHILE INVESTMENT IN IRAN JUMPED TO MORE THAN 20 BILLION EUROS IF TRUMP CAN T BE PERSUADED NOT TO WITHDRAW   THE SECOND BEST SOLUTION IS TO ENCOURAGE THE AMERICANS TO   KEEP CONDITIONS THAT ENABLE OUR COMPANIES IN NON OIL RELATED SECTORS TO CONTINUE TO TRADE  SAID A FRENCH OFFICIAL THE GERMAN ECONOMY MINISTRY SAID IT WAS WAITING FOR A FORMAL U S  DECISION ON THE IRAN DEAL BEFORE DECIDING WHETHER TO STOP OFFERING GERMAN FIRMS EXPORT GUARANTEES FOR BUSINESS DEALS WITH TEHRAN  SUCH GUARANTEES PROVIDE STATE PROTECTION FOR COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS ABROAD WHEN FOREIGN DEBTORS FAIL TO PAY THE PROSPECT OF TRADE WITH EUROPE WOULD PROVIDE THE EUROPEANS WITH A CHANCE TO ASSUAGE THE IRANIANS  AND DISSUADE THEM FROM RASH DECISIONS SUCH AS LEAVING THE DEAL OR REVIVING THE NUCLEAR ACTIVITIES THEY AGREED TO GIVE UP COUNTERMEASURES COULD INCLUDE A SPECIAL EU BLOCKING STATUTE DEVELOPED IN THE 1990S BUT NEVER FULLY USED  TO SHIELD EUROPEAN FIRMS DOING BUSINESS WITH IRAN FROM U S  LEGAL ACTION IF WASHINGTON REIMPOSES SANCTIONS BUT EU PLANS TO KEEP MONEY FLOWING TO IRAN WOULD REQUIRE THE UNITED STATES TO APPROVE NON DOLLAR DENOMINATED EXPORT CREDIT FACILITIES AND OTHER FUNDING SUPPORT TO HELP FIRMS ENTER IRAN WITHOUT FEAR OF AMERICAN LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS TWO EUROPEAN OFFICIALS SAID REVIVING THE BLOCKING STATUTES WOULD STILL BE MOSTLY A SYMBOLIC STEP TO SHOW THE IRANIANS THAT EUROPE WAS COMMITTED TO THE DEAL  IN PRACTICE  COMPANIES WOULD FEAR THAT INVESTING IN IRAN WOULD HARM THEIR COMMERCIAL INTERESTS WITH THE UNITED STATES A SENIOR IRANIAN OFFICIAL AGREED THESE ARE GOOD IDEAS TO SHOW THE EUROPEANS ARE COMMITTED TO THE AGREEMENT  BUT WE THINK THAT IF THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN IRAN AND THE UNITED STATES  THEY WILL CHOOSE THE AMERICA  SAID THE SENIOR IRANIAN OFFICIAL    0 8361 EUROS   REPORTING BY JOHN IRISH AND

20180506,business,business,9,BARNES   NOBLE IS IN TROUBLE  YOU HEAR THAT  IN WORRIED TONES  WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE IN THE BOOK BUSINESS  YOU FEEL IT WHEN YOU WALK INTO ONE OF THE CHAINS STORES  A CLUTTERED MIX OF GIFTS  GAMES  DVDS  DVDS  AND BOOKS  AND YOU REALLY SEE THE PROBLEMS IF YOU DIG INTO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REVENUE FROM NOOK  THE COMPANYS E BOOK DEVICE  HAS FALLEN MORE THAN 85 PERCENT SINCE 2012  ONLINE SALES OF PHYSICAL BOOKS HAVE ALSO PLUMMETED  AT THE STORES  WHERE BUSINESS WAS ONCE HOLDING UP  ITS DOWN ABOUT 10 PERCENT OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS  SEVERAL STORES  LIKE MY LOCAL ONE  IN THE WASHINGTON SUBURBS  HAVE CLOSED  AND MANY HAVE REDUCED STAFF THE COMPANYS LEADERS CLAIM THAT THEY HAVE A TURNAROUND PLAN  BASED ON SMALLER  MORE APPEALING STORES FOCUSED ON BOOKS  AND I HOPE THE PLAN WORKS  ITS DEPRESSING TO IMAGINE THAT MORE THAN 600 BARNES   NOBLE STORES MIGHT SIMPLY DISAPPEAR  AS ALREADY HAPPENED WITH BORDERS  IN 2011  BUT THE DEATH OF BARNES   NOBLE IS NOW PLAUSIBLE AT FIRST GLANCE  THIS SEEMS LIKE A CLASSIC STORY OF BUSINESS DISRUPTION  BARNES   NOBLE AND BORDERS WERE ONCE SO IMPOSING THAT THEY SERVED AS THE MODEL FOR THE EVIL CORPORATION TRYING TO CRUSH INDEPENDENT BOOKSTORES IN THE 1998 MOVIE YOUVE GOT MAIL  THEN THE WORLD CHANGED  THE OLD LEADERS COULDNT KEEP UP  SUCH IS CAPITALISM EXCEPT THATS NOT ANYWHERE NEAR THE FULL STORY RECEIVE THE DAYS MOST URGENT DEBATES RIGHT IN YOUR INBOX BY SUBSCRIBING TO THE OPINION TODAY NEWSLETTER THE FULL STORY REVOLVES AROUND GOVERNMENT POLICY  IN PARTICULAR  WASHINGTONS LENIENCY  UNDER BOTH PARTIES  TOWARD TECHNOLOGY GIANTS THAT HAVE COME TO RESEMBLE MONOPOLIES  THESE GIANTS ARE POPULAR  BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE GOOD PRODUCTS AND SERVICE  BUT THEY HAVE ALSO BECOME MIGHTY ENOUGH TO VANQUISH THEIR COMPETITORS AND CREATE PROBLEMS FOR SOCIETY FOR MOST OF AMERICAN HISTORY  THE GOVERNMENT VIEWED GIANT CORPORATIONS OF ANY KIND AS INHERENTLY PROBLEMATIC  THEIR SIZE GAVE THEM TOO MUCH POWER  TO ELIMINATE COMPETITION  RAISE PRICES  HOLD DOWN WAGES AND INFLUENCE POLITICS  SO THE GOVERNMENT PASSED LAWS TO RESTRAIN BUSINESSES AND OCCASIONALLY BROKE UP THE LARGEST  LIKE STANDARD OIL AND AT T IN THE 1970S  HOWEVER  A NEW IDEA TOOK HOLD  SIZE WAS NOT A PROBLEM SO LONG AS PRICES REMAINED LOW  BIGNESS COULD EVEN BE GOOD  BECAUSE IT PROMOTED EFFICIENCY AND THUS LOWER PRICES  THE LEGAL SCHOLAR ROBERT BORK WAS THE MOST INFLUENTIAL ADVOCATE FOR THIS VIEW  AND IT SOON GUIDED THE SUPREME COURT  THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION AND PRETTY MUCH EVERY ADMINISTRATION SINCE BUT THE THEORY HAS TWO HUGE FLAWS  AS A NEW GENERATION OF SCHOLARS  LIKE LINA KHAN  IS EMPHASIZING  ONE  PRICES ARE NOT A BROAD ENOUGH MEASURE OF WELL BEING  WAGES  INNOVATION AND POLITICAL POWER MATTER AS WELL  IF PRICES STAY LOW BUT WAGES DONT GROW  WHICH IS  ROUGHLY  WHATS HAPPENED IN RECENT DECADES  CONSUMERS ARENT BETTER OFF  TWO  REGULATORS HAVE FOCUSED ON SHORT TERM PRICES  SOMETIMES IGNORING WHAT CAN HAPPEN AFTER A COMPANY DRIVES OUT ITS RIVALS THE BOOK BUSINESS IS LOOKING LIKE A CASE STUDY  AMAZON IS TAKING OVER  YET HAS NEVER RUN INTO ANTITRUST SCRUTINY  IT HAS REDUCED PRICES  AFTER ALL  IT SELLS MANY E BOOKS FOR  99 AND HARDCOVER BEST SELLERS AT A BIG DISCOUNT  SO WHATS THE PROBLEM PLENTY  AMAZON HAS BEEN HAPPY TO LOSE MONEY ON BOOKS TO BUILD A LOYAL CUSTOMER BASE  TO WHICH IT CAN THEN SELL EVERYTHING ELSE  AMAZON ISNT PRIMARILY CONCERNED ABOUT BOOKS THESE DAYS  OREN TEICHER  WHO RUNS AN ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT BOOKSTORES  TOLD ME  THEY ARE FAR MORE FOCUSED ON GETTING CONSUMERS INTO THEIR ECOSYSTEM SO THEY CAN SELL THEM EVERY OTHER PRODUCT UNDER THE SUN BUT THE ARTIFICIALLY LOW PRICES HAVE CREATED A RAFT OF PROBLEMS  FEWER BOOKS ARE COMMERCIALLY VIABLE  PUBLISHERS ARE FOCUSING ON BIG NAME WRITERS  THE NUMBER OF PROFESSIONAL AUTHORS HAS DECLINED  THE DISAPPEARANCE OF BORDERS DEPRIVED DOZENS OF COMMUNITIES OF THEIR ONLY PHYSICAL BOOKSTORE AND LED TO A DROP IN BOOK SALES THAT LOOKS PERMANENT ALL THE WHILE  MANY WRITERS AND PUBLISHERS ARE AFRAID TO CRITICIZE AMAZON  THEYRE NOT BEING COMPLETELY PARANOID  EITHER  WHEN PUBLISHERS HAVE FOUGHT AMAZON  IT HAS SOMETIMES PUNISHED THEM BY DISRUPTING SALES  INTERNALLY  AMAZON EXECUTIVES HAVE DESCRIBED SMALL PUBLISHERS AS A GAZELLE  AND ITSELF AS A CHEETAH OH  AND NOW PRICES MAY BE RISING  LAST MONTH  AMAZON INCREASED THE ANNUAL COST OF ITS MEMBERSHIP PROGRAM  PRIME  BY 20 PERCENT  TO  LIKE MANY PEOPLE  I AM A FREQUENT AND USUALLY SATISFIED AMAZON CUSTOMER  BUT I AM ALSO STARTING TO WAKE UP TO THE DEEP PROBLEMS CREATED BY CORPORATE BEHEMOTHS  THEY HAVE THE POWER TO HOLD DOWN WAGES  AVOID TAXES  SQUASH COMPETITION AND PRODUCE A LESS VIGOROUS ECONOMY ONCE THE COUNTRY EMERGES FROM THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY  I HOPE WE WILL HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT TAKES MONOPOLIES SERIOUSLY  UNTIL THEN  ILL BE ROOTING FOR BARNES   NOBLE  SO  IT TURNS OUT  ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO ONCE VIEWED IT AS THE ENEMY  ITS IN THE INTEREST OF THE BOOK BUSINESS

UNDESIRABLY LOW THE FED ENDED ITS LATEST POLICY MEETING BY LEAVING ITS KEY SHORT TERM RATE UNCHANGED AT 1 5 PERCENT TO 1 75 PERCENT  THE LEVEL IT SET IN MARCH AFTER ITS SIXTH RATE INCREASE SINCE DECEMBER 2015  THE FED IS GRADUALLY TIGHTENING CREDIT TO CONTROL INFLATION AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF A TIGHT JOB MARKET  A RESILIENT ECONOMY AND A PICKUP IN CONSUMER PRICES IN A STATEMENT  THE CENTRAL BANK SAID IT EXPECTS  FURTHER GRADUAL INCREASES  IN RATES AND SAYS RECENT DATA SHOW IT S EDGING CLOSE TO ACHIEVING ITS ANNUAL 2 PERCENT TARGET FOR ANNUAL INFLATION INFLATION ON A 12 MONTH BASIS IS EXPECTED TO RUN NEAR THE COMMITTEE S SYMMETRIC 2 PERCENT OBJECTIVE OVER THE MEDIUM TERM  THE FED SAID THE USE OF  SYMMETRIC  SUGGESTS THAT FED OFFICIALS MIGHT BE WILLING TO LET INFLATION RUN SLIGHTLY ABOVE ITS 2 PERCENT TARGET FOR SOME TIME  GIVEN THAT INFLATION HAS RUN BELOW THE TARGET FOR SIX YEARS ANALYSTS SAID THE FED S STATEMENT WEDNESDAY MADE IT EVEN CLEARER THAT IT INTENDS TO RESUME RAISING

BEN AYERS  SENIOR ECONOMIST AT NATIONWIDE  SAID HE WAS INCREASING HIS FORECAST FROM THREE RATE INCREASES THIS YEAR TO FOUR IN THE BELIEF THAT THE FED WILL FOLLOW ITS HIKE IN MARCH WITH INCREASES IN

GREAT RECESSION ENDED JOB GAINS HAVE BEEN STRONG  ON AVERAGE  IN RECENT MONTHS AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS STAYED LOW  THE STATEMENT SAID IT DID OBSERVE THAT HOUSEHOLD SPENDING HAS SLOWED FROM A ROBUST PACE IN THE FINAL MONTHS OF 2017 AND HELD BACK GROWTH IN THE JANUARY MARCH QUARTER  BUT MOST ECONOMISTS EXPECT A SOLID REBOUND  WITH THE ECONOMY EXPANDING AT A 3 PERCENT ANNUAL RATE OR BETTER

ENDED DESPITE TRUMP S COMPLAINTS DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE THAT THE FED WAS AIDING DEMOCRATS IN KEEPING RATES ULTRA LOW UNDER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA  HIS CHOICES FOR A CHAIRMAN AND FOR OTHER BOARD POSITIONS HAVE BEEN MODERATES RATHER THAN HARD CORE CONSERVATIVES WHO WOULD FAVOR A FASTER TIGHTENING OF CREDIT UNDER POWELL S PREDECESSORS  YELLEN AND BEN BERNANKE  THE BOARD ENDURED CRITICISM FROM

OFF 400  OF THE STREET STYLE STAR ANNA DELLO RUSSO AT CHRISTIES  ALONG WITH THE SALE OF 150 ADDITIONAL PIECES ON NET A PORTER  AND THAT FOLLOWED THE 2008 SALE BY DAPHNE GUINNESS OF APPROXIMATELY 1 000 PIECES OF CHANEL  VERSACE  VALENTINO AND SAINT LAURENT  AMONG OTHER NAMES  AT KERRY TAYLOR AUCTIONS  AMID IT ALL WERE SMALLER SELL OFFS BY CHLO SEVIGNY ALONG WITH KHLO AND KOURTNEY KARDASHIAN  AND SISTERS KENDALL AND KYLIE JENNER  ALL OF WHOM HAD SPECIAL POP UP SHOPS ON THEREALREAL COM  WITH THE JENNER KARDASHIANS DIVESTING THEMSELVES OF OVER 500 GENTLY WORN ITEMS LAST YEAR THE AGE OF THE COLONIC CLEANSE IS GIVING WAY TO THE AGE OF THE CLOSET CLEANSE  YOU CAN FOCUS ON THE BIZARRE NUMBERS INVOLVED AND BEAT YOUR BREAST ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF A CULTURE IN WHICH ONE IS DRIVEN TO ASK  WHO NEEDS SO MANY CLOTHES  YET WHILE IT IS A LEGITIMATE QUESTION  A MORE RELEVANT ONE MAY BE  AFTER DECADES IN WHICH FAST FASHION GAVE RISE TO ACCESSIBLE LUXURY AND SPURRED AN ACCELERATED SEASONAL CYCLE THAT IN TURN SPURRED A BINGE OF ACCUMULATION  BE IT SHIRTDRESSES OR SNEAKERS  SUPREME OR HERMS  ARE WE FINALLY REACHING A TIPPING POINT  I HOPE SO  SAID MR  SILVER  WHO HAD A WARDROBE OF THOUSANDS OF PIECES SCATTERED BETWEEN HIS HOMES IN LOS ANGELES  NEW YORK AND PENNSYLVANIA  INCLUDING  HE SAID  50 MAN FURS IN STORAGE IN L A  AND I DONT EVEN WEAR FUR  ITS WHAT I SPENT MONEY ON INSTEAD OF BUYING A HOUSE IN MALIBU HE STILL LOVES CLOTHES  BUT HE HAS SOME NEW MANTRAS  AND HE REGARDS THEM WITH THE SAME PASSION HE ONCE REGARDED A HOT PINK JIL SANDER BY RAF SIMONS SUIT  SPECIFICALLY  ITS CHIC TO REPEAT AND THE BEST NEW CLOTHES ARE OLD CLOTHES OWNING DECADES WAS LIKE OPENING A WEIRD PANDORAS BOX FOR ME  MR  SILVER SAID  I WAS OBSESSED WITH CLOTHES GROWING UP  BUT IT WAS THE STORE THAT MADE ME A COLLECTOR  I LOOKED FOR PIECES THAT REPRESENTED A SEASON  OR TOLD THE STORY OF THE TIME WE WERE LIVING IN  BUT THEN IT TOOK OVER MY LIFE  IT WAS THE JOINT CHRONOLOGICAL LANDMARKS OF THE STORE TURNING 21 AND A LOOMING 50TH BIRTHDAY  MR  SILVER TURNS 49 LATER THIS MONTH  THAT SERVED AS MOTIVATION  HE SAID  TO LIBERATE MYSELF FROM ALL THESE POSSESSIONS  ITS TEMPTING TO BLAME IT ALL ON MARIE KONDO  AND HER BEST SELLING BOOK THE LIFE CHANGING MAGIC OF TIDYING UP  AND THERE IS SOMETHING SYMBOLIC AND CATHARTIC ABOUT SHEDDING WARDROBES  MANY OF THE SELLERS CITED PERSONAL  EMOTIONAL REASONS FOR DIVESTING THEMSELVES OF THEIR CLOTHES  MS  GUINNESS SOLD HERS IN PART AS A REACTION TO THE END OF HER MARRIAGE TO SPYROS NIARCHOS  MS  DELLA RUSSO DID SO AFTER THE DEATHS OF HER MENTORS MANUELA PAVESI AND FRANCA SOZZANI  AND THE BEGINNING OF A NEW RELATIONSHIP  AND MANY  THOUGH NOT ALL  ATTACHED THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALE  OR AT LEAST A PORTION  TO A CHARITY  ALMOST AS A FORM OF PENANCE FOR THE INDULGENCE BUT JUST AS THE CLOTHES THEMSELVES OFTEN REFLECT SPECIFIC MOMENTS IN TIME   MR  SILVER NOTED THAT HIS WARDROBE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HOW WE GOT TO THIS MENS WEAR FOCUSED MOMENT  WITH PIECES FROM DESIGNERS LIKE PACO RABANNE  STEPHEN SPROUSE  ISSEY MIYAKE  HAIDER ACKERMANN AND ALEXANDER MCQUEEN  THE SELL OFFS THEMSELVES MAY TELL US SOMETHING SPECIFIC ABOUT OUR PARTICULAR MOMENT THEY ARE NOT  FOR EXAMPLE  PART OF THE SAME CONTINUUM REALLY AS THE SALES BY CELEBRITIES LIKE LIZA MINNELLI AND JANE FONDA  WHICH HAVE ALSO BECOME SOMETHING OF A THING BUT WHICH RELATE MORE TO HOLLYWOOD MYTHOLOGY THAN FASHION  OR  SAY  THE RECENT RUSSELL CROWE DIVORCE AUCTION  WHICH WAS MOSTLY ABOUT THE VALUE OF HIS OWN CELEBRITY  AND BUYING A PIECE OF IT  INSTEAD  THE SALES BY MR  SILVER AND HIS ILK SEEM MORE PURELY RELATED TO THE CURRENT CONSUMER CULTURE  THEY ARE PRODUCTS OF THE WAY IN WHICH VISUAL CONSUMPTION AND THE NEED TO FILL THE DIGITAL VOID WITH MORE CRAZY OUTFITS  AND EVEN WILDER LOOKS  HAVE BEGUN TO DRIVE ACTUAL CONSUMPTION TO UNSUSTAINABLE LEVELS  NOT IN THE ECOLOGICAL SENSE  THOUGH THAT IS PART OF IT  BUT IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SENSE ITS A PECULIARLY CONTEMPORARY VICIOUS CYCLE  IF YOUR PERSONAL BRAND AND YOUR PROFESSIONAL BRAND ARE INCREASINGLY INTERCHANGEABLE  AND PART OF THAT BRAND IS DRESSING IN A SERIOUSLY EYE CATCHING WAY  AND THAT KIND OF DRESSING THEN CAUSES PHOTOGRAPHERS TO SEEK YOU OUT AND TAKE PICTURES  THAT IN TURN CREATES PRESSURE TO DRESS MORE CRAZILY AND CHANGE MORE OFTEN AND GET MORE STUFF  WHICH GETS MORE PICTURES AND SO ON AND SO ON AD INFINITUM THE EXPECTATION THAT WHENEVER I SHOWED UP  I WOULD WEAR SOMETHING THAT TURNED HEADS OR DROPPED JAWS WAS REALLY STRONG  MR  SILVER SAID  EVERY MET GALA HAD TO BE A BIGGER FASHION MOMENT  WHICH IN TURN ENCOURAGED ME TO BE EXTRA SOCIAL AND GO OUT LIKE CRAZY  IT WAS LIKE PERFORMANCE ART  BUT AT A CERTAIN POINT I FELT LIKE MY WARDROBE TOOK OVER MY AUTHENTICITY THIS PHENOMENON IS WHAT HAS LED ON A SMALLER LEVEL TO THE EXPLOSION OF THE RESALE MARKET  AND SITES LIKE VESTIAIRE COLLECTIVE  THE REALREAL AND  ON A MORE ACCESSIBLE LEVEL  THREDUP  WHERE FASHIONISTAS SELL THEIR SEASONAL SPLURGES TO MAKE ROOM IN THEIR CLOSETS AND HELP FINANCE THE NEXT ONES  ON A BIGGER LEVEL  IT HAS CREATED THE SELL OFF SITUATION ONCE UPON A TIME  GREAT FASHION PLATES  NAN KEMPNER  JACQUELINE DE RIBES  COLLECTED CLOTHES THE WAY THEY COLLECTED JEWELRY AND PORCELAIN AND THEN LEFT THEM TO A MUSEUM LIKE THE METS COSTUME INSTITUTE OR THE PALAIS GALLIERA IN PARIS  UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY WOULD BECOME CULTURAL RELICS  NOW THEY CAN DIVEST EARLIER  AND WITH PURPOSE VALERIE STEELE  THE DIRECTOR OF THE MUSEUM AT THE FASHION INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY  SAID IN AN EMAIL THAT AUCTIONS USED TO SELL ONLY 18TH  19TH  AND EARLY 20TH CENTURY PIECES  BUT NOW VINTAGE MEANS ANYTHING MORE THAN THREE SEASONS OLD  AND EVEN LESS SOMETIMES  MS  STEELE WROTE  THERE IS NO INCENTIVE FOR COLLECTORS WAITING UNTIL THEIR CLOTHES HAVE AGED INTO FASHION HISTORY  ESPECIALLY WHEN THE LATEST FASHIONS ARE ON DISPLAY IN MUSEUMS  AND ITS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT PEOPLE  AND HEIRS  INCREASINGLY SEEK TO MONETIZE FASHION COLLECTIONS BESIDES  MR  SILVER SAID  NOT EVERY MUSEUM WANTS EVERYTHING  INDEED  BEFORE HE DECIDED TO SELL OFF HIS CLOTHES  HE DONATED A NUMBER OF PIECES TO THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY MUSEUM OF ART FOR REIGNING MEN  A SHOW ON MENS WEAR THAT OPENED IN APRIL 2016  AND ITS NOT LIKE HE WONT HAVE ANYTHING LEFT  THERE ARE STILL 300 PAIRS OF SHOES  HE SAID  AND SUITS IN 50 SHADES OF GRAY FROM PRETTY MUCH EVERY DESIGNER YOU CAN NAME  SINCE GRAY SUITS HAVE BECOME HIS NEW UNIFORM  BUT  MR  SILVER SAID  IT FEELS GREAT TO BE FREE FROM THE PRESSURE TO FIGURE OUT WHOS THE HOTTEST NEW DESIGNER OR WHATS THE MOST IMPORTANT NEW SILHOUETTE  ITS A MONSTER OF OUR OWN CREATION  BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE A GROWING  AND WELCOME  CONSENSUS THAT ITS TIME TO CUT OFF ITS HEAD

REMINISCED ABOUT THE CRAZY SENATORS THEY HAD SERVED WITH  THE OVERSEAS TRIPS THEY TOOK TOGETHER FOR DECADES AND THE FRIENDSHIP MR  MCCAIN FORGED WITH MR  BIDENS TWO SONS BUT THE CONVERSATION ON THE SUN SPLASHED DECK OFF MR  MCCAINS BEDROOM WAS NOT ALL NOSTALGIA HERE JOHN KNOWS HES IN A VERY  VERY  VERY PRECARIOUS SITUATION  AND YET HES STILL CONCERNED ABOUT THE STATE OF THE COUNTRY  MR  BIDEN SAID IN AN INTERVIEW  WE TALKED ABOUT HOW OUR INTERNATIONAL REPUTATION IS BEING DAMAGED AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR PEOPLE TO STAND UP AND SPEAK OUT AS HE BATTLES BRAIN CANCER AND THE DEBILITATING SIDE EFFECTS OF HIS AGGRESSIVE TREATMENT  MR  MCCAIN HIMSELF IS RECKONING WITH HIS HISTORY AND THE FUTURE  AS HE AND A STREAM OF FRIENDS SHARE MEMORIES AND SAY WHAT NEEDS TO BE SAID NO ONE IS SAYING GOODBYE  NOT EXPLICITLY  THE SON AND GRANDSON OF ADMIRALS  MR  MCCAIN DOESNT LIKE OVERT SENTIMENTALITY  AS HIS FRIEND THE FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF GRANT WOODS PUT IT  BUT HIS VISITORS ARE TELLING HIM THEY LOVE HIM  HOW MUCH HE HAS MEANT TO THEM  AND TOGETHER THEY ARE TAKING CARE OF UNFINISHED BUSINESS THE REPUBLICAN SENATOR ENCOURAGED THE FORMER DEMOCRATIC VICE PRESIDENT TO NOT WALK AWAY FROM POLITICS  AS MR  BIDEN PUT IT BEFORE REFUSING TO DISCUSS A POSSIBLE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL RUN  MR  MCCAIN IS USING A NEW BOOK AND DOCUMENTARY TO REVEAL HIS REGRET ABOUT NOT SELECTING FORMER SENATOR JOSEPH I  LIEBERMAN AS HIS RUNNING MATE IN 2008  HIS INTIMATES HAVE INFORMED THE WHITE HOUSE THAT THEIR CURRENT PLAN FOR HIS FUNERAL IS FOR VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE TO ATTEND THE SERVICE TO BE HELD IN WASHINGTONS NATIONAL CATHEDRAL BUT NOT PRESIDENT TRUMP  WITH WHOM MR  MCCAIN HAS HAD A ROCKY RELATIONSHIP AND SOME OF HIS ASSOCIATES  THOUGH NOT HIS FAMILY  HAVE STARTED TO QUIETLY PUT OUT WORD THAT THEY WANT A MCCAIN PERSON EVENTUALLY APPOINTED TO FILL HIS SENATE SEAT  A ROSTER THAT INCLUDES HIS WIFE  CINDY MR  MCCAIN  81  IS STILL IN THE FIGHT  STRUGGLING WITH THE GRIM DIAGNOSIS HE RECEIVED LAST SUMMER  HE HAS BEEN LEADING CONFERENCE CALLS WITH HIS STAFF IN A STRAINED VOICE  GRINDING OUT THREE HOUR PHYSICAL THERAPY SESSIONS AND REWARDING HIMSELF MOST DAYS WITH A TALL GLASS OF ABSOLUT ELYX ON ICE BUT HIS HEALTH HAS BECOME A MATTER OF IMMEDIATE POLITICAL INTEREST  MR  MCCAINS FUTURE MAY DETERMINE WHETHER REPUBLICANS RETAIN THEIR SINGLE SEAT SENATE MAJORITY  SHOULD THE SENATOR DIE OR RESIGN BEFORE THE END OF MAY  THERE WILL MOST LIKELY BE A SPECIAL ELECTION FOR THE SEAT THIS FALL  BUT UNDER ARIZONA LAW  IF HE REMAINS IN OFFICE INTO JUNE  THERE WILL PROBABLY NOT BE AN ELECTION FOR THE SEAT UNTIL 2020  WHICH REPUBLICANS WOULD PREFER GIVEN DEMOCRATIC ENTHUSIASM THIS YEAR THE MATTER OF SUCCESSION FOR THE MCCAIN SEAT  A TOPIC OF SUCH INTENSE DISCUSSION THAT REPUBLICANS OFFICIALS HERE JOKE THAT WASHINGTON LAWYERS KNOW ARIZONA ELECTION LAW BETTER THAN ANY LAWYER IN THE STATE  IS OFFICIALLY VERBOTEN AMONG PARTY OFFICIALS AND THE SENATORS FRIENDS  THEY ARE DETERMINED TO REWARD HIM WITH THE SAME GOOD ENDING THAT HIS FRIEND SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY ENJOYED BEFORE HE SUCCUMBED TO BRAIN CANCER IN 2009 MR  MCCAIN  WHO IS NOT DOING INTERVIEWS  DELIGHTS IN SITTING OUT ON HIS DECK WHERE HE ONCE HANDLED SLABS OF RIBS ON THE GRILL  FRIENDS SAY  HE AND HIS WIFE LISTEN TO THE HUMMINGBIRDS AND THE BURBLING STREAM THAT RUNS THROUGH THEIR 15 ACRE RANCH  ENJOY

CLOSEST FRIENDS  LOOK  THIS IS A MAN WHOSE WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN ACTIVE HAVING SPENT OVER TWO YEARS IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT WHILE HE WAS IMPRISONED IN VIETNAM  MR  MCCAIN HAS NO USE FOR BEING ALONE  WHETHER IT IS IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT OR AT HIS RANCH  AND HIS DECK IS WHERE HE RECEIVES A CONSTANT FLOW OF FRIENDS  WITH VISITS THAT OFTEN END WITH MR  MCCAIN SAYING  I LOVE YOU  AND TAKES CALLS ON THE IPHONE HE JUST SWAPPED FOR HIS TATTERED FLIP PHONE   MR  MCCAIN FINALLY MADE THE SWITCH TO DOWNLOAD THE MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL APP TO BETTER FOLLOW HIS ARIZONA DIAMONDBACKS MR  BIDEN AND HIS

DIFFERENCES IN PARTY IT WAS THE TWO OF US LAMENTING THE LOSS OF THE POLITICS OF THE PAST  MR  FLAKE SAID IT WAS ALSO AT HIS HIDDEN VALLEY RANCH WHERE THE SENATOR PARTICIPATED IN A NEARLY TWO HOUR HBO DOCUMENTARY AND CO WROTE WHAT HE ACKNOWLEDGES WILL BE HIS LAST BOOK  THE RESTLESS WAVE  BOTH OF WHICH ARE SET TO BE RELEASED THIS MONTH THE FILM AND THE BOOK  A COPY OF WHICH THE NEW YORK TIMES OBTAINED INDEPENDENTLY OF MR  MCCAIN  AMOUNT TO THE SENATORS FINAL SAY ON HIS CAREER AND A CONCLUDING ARGUMENT FOR A BRAND OF PRO FREE TRADE AND PRO IMMIGRATION REPUBLICANISM THAT  ALONG WITH HIS CALLS FOR PRESERVING THE AMERICAN LED INTERNATIONAL ORDER  HAVE GROWN OUT OF FASHION UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE BOOK  MR  MCCAIN SCORNS MR  TRUMPS SEEMING ADMIRATION FOR AUTOCRATS AND DISDAIN FOR REFUGEES HE SEEMS UNINTERESTED IN THE MORAL CHARACTER OF WORLD LEADERS AND THEIR REGIMES  HE WRITES OF THE PRESIDENT  THE APPEARANCE OF TOUGHNESS OR A REALITY SHOW FACSIMILE OF TOUGHNESS SEEMS TO MATTER MORE THAN ANY OF OUR VALUES  FLATTERY SECURES HIS FRIENDSHIP  CRITICISM HIS ENMITY YET MANY IN MR  MCCAINS OWN PARTY BELIEVE THAT  BY SELECTING SARAH PALIN AS HIS RUNNING MATE IN 2008  HE BEARS AT LEAST A SMALL MEASURE OF BLAME FOR UNLEASHING THE FORCES OF GRIEVANCE POLITICS AND NATIVISM WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WHILE HE CONTINUES TO DEFEND MS  PALINS PERFORMANCE  MR  MCCAIN USES THE DOCUMENTARY AND THE BOOK TO UNBURDEN HIMSELF ABOUT NOT SELECTING MR  LIEBERMAN  A DEMOCRAT TURNED INDEPENDENT  AS HIS RUNNING MATE HE RECALLS THAT HIS ADVISERS WARNED HIM THAT PICKING A VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHO CAUCUSED WITH DEMOCRATS AND SUPPORTED ABORTION RIGHTS WOULD DIVIDE REPUBLICANS AND DOOM HIS CHANCES IT WAS SOUND ADVICE THAT I COULD REASON FOR MYSELF  HE WRITES  BUT MY GUT TOLD ME TO IGNORE IT AND I WISH I HAD EVEN MORE STRIKING IS HOW MR  MCCAIN EXPRESSES HIS SORROW IN THE DOCUMENTARY  HE CALLS THE DECISION NOT TO PICK MR  LIEBERMAN ANOTHER MISTAKE THAT I MADE IN HIS POLITICAL CAREER  A SELF INDICTMENT THAT INCLUDES HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE KEATING FIVE SAVINGS AND LOAN SCANDAL AND HIS RELUCTANCE TO SPEAK OUT DURING HIS 2000 PRESIDENTIAL BID ABOUT THE CONFEDERATE BATTLE FLAG FLYING ABOVE THE SOUTH CAROLINA CAPITOL MR  LIEBERMAN SAID HE DIDNT KNOW MR  MCCAIN FELT THAT REGRET UNTIL HE WATCHED THE FILM  IT TOUCHED ME GREATLY  HE SAID HERE IN HIS ADOPTED STATE  HE HAS BEEN IMMORTALIZED AS AN ICON  JOHN MCCAIN IS A GIANT IN ARIZONA  SAID GOV  DOUG DUCEY  A REPUBLICAN  EXPRESSING SENTIMENTS THAT WERE ECHOED BY THE TEACHERS PROTESTING AT THE STATE CAPITOL LAST WEEK ERIK GILLMAN  A MATH INSTRUCTOR  SAID MR  MCCAIN HAD BECOME THE NEW BARRY GOLDWATER  A FIGURE AS INEXTRICABLY IDENTIFIED WITH THE DESERT AS CACTUS ITS WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT THE STATE  THE GRAND CANYON AND JOHN MCCAIN  MR  GILLMAN SAID BUT MR  MCCAINS CONSERVATIVE DETRACTORS HAVE NOT FORGIVEN HIS MAVERICK TENDENCIES SIMPLY BECAUSE HE IS ILL WHEN MR  PENCE ADDRESSED A HARD RIGHT AUDIENCE GATHERED IN TEMPE LAST WEEK TO PROMOTE THE ADMINISTRATIONS TAX CUTS  HE SAID THAT PEOPLE ALL ACROSS AMERICA ARE PRAYING FOR SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN  AND ONE WOMAN YELLED OUT  TO RETIRE MR  MCCAIN HAS LONG BEEN BOTH A FLAWED POLITICIAN AND A LARGER FIGURE OF HISTORY  BY VIRTUE OF HIS REFUSAL TO BE RELEASED EARLY FROM VIETNAMESE CAPTIVITY  FORMER SENATOR ROBERT J  DOLE  FOR EXAMPLE  WORE MR  MCCAINS P O W  BRACELET WHILE HIS FUTURE COLLEAGUE WAS IN THE HANOI HILTON PRISON CAMP MR  DOLE  NOW 94  SAID HE PLANNED TO TELL MR  MCCAIN IN A COMING PHONE CALL  YOURE A TOUGH GUY AND YOU CAN OVERCOME THIS IN WASHINGTON  MR  MCCAINS ADMIRERS BELIEVE THE SENATE AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY LACK A NEEDED COUNTERBALANCE TO MR  TRUMP AND WORRY THAT HIS ABSENCE ONLY PRESAGES A LARGER DECLINE IN THE COUNTRYS POLITICS  WITH MR  KENNEDY GONE AND MR  MCCAIN AILING  REPRESENTATIVE JOHN LEWIS OF GEORGIA  THE CIVIL RIGHTS LEGEND  IS ONE OF THE FEW FIGURES LEFT IN WASHINGTON WHO EVOKE A BIGNESS AT A MOMENT IN HISTORY THAT CAN SEEM ALL TOO SMALL THE SENATE IS CHANGING JUST LIKE THE COUNTRY IS CHANGING  SAID SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM  THE SOUTH CAROLINA REPUBLICAN  WHO IS MR  MCCAINS CLOSEST FRIEND IN THE CHAMBER  BUT WASHINGTON NOW REFLECTS WHATS GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY  RATHER THAN LEADING IT ANOTHER MCCAIN PROTGE  SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR OF MINNESOTA  A DEMOCRAT  SAID SHE TREASURED HOW MR  MCCAIN TREATED HER WHEN THEY WENT ON THE CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION TRIPS HE LOVES AND FOREIGN LEADERS WOULD ATTEMPT TO RECOGNIZE THE MALE LAWMAKERS BEFORE HER THEYD ALWAYS LOOK TO LINDSEY NEXT  MS  KLOBUCHAR SAID OF THE HEADS OF STATE  REFERRING TO MR  GRAHAM  A FREQUENT TRAVEL COMPANION OF MR  MCCAIN  BUT HED ALWAYS SAY  SENATOR KLOBUCHAR IS THE DEMOCRATIC LEAD AND SHELL BE GOING NEXT MR  MCCAINS HAS BEEN A LIFETIME OF RESTLESSNESS  BEGINNING WITH THE CHILDHOOD RELOCATIONS OF HIS NAVY FAMILY AND EVOLVING INTO UNCEASING DEMANDS OF WHAT ELSE  AIMED AT HIS SENATE STAFF  BUT THE MAN WHOSE POLITICAL CAREER TOOK FLIGHT AFTER HE FENDED OFF CHARGES OF CARPETBAGGING  BY NOTING THE LONGEST HE HAD LIVED IN ONE PLACE WAS AS A PRISONER OF WAR  HAS FOUND A MEASURE OF CONTENTMENT ON HIS RANCH MR  BIDEN SAID HE WAS STRUCK BY HOW SOLICITOUS MR  MCCAIN WAS OF HIM  INQUIRING ABOUT HOW HE COPED WITH THE LOSS OF HIS SON BEAU TO BRAIN CANCER  YET THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT SAID HE WAS THE ONE WHO HOPED TO IMPART A MESSAGE I WANTED TO LET HIM KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE HIM AND HOW MUCH HE MATTERS TO ME AND HOW MUCH I ADMIRE HIS INTEGRITY AND HIS COURAGE  MR  BIDEN SAID THEN HE BECAME MORE

20180505,business,business,10,LAST MAY  A FAMILIAR ROUTINE TOOK PLACE ON THE STEPS OF THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART  KATY PERRY ASCENDED THE RED CARPET AT THE ANNUAL COSTUME INSTITUTE GALA LOOKING LIKE THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN IN HER RED JOHN GALLIANO DRESS AND VEIL  JENNIFER LOPEZ WAFTED BY IN SKY BLUE VALENTINO  FLANKED BY HER FAVORITE YANKEE OF ALL TIME AND THE FOUNDER OF THE DESIGN HOUSE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING HER GOWN  BY CONTRAST  THE ENTRANCE OF THE PRIVATE EQUITY GURU STEPHEN A  SCHWARZMAN AND HIS WIFE  CHRISTINE  WAS INCONSPICUOUS  HE WORE A SIMPLE BLACK TUXEDO  SHE HAD ON A SHIMMERING GRAY VERSACE GOWN NEVERTHELESS  JOURNALISTS CALLED OUT THEIR NAMES  CAMERAS CONTINUED TO FLASH  AND OBNOXIOUS QUESTIONS FOLLOWED ABOUT WHICH COST MORE  THE PARTY THE COUPLE WAS WALTZING INTO OR THE ONE THEYD RECENTLY HELD IN PALM BEACH  FLA  IN HONOR OF MR  SCHWARZMANS 70TH BIRTHDAY  I THINK THIS ONE  MR  SCHWARZMAN SAID  ALTHOUGH IT WAS HARD NOT TO WONDER IF THIS GUESS WAS A MEASURE OF REALITY OR WISHFUL THINKING  CERTAINLY  THE MET HAD NO LIVE CAMELS IN THE ENTRYWAY TO THE PARTY SPACE  NOR DID GWEN STEFANI SERENADE ANNA WINTOUR TO THE REPORTED TUNE OF  000  BUT ALL THATS NEITHER HERE NOR THERE  MR  SCHWARZMANS BIRTHDAY BASH WITH CAMELS AND MS  STEFANI MAY HAVE BEEN CHEAPER THAN LAST YEARS COSTUME INSTITUTE GALA  BUT IT IS THANKS TO HIS FORTUNE  3 BILLION  ACCORDING TO FORBES  THAT THERES ANOTHER COSTUME INSTITUTE GALA THIS YEAR  HE AND HIS WIFE HELPED UNDERWRITE THE EXHIBITION HEAVENLY BODIES  FASHION AND THE CATHOLIC IMAGINATION  HANDING OVER A CHECK THAT TWO SOURCES CLOSE TO THE MUSEUM SAID WAS IN THE BALLPARK OF  MILLION  MUCH OF THE CULTURAL VITALITY OF NEW YORK HAS LONG BEEN DUE TO THE BENEVOLENCE OF SUCH GREAT AMERICANS AS BROOKE ASTOR AND DAVID ROCKEFELLER  MS  WINTOUR SAID IN A STATEMENT LAST WEEK  AT THE MET  WEVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY LUCKY TO PARTNER WITH STEPHEN AND CHRISTINE SCHWARZMAN  WHO  LIKE THE PHILANTHROPISTS WHOVE GONE BEFORE THEM  HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED EVERYTHING FROM ARTS AND CULTURE TO EDUCATION TO CATHOLIC CHARITIES  ITS THEIR GENEROSITY  ALONG WITH THAT OF MY FRIEND DONATELLA VERSACE  THAT HAS MADE THIS BRILLIANT AND GROUNDBREAKING EXHIBITION POSSIBLE  WHEN YOU WORK WITH THE LIKES OF STEPHEN AND CHRISTINE  EVERYONE BENEFITS SO MR  SCHWARZMAN MAY BE A FLASH POINT FOR INCOME INEQUALITY  A MAN WITH MORE MONEY THAN RESPECT  BUT THAT SELDOM STOPS HIM FROM HAVING THE LAST LAUGH  OR GETTING THE MULTI MILLION DOLLAR TAX WRITE OFF   ALL THE PEOPLE INVOLVED DECLINED INTERVIEWS  KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSETHERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS MR  SCHWARZMAN INSPIRES ENMITY  FIRST  NEW YORK CITY HAS MORE RESIDENTS WORTH AT LEAST  MILLION THAN ANY METROPOLIS ON PLANET EARTH  BUT IT STILL REGARDS ITSELF AS A PROGRESSIVE ENCLAVE  AN ADVISER TO PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO ONCE COMPARED OBAMA ERA TAX HIKES ON CORPORATIONS TO HITLER INVADING POLAND IS BOUND TO HAVE SOME ENEMIES   MR  SCHWARZMAN APOLOGIZED  BUT STILL  SECOND  MR  SCHWARZMAN IS FAMOUSLY BRASH  A 5 FOOT 6 INCH BUNDLE OF TESTOSTERONE WHO IN 2008 DESCRIBED HIS BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY BY SAYING  I WANT WAR  NOT A SERIES OF SKIRMISHES  THIS HAS EXTENDED NOT ONLY TO HIS RIVALS AT COMPETING FIRMS  BUT ALSO AT TIMES TO THOSE CLOSEST TO HIM  HIS MENTOR AT LEHMAN BROTHERS  WHERE MR  SCHWARZMAN WORKED IN THE EARLIER PART OF HIS CAREER  WAS PETER G  PETERSON  A MUCH REVERED SOCIETY AND BUSINESS WORLD FIGURE  AFTER MR  PETERSON LOST CONTROL OF LEHMAN IN 1984 AND LEFT THE COMPANY  MR  SCHWARZMAN WAS BEHIND THE PUTSCH THAT DROVE THEIR ENEMIES FROM POWER  TOGETHER  MR  PETERSON AND MR  SCHWARZMAN STARTED THE BLACKSTONE GROUP  A PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM THAT GREW INTO A FINANCIAL COLOSSUS THAT DWARFED COMPETITORS LIKE KOHLBERG KRAVIS ROBERTS AND THE CARLYLE GROUP  IN 2007  THE BLACKSTONE GROUP WENT PUBLIC  AND MR  SCHWARZMAN EARNED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THROUGH THE I P O  BUT THE SUBSEQUENT NEGOTIATIONS AROUND THE RETIREMENT PACKAGE OF HIS MENTOR MR  PETERSON  THEN 81  WERE BRUTAL  PEOPLE WHO KNEW THEM BOTH WERE SHOCKED   MR  PETERSON DIED IN MARCH  AT THE MEMORIAL  NUMEROUS ATTENDEES TOOK NOTE THAT MR  PETERSONS MOST FAMOUS PROTG WAS NOT SELECTED AS A SPEAKER THE BIG DONATIONSMR  SCHWARZMANS CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS HAVE IGNITED CONTROVERSY   THIS IS PARTLY BECAUSE THE GIFTS OFTEN COME WITH CONDITIONS  IN 2015  YALE UNIVERSITY ANNOUNCED THAT MR  SCHWARZMAN WAS DONATING  MILLION TO THE SCHOOL FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A STUDENT HUB LOCATED SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS CAMPUS  IT IS SCHEDULED TO OPEN IN 2020 AND WILL BE CALLED THE SCHWARZMAN CENTER IM MORE THAN COMFORTABLE WITH THAT  SAID PETER SALOVEY  THE SCHOOLS PRESIDENT  IT DEMONSTRATES OUR THANKFULNESS TO STEVE   SO WHOSE IDEA WAS IT TO NAME THE BUILDING IN THE DONORS HONOR  I CANT ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CONTRACTUAL NEGOTIATION  MR  SALOVEY SAID IN A PHONE INTERVIEW THAT WAS SUPERVISED BY A PUBLIC RELATIONS PERSON FROM MR  SCHWARZMANS TEAM  ITS A MATTER OF CONFIDENTIALITY ANYWAY  MR  SALOVEY POINTED OUT  THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF SPACES ON OUR CAMPUS NAMED FOR DONORS  AS WELL AS NUMEROUS OTHER PROMINENT NONPROFITS  THE FIFTH AVENUE HEADQUARTERS OF THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY IS NOW THE STEPHEN A  SCHWARZMAN BUILDING  THANKS TO A CONTRIBUTION OF  MILLION IN 2008  AND THE EDUCATION CENTER AT THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF ISRAELS NEW LANDMARK BUILDING IN JERUSALEM IS BEING NAMED FOR MR  SCHWARZMAN  AFTER A CONTRIBUTION EARLIER THIS YEAR FOR  MILLION ANNETTE DE LA RENTA  A BOARD MEMBER AT THE MET AND THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY  DOESNT GET WHY ALL THIS INSPIRES SUCH FUSS  SUCH SANCTIMONY  PEOPLE SHOULD JUST BE GRATEFUL  SHE SAID  YET THEYRE NOT ALWAYS  PARTLY THIS IS BECAUSE THERE REMAINS A SELECT GROUP OF PEOPLE  AMONG THEM  MRS  DE LA RENTA  WHO REMEMBER THAT BROOKE ASTOR RESCUED THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY FROM FINANCIAL RUIN IN THE EARLY 80S WITHOUT MAKING SUCH DEMANDS  ADDITIONALLY  THE RECENT FOCUS ON CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AT NEW YORKS MOST STORIED NONPROFITS IS OCCURRING AT A TIME WHEN THEIR BOARDS ARE CHOCK FULL OF REAL ESTATE BARONS AND FINANCE WIZARDS WHO HAVE VOTED TO REDUCE SERVICES  LAY OFF EMPLOYEES AND OFFLOAD ASSETS  IN 2014  THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART CUT THE RIBBON ON A FOUR BLOCK LONG PLAZA NAMED AFTER MR  SCHWARZMANS DOWNSTAIRS NEIGHBOR DAVID KOCH  WHO PAID  MILLION FOR THE PRIVILEGE  SHORTLY AFTERWARD  THE METS LEADERSHIP ANNOUNCED THAT THE MUSEUM WAS ELIMINATING THE JOBS OF UP TO 100 PEOPLE IN ADMINISTRATIVE  CONSERVATIONIST AND CURATORIAL POSITIONS IN AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS A BALLOONING  MILLION DEFICIT  ALL THAT MONEY FOR A BUNCH OF USELESS FOUNTAINS  SAID MICHAEL M  THOMAS  THE BEST SELLING AUTHOR WHO PRECEDED MR  SCHWARZMAN BOTH AS A STUDENT AT YALE AND AS A PARTNER AT LEHMAN BROTHERS  ACCORDING TO MR  THOMAS  MR  SALOVEY IS RIGHT TO ARGUE THAT MR  SCHWARZMAN IS ONE OF MANY PEOPLE AT YALE WITH A SPACE NAMED IN HIS HONOR  BUT THAT REVEALS THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM WITH MODERN PHILANTHROPY  NOT ITS ABSENCE  HE SAID  THATS WHY IM NOT GOING TO MY 60TH REUNION  HE SAID  YALE IS WHORESVILLE  U S A  YOU CAN QUOTE ME ON THAT EARLIER THIS YEAR  MR  SCHWARZMAN GAVE  MILLION TO THE HIGH SCHOOL HE HAD ATTENDED IN ABINGTON  PA  BUT PLANS TO RENAME IT AFTER HIM WERE SCRAPPED WHEN PEOPLE IN THE TOWN NEARLY HAD A CONNIPTION  TO THE DELIGHT OF MR  THOMAS  THE DONATION STILL WENT THROUGH  IT TOOK A LITTLE HIGH SCHOOL IN PENNSYLVANIA TO DO WHAT YALE WOULD NOT  HE SAID  CHUCKLING  A GREAT MARRIAGE JIMMY LEE  A FRIEND OF MR  SCHWARZMANS  HAS JOKED THAT MR  SCHWARZMAN HAS GIVEN MORE MONEY TO THE ARCHDIOCESE THAN ANY JEW IN NEW YORK  PARTLY  THIS IS BECAUSE HIS WIFE  CHRISTINE  IS CATHOLIC MR  SCHWARZMAN MET HER SOMETIME AROUND 1994  I FIXED THEM UP  SAID DEBBIE BANCROFT  A PARTY SCENE FIXTURE AND A CONTRIBUTOR TO AVENUE MAGAZINE  HE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN MARRIED TO ELLEN PHILIPS  THE DAUGHTER OF A WEALTHY OHIO INDUSTRIALIST  WHOM HE MET DURING HIS GRADUATE WORK AT HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL  CHRISTINE  A CORPORATE LAWYER  HAD RECENTLY SEPARATED FROM AUSTIN HEARST  THE GRANDSON OF THE MEDIA BARON WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST  MR  SCHWARZMANS COURTSHIP DID NOT TAKE LONG  IN NOVEMBER 1995  THE COUPLE MARRIED IN MANHATTAN AND GAVE A PARTY TO CELEBRATE AT THE FRICK MUSEUM  WHERE MR  SCHWARZMAN IS A LONGTIME BOARD MEMBER  FIVE YEARS LATER  MR  AND MRS  SCHWARZMAN MADE THEIR FIRST REAL MARK AS A SOCIETY COUPLE BY BUYING A 17 000 SQUARE FOOT  THREE FLOOR PENTHOUSE APARTMENT AT 740 PARK AVENUE  THAT WAS ITS OWN KIND OF A LEVERAGED BUYOUT  THE APARTMENT ONCE BELONGED TO JOHN D  ROCKEFELLER  LATER IT WAS OWNED BY SAUL STEINBERG  WHO SOLD IT TO MR  SCHWARZMAN AFTER MR  STEINBERGS COMPANY  THE RELIANCE GROUP  WENT INTO BANKRUPTCY  OFF WENT MR  STEINBERGS BILLIARD TABLES  DOWN CAME THE RED VINYL WALLS  WHICH REALLY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE WAY TO SHOWCASE MR  SCHWARZMANS MONETS AND CY TWOMBLYS  SOON  MR  AND MRS  SCHWARZMAN BEGAN DINING TTE TTE WITH CARDINAL EDWARD EGAN  THE LATE ARCHBISHOP OF NEW YORK  MR  SCHWARZMAN HAPPILY GAVE FINANCIAL ADVICE FOR CARDINAL EGAN TO TAKE BACK TO THE ARCHDIOCESE  MR  AND MRS  SCHWARZMAN ALSO BECAME FIXTURES ON THE CHARITY CIRCUIT   THEYRE PEAS IN A POD  SAID MS  BANCROFT  WHO OFTEN GETS A VALENTINES DAY CARD FROM MR  SCHWARZMAN THANKING HER FOR THE INTRODUCTION THAT HAS MADE HIM THE HAPPIEST MAN IN THE WORLD  THEYRE ENERGIZER BUNNIES  THEY LOVE DANCING  AND THEY LOVE WATCHING PEOPLE IN 2007  MR  SCHWARZMAN HELD HIS BIRTHDAY PARTY AT THE PARK AVENUE ARMORY  KNICKERBOCKERS GUIDED GUESTS TO THEIR TABLES  WHICH WERE IN A SPACE DESIGNED TO REPLICATE THE COUPLES LIVING ROOM  MARTIN SHORT SERVED AS THE M C  AND MADE JOKES ABOUT GUESTS LIKE MR  TRUMP  ROD STEWART AND PATTI LABELLE PERFORMED   MERE MONTHS AFTER MR  SCHWARZMAN SPENT  MILLION TO HAVE HIS NAME PLUNKED ACROSS THE FACADE OF THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY  MR  KOCH PAID  MILLION TO HAVE HIS NAME PUT ON THE FACADE OF LINCOLN CENTER  RESIDENTS AT 740 PARK AVENUE BEGAN TO FLOAT THE THEORY THAT THE CONSERVATIVE BILLIONAIRE ON THE FOURTH FLOOR WAS TRYING TO ONE UP THE CONSERVATIVE BILLIONAIRE ON 15  THE MET GALAHOW DOES A MAN PEOPLE ARE INCLINED TO MAKE FUN OF USUALLY WIND UP WITH THE UPPER HAND  WELL  HAVING MONEY HELPS A LOT  JUST LOOK AT MR  SCHWARZMANS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT MR  SCHWARZMAN DIDNT ENDORSE MR  TRUMP DURING THE CAMPAIGN  INSTEAD  HE DONATED TO JEB BUSH   HE EVEN ONCE COMPARED MR  TRUMP TO P T  BARNUM  WHEN SPEAKING TO CNN IN 2015  BUT THE BLACKSTONE GROUP IS AN ENORMOUSLY POWERFUL REAL ESTATE INVESTOR  BETWEEN 2013 AND 2017  IT PROVIDED MORE THAN  MILLION TO THE TROUBLED REAL ESTATE PROJECTS OF MR  TRUMPS SON IN LAW  JARED KUSHNER  MR  TRUMP WAS UNUSUALLY SOLICITOUS ABOUT MR  SCHWARZMAN DURING THE CAMPAIGN  AND REPORTEDLY ASKED AIDES NUMEROUS TIMES IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY LUCK GETTING HIM TO PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE  THAT DID NOT HAPPEN UNTIL AFTER MR  TRUMP WON THE ELECTION  AT WHICH POINT MR  SCHWARZMAN AGREED TO COME ABOARD HIS TEAM OF BUSINESS ADVISERS AND BEGAN RAISING MONEY FOR HIS RE ELECTION  WHEN MR  SCHWARZMAN CELEBRATED HIS 70TH BIRTHDAY IN FLORIDA IN FEBRUARY 2017  MR  KUSHNER AND HIS WIFE  IVANKA TRUMP  WERE AMONG THE GUESTS  AS WAS DONATELLA VERSACE IN 2014  THE BLACKSTONE GROUP BOUGHT A MINORITY STAKE IN HER COMPANY FOR  MILLION  SO WHEN VERSACE WAS APPROACHED TO SPONSOR THE COSTUME INSTITUTE GALA  BUT DIDNT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY  CALLING MR  SCHWARZMAN MADE SENSE  IN SEPTEMBER 2017  CARDINAL EGANS SUCCESSOR AT THE ARCHDIOCESE  CARDINAL TIMOTHY DOLAN  RECEIVED A VISIT FROM A COUPLE OF PEOPLE REPRESENTING THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART  CARDINAL DOLAN STILL CANT ENTIRELY REMEMBER WHO THEY WERE THERE WAS A GUY NAMED ANDREW AND THIS LADY WHO EDITS A MAGAZINE  CARDINAL DOLAN SAID IN AN INTERVIEW STILL  IT WAS CLEAR TO HIM SHE IS A PRETTY BIG DEAL  AN ADMIRED PERSON  HE SAID  BECAUSE ALL THESE PEOPLE IN HIS OFFICE GOT BIZARRELY STAR STRUCK WHEN SHE WALKED IN AS CARDINAL DOLANS VISITORS EXPLAINED IT TO HIM  THE THEME FOR THE COSTUME INSTITUTES BIG EXHIBITION FOR 2018 WAS TO BE HEAVENLY BODIES  A TRIBUTE TO THE CATHOLIC IMAGINATION NOT ALL THE PUBLICITY THE CHURCH RECEIVES IS POSITIVE  SO IT CAME AS A RELIEF TO HEAR THAT THE EXHIBIT WAS BEING UNDERWRITTEN BY HIS OLD FRIEND MR  SCHWARZMAN THATS WHEN I SAID  BINGO  CARDINAL DOLAN RECALLED OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS  FRIENDS OF THE SCHWARZMANS HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY SURPRISED THAT HIS CHECK UNDERWRITING THE EXHIBITION DIDNT TRANSLATE INTO INVITATIONS FOR THEM  IM STILL HOLDING OUT FOR THE POSSIBILITY THEY MAY GET A CANCELLATION FROM J LO  MS  BANCROFT JOKED PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE MUSEUM AND TO MS  WINTOUR HAVE BEEN A LITTLE SURPRISED THAT REQUESTS MADE OF THE SCHWARZMANS OCCASIONALLY GET TURNED DOWN  ULTIMATELY  THOUGH  ITS A WIN WIN  THE COSTUME INSTITUTE HAS THE MONEY IT NEEDED FOR THE EXHIBITION MR  AND MRS  SCHWARZMAN ARE THE SECOND COUPLE UNDERWRITING THE EXHIBIT AND CO HOSTING THE GALA SINCE 1997  WHEN NONE OTHER THAN MR  KOCH AND HIS WIFE  JULIA  HAD THEIR NAMES ON THE INVITATION  MR  AND MRS  SCHWARZMANS FRIENDS AT THE ARCHDIOCESE ARE HAPPY  MS  VERSACES CLOTHES ARE PROMINENTLY FEATURED IN THE GALLERIES  THE INVESTMENT COST LESS THAN 1 PERCENT OF HIS 2017

CAN SEE THAT THOSE ARE MORE IN LINE WITH THE NEED OF THE AREAS  SO THAT BEGS THE QUESTION  WHY IS THE PROPORTION SO DIFFERENT IN PUERTO RICO WHEN IT CAME TO FUNDS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION  SAID ENRIQUE FERNNDEZ TOLEDO  DIRECTOR OF THE PUERTO RICO RELIEF AND ECONOMIC POLICY INITIATIVE AT THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS IN NOVEMBER  THE HISPANIC ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES   UNIVERSITIES SUBMITTED A REQUEST TO MS  DEVOS ON BEHALF OF 65 OF PUERTO RICOS PRIVATE AND PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES TO AT LEAST DOUBLE THE ISLANDS TOTAL ALLOCATION OF WORK STUDY GRANTS TO HELP STUDENTS WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH COLLEGE  ONLY 5 PERCENT OF STUDENTS ON THE ISLAND WHO QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL NEED BASED AID RECEIVED FEDERAL WORK STUDY FUNDING  BUT MORE THAN 80 PERCENT OF STUDENTS WORK PART TIME JOBS TO HELP PAY THEIR WAY AFTER THE HURRICANE  THOSE JOBS VANISHED  THE PROPOSED FUND WOULD HAVE HELPED MAKE UP LOST WAGES FOR ALL STUDENTS WITH NEW TUTORING JOBS AND HURRICANE RELIEF WORK THE REQUEST WAS NOT GRANTED LAST FALL  CONGRESS GRANTED MS  DEVOS THE AUTHORITY TO REROUTE FEDERAL FUNDS FOR DISASTER RELIEF THROUGH THE HURRICANES HARVEY  IRMA AND MARIA EDUCATION RELIEF ACT OF 2017 IN JANUARY  SHORTLY AFTER MS  DEVOS ANNOUNCED THE DEPARTMENT HAD GRANTED ITS FIRST ROUND OF FUNDING  FLORIDAS SENATORS  MARCO RUBIO  A REPUBLICAN  AND BILL NELSON  A DEMOCRAT  URGED THE SECRETARY TO MAKE PUBLIC THE LIST OF SCHOOLS THAT RECEIVED ASSISTANCE AND THE METHODOLOGY USED TO DETERMINE THE FUNDING IN MARCH  THE DEPARTMENT RELEASED THE DATA  FIVE PUERTO RICO INSTITUTIONS DID TOP THE LIST OF THOSE THAT RECEIVED THE LARGEST

AREAS IN THE PATH OF THE HURRICANE THEY WERE N Y U  SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA  SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE UNIVERSITY  GRAND CANYON UNIVERSITY AND LIBERTY UNIVERSITY AND WHILE THE DEPARTMENT STRONGLY URGED INSTITUTIONS TO AWARD THE MONEY TO STUDENTS AFFECTED BY THE HURRICANE  IT DID NOT REQUIRE THEM TO DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS SAID THE DISBURSEMENTS WERE BASED ON A STATUTORY FORMULA  AUTHORIZED BY CONGRESS IF MEMBERS ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE ALLOCATION  THEN THEY SHOULD CHANGE THE LANGUAGE IN THE STATUTE AND WED BE HAPPY TO OBLIGE  SAID LIZ HILL  A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE DEPARTMENT INSTITUTIONS WERE DEEMED ELIGIBLE IF THEY PARTICIPATED IN THE TWO FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS FROM WHICH THE MONEY WAS DISPENSED  OR THEY ACCEPTED MORE THAN 20 STUDENTS FROM AFFECTED AREAS N Y U  WHICH RECEIVED  850  LED A PUBLIC CAMPAIGN TO TAKE IN STUDENTS FROM PUERTO RICO AND ENROLLED ABOUT 70 STUDENTS  THEY WERE REQUIRED TO PAY TUITION TO THEIR HOME UNIVERSITIES IN PUERTO RICO  AND HAD VIRTUALLY ALL COSTS COVERED BY N Y U  WHILE ATTENDING THE SCHOOL  THE STUDENTS ARE EXPECTED TO LEAVE WHEN THE SEMESTER ENDS WE ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO CONCERNS THAT THE UNIVERSITIES IN PUERTO RICO HAVE ABOUT SKIMMING STUDENTS WHO WERE IMPORTANT TO THEIR OWN ACADEMIC MISSION  SAID JOHN BECKMAN  A SPOKESMAN FOR THE UNIVERSITY GRAND CANYON UNIVERSITY  WHICH RECEIVED ABOUT  000  WOULD NOT SAY HOW MANY AFFECTED STUDENTS WERE ENROLLED  A LIBERTY UNIVERSITY OFFICIAL SAID THE SCHOOL DID NOT COUNT OUT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO BENEFITED FROM ITS  000 AWARD  BUT OFFICIALS SAID THE UNIVERSITY FINANCIALLY SUPPORTED STUDENTS  MAINLY FROM FLORIDA  IN A NUMBER OF WAYS AFTER THE HURRICANE SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE SAID IT HAD MORE THAN 11 000 STUDENTS FROM THE AFFECTED STATES  ABOUT 50 OF WHOM WERE FROM PUERTO RICO  AND PLANNED TO RETURN ANY UNUSED FUNDS TO THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA DISBURSED ITS FIRST FEDERAL AID ALLOCATION OF  453 TO 38 STUDENTS  SAID RICK WILDER  THE DIRECTOR OF STUDENT FINANCIAL AFFAIRS  THE REMAINDER WILL BE RESERVED FOR RETURNING STUDENTS WHO DEMONSTRATE NEED NEXT YEAR WERE ALWAYS EXCITED TO GET ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR ANY NEEDY STUDENTS  MR  WILDER SAID IN THE COMING MONTHS  THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT WILL AWARD  MILLION IN ADDITIONAL EMERGENCY FUNDING TO COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND THEIR STUDENTS IN AREAS DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY HURRICANES AND WILDFIRES  AND  MILLION TO HELP DEFRAY COSTS FOR THOSE THAT TOOK IN STUDENTS FROM THE AFFECTED AREAS BUT CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS WROTE LAST MONTH THAT THE VOLUMINOUS APPLICATION  WHICH REQUIRES TWO APPLICATIONS AND A DETAILED ACCOUNTING OF EXPENSES AND FUNDING RECEIVED THUS FAR  WOULD PLACE ON PUERTO RICO A SIGNIFICANT AND UNNECESSARY BURDEN THAT WAS NEVER INTENDED BY CONGRESS SEVERAL PARTIES PROTESTED THE DEPARTMENTS APPLICATION PROCESS  INCLUDING THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS AND FELIX V  MATOS RODRIGUEZ  THE PRESIDENT OF QUEENS COLLEGE IN NEW YORK LAWMAKERS NOTED THAT THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR THIS ROUND OF FUNDING WAS MARKEDLY DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER DISASTER RELIEF DISBURSEMENTS OF SIMILAR SCALE  IN 2005  AFTER HURRICANES KATRINA AND RITA DEVASTATED THE GULF COAST  INSTITUTIONS IN LOUISIANA AND MISSISSIPPI WERE ABLE TO GAIN ACCESS TO  MILLION IN CONGRESSIONALLY APPROPRIATED FUNDS WITHOUT AN APPLICATION AND THEY NOTED OF THE MOST RECENT DISBURSEMENTS  IT IS UNCLEAR WHY INSTITUTIONS LOCATED IN THE DISASTER AREAS AND EXPERIENCED GREATER HARM ARE BEING SUBJECTED TO DISPROPORTIONATE HURDLES RELATIVE TO INSTITUTIONS THAT EXPERIENCED NO DAMAGE AT ALL EDUCATION DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS SAID THE CURRENT PROCESS WAS USED IN 2009 FOR NATURAL DISASTERS  THEY SAID THEY HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY ADMINISTERED THE APPLICATION IN SPANISH AND WOULD NOT DO SO NOW SO THEY CAN ADMINISTER AID AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE LILLIAN NEGRN COLN  PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSIDAD CENTRAL DE BAYAMN AND PRESIDENT OF ACUP  WROTE THAT THE DEPARTMENTS APPLICATION CONSTITUTES AN OVERWHELMING TASK AT A MOST CRITICAL POINT IN JUST A FEW MONTHS  THE ISLAND WILL BE ENTERING ITS 2018 HURRICANE SEASON  SHE SAID  AND OUR PEOPLE  INCLUDING US WHO ARE TRYING TO KEEP INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING OPERATIONAL  ARE STILL STRUGGLING

THE IMF S MIDEAST AND CENTRAL ASIA DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR   THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AZOUR  WHO SPOKE WITH THE ASSOCIATED PRESS FOR THE LAUNCH OF A NEW REPORT  SAID COUNTRIES IN THE REGION MUST PUSH AHEAD WITH DEEPER STRUCTURAL REFORMS  THE IMF IS URGING GOVERNMENTS TO UPGRADE THE SKILLS OF THEIR WORKFORCE AND PROVIDE THE PRIVATE SECTOR WITH GREATER ACCESS TO FINANCE THE IMF HAS ALSO ENCOURAGED MIDEAST OIL IMPORTERS AND EXPORTERS TO REDUCE SPENDING AND FIND NEW SOURCES OF REVENUE BY INTRODUCING NEW TAXES AND LIFTING SUBSIDIES  THIS YEAR  SAUDI ARABIA  THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES AND BAHRAIN

GOVERNANCE THE IMF PREDICTS GROWTH RATES OF ABOUT 4 9 PERCENT OVER THE COMING FIVE YEARS FOR OIL IMPORTING MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES  BUT SAYS THESE  GROWTH RATES REMAIN TOO LOW TO EFFECTIVELY REDUCE UNEMPLOYMENT  PARTICULARLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE THESE COUNTRIES  WHICH INCLUDE EGYPT  JORDAN  LEBANON  MOROCCO AND SYRIA  WOULD NEED SUSTAINED GROWTH OF AT LEAST 6 2 PERCENT A YEAR JUST TO KEEP UNEMPLOYMENT AT ITS CURRENT AVERAGE RATE OF 10 PERCENT  THE IMF REPORT FOUND THE IMF S UPDATED REGIONAL OUTLOOK SAYS THAT GOVERNMENTS IN THE REGION CONTINUE TO SPEND HEAVILY TO EMPLOY THEIR NATIONALS WITH LARGE AND GROWING PUBLIC SECTOR WAGE BILLS  DESPITE THIS  THE IMF SAYS  UNEMPLOYMENT HAS REMAINED HIGH  AND OVERLY GENEROUS PUBLIC SECTOR COMPENSATION HAS DISTORTED LABOR MARKETS IN GULF ARAB COUNTRIES THERE ARE NUMEROUS PERKS TO WORKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT  IN SOME OF THESE COUNTRIES  FOR EXAMPLE  THE IMF SAYS THE GAP BETWEEN PUBLIC SECTOR WAGES AND THOSE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS 200 PERCENT  MAKING GOVERNMENT JOBS THAT MUCH MORE COVETED AT 50 PERCENT  OMAN HAS THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT OF ANY ARAB COUNTRY  SEVENTY PERCENT OF WOMEN IN OMAN ARE ALSO OUTSIDE THE

MILLION NEW JOBS PER YEAR  HE SAID EGYPT MUST TAKE STEPS TO ALLOW THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO CREATE THESE JOBS SUSTAINABLY ALLOW THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO BE IN THE LEADING ROLE AND FOR THE STATE TO MOVE FROM BEING AN OPERATOR TO AN ENABLER  AND GIVE MORE ROOM FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO INVEST  HE SAID IN OIL EXPORTING IRAN  GROWTH HAS SLOWED OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS  IRAN RECENTLY ANNOUNCED IT WILL SWITCH

20180507,politics,election,9,WASHINGTON  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SIGNALED A MORE CONFRONTATIONAL LEGAL STRATEGY AGAINST THE SPECIAL COUNSEL S RUSSIA PROBE ON MONDAY  RIPPING INTO WHAT HE DISMISSED AS AN INVESTIGATION INTO A  MADE UP  PHONY CRIME HIS SERIES OF TWEETS WERE FRESH EVIDENCE THAT THE COOPERATIVE APPROACH WITH SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER THAT HAD BEEN ADVOCATED BY THE PRESIDENT S LEGAL TEAM FOR MONTHS HAS GONE BY THE WAYSIDE  IT ALSO REVEALED THE PRESIDENT S ANXIETY ABOUT HOW THE INVESTIGATION COULD SWAY VOTERS AS THEY DECIDE WHETHER TO KEEP CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS IN POWER OR FORCE HIM TO FACE AN AGGRESSIVE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY TRUMP S NEW LAWYER  FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR RUDY GIULIANI  HAS USED A STRING OF MEDIA APPEARANCES OVER THE PAST WEEK TO CAST THE PROBE AS A  TOTALLY GARBAGE INVESTIGATION  AND GIULIANI HAS CALLED INTO QUESTION WHETHER TRUMP WOULD BE TREATED FAIRLY BY MUELLER S PROSECUTORS IF HE WERE TO AGREE TO AN INTERVIEW NO DECISION HAS BEEN MADE ON WHETHER TO PERMIT THE PRESIDENT TO SIT FOR AN INTERVIEW  BUT A PERSON FAMILIAR WITH THE SITUATION BUT NOT AUTHORIZED TO SPEAK PUBLICLY ON IT TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS THAT THE LEGAL TEAM HOPES TO RESOLVE THAT QUESTION BY MAY 17  THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF MUELLER S APPOINTMENT  GIULIANI EARLIER TOLD THE WALL STREET JOURNAL THAT THE TEAM HOPES TO DECIDE BY THAT DATE MUELLER S TEAM IS INVESTIGATING RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016 ELECTION AND POSSIBLE COORDINATION WITH TRUMP ASSOCIATES AS WELL AS WHETHER THE PRESIDENT OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE  SO FAR  THE SPECIAL COUNSEL S OFFICE HAS CHARGED 19 PEOPLE  INCLUDING FOUR TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISERS  AND THREE RUSSIAN COMPANIES ON MONDAY  TRUMP SEIZED ON GIULIANI S MESSAGE  FOCUSING ON WHAT HE SEES AS THE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ON MUELLER S TEAM THE 13 ANGRY DEMOCRATS IN CHARGE OF THE RUSSIAN WITCH HUNT ARE STARTING TO FIND OUT THAT THERE IS A COURT SYSTEM IN PLACE THAT ACTUALLY PROTECTS PEOPLE FROM INJUSTICE AND JUST WAIT  TILL THE COURTS GET TO SEE YOUR UNREVEALED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST  HE WROTE TRUMP APPEARED TO BE DRAWING ATTENTION TO A FEDERAL JUDGE S QUESTIONING LAST WEEK OF MUELLER S AUTHORITY IN A CASE AGAINST FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN PAUL MANAFORT  BUT IT WAS UNCLEAR WHAT LEGAL ACTION TRUMP WAS REFERRING TO THAT WOULD TOUCH ON  UNREVEALED  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST MUELLER IS A LONGTIME REPUBLICAN  BUT SOME MEMBERS OF HIS TEAM HAVE MADE POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO DEMOCRATS  INCLUDING TO HILLARY CLINTON  TRUMP S DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT IN THE 2016 ELECTION MUELLER COULD NOT HAVE BARRED THEM FROM SERVING ON THE TEAM BASED SOLELY ON THEIR POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS  FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND JUSTICE DEPARTMENT POLICY PROHIBIT THE CONSIDERATION OF POLITICAL AFFILIATION IN HIRING AND OTHER PERSONNEL ACTIONS INVOLVING CAREER ATTORNEYS IN CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY  DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN HAS DEFENDED MUELLER S TEAM AGAINST CRITICISM THAT IT WAS POLITICALLY TAINTED WE RECOGNIZE WE HAVE EMPLOYEES WITH POLITICAL OPINIONS  AND IT S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THOSE OPINIONS DO NOT INFLUENCE THEIR ACTIONS  ROSENSTEIN SAID  ADDING   I BELIEVE THAT DIRECTOR MUELLER UNDERSTANDS THAT AND THAT HE IS RUNNING THAT OFFICE APPROPRIATELY MUELLER S INVESTIGATION HAS OPERATED LARGELY IN SECRECY WITH THE PUBLIC ONLY GETTING GLIMPSES INTO ITS OPERATION THROUGH WITNESSES WHO ARE QUESTIONED OR WHEN INDICTMENTS AND GUILTY PLEAS ARE PUBLICLY UNSEALED IT S UNCLEAR WHEN THE INVESTIGATION WILL CONCLUDE  A FACT THAT TRUMP SEIZED ON AS HE WORRIED THAT IT COULD AFFECT REPUBLICAN CHANCES IN THE NOVEMBER MIDTERM ELECTIONS IS THIS PHONY WITCH HUNT GOING TO GO ON EVEN LONGER SO IT WRONGFULLY IMPACTS THE MID TERM ELECTIONS  WHICH IS WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ALWAYS INTENDED  TRUMP TWEETED   REPUBLICANS BETTER GET TOUGH AND SMART BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITIES IN EITHER THE HOUSE OR SENATE WOULD GIVE THE PRESIDENT S POLITICAL OPPONENTS SUBPOENA POWER TO INVESTIGATE THE ADMINISTRATION  AND WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS HAVE PRIVATELY EXPRESSED CONCERNS THAT REPUBLICANS MAY LOSE THE HOUSE IN NOVEMBER ASKED ABOUT THE TWEET ON MONDAY  WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS SAID TRUMP WAS REFERRING TO  THE FACT THAT WE RE STILL TALKING ABOUT IT SANDERS SAID   I THINK THE POINT HE S MAKING IS HOW RIDICULOUS IT IS THAT WE RE STILL HAVING THIS CONVERSATION AND THE DEPTHS TO WHICH THIS RESEARCH HAS GONE ON AND INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN CONDUCTED AND STILL PRODUCED NOTHING IN HIS TWEETS  TRUMP ALSO TOOK ISSUE WITH MUELLER S INVESTIGATION INTO WHETHER HE OBSTRUCTED THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION  TO THAT  TRUMP WROTE   THERE IS NO O  IT S CALLED FIGHTING BACK HE ALSO CRITICIZED FBI LAWYER LISA PAGE AND FBI AGENT PETER STRZOK  WHO MADE HEADLINES FOR EXCHANGING DEROGATORY TEXT

20180507,business,business,5,OMAHA  ELON MUSK IS TAKING ON WARREN BUFFETT  AND THEIR DIFFERENCES RUN DEEPER THAN JOKES ABOUT CANDY AND MEDIEVAL FORTIFICATIONS AT BERKSHIRE HATHAWAYS ANNUAL MEETING OVER THE WEEKEND  I RELAYED A QUESTION FROM A SHAREHOLDER TO MR  BUFFETT ABOUT A COMMENT MR  MUSK HAD MADE A COUPLE DAYS EARLIER I THINK MOATS ARE LAME  MR  MUSK HAD SAID DURING A TESLA EARNINGS CALL  IT WAS A CRITICISM OF AN ECONOMIC PRINCIPLE THAT MR  BUFFETT HAD COINED IN 1999 AND THAT HAS BECOME SOMETHING OF A MANTRA FOR HIS FAITHFUL  INVEST IN BUSINESSES THAT HAVE WIDE  SUSTAINABLE MOATS AROUND THEM SUCH MOATS  MR  BUFFETT HAS SAID  ARE MADE OF THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES THAT BENEFIT MAJOR BRANDS AND COMPANIES  LIKE DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS  PRICING POWER AND BRAND REPUTATION BUT TO MR  MUSK  THEY ARE A METAPHOR FOR BEING STUCK IN THE PAST  IF YOUR ONLY DEFENSE AGAINST INVADING ARMIES IS A MOAT  YOU WILL NOT LAST LONG  HE SAID  WHAT MATTERS IS THE PACE OF INNOVATION  THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL DETERMINANT OF COMPETITIVENESS AT A TIME WHEN TECHNOLOGY IS UPENDING EVEN OLD LINE INDUSTRIES THAT ONCE SEEMED IMPENETRABLE TO COMPETITION  MIGHT MR  MUSK BE RIGHT ELON MAY TURN THINGS UPSIDE DOWN IN SOME AREAS  MR  BUFFETT SAID  I DONT THINK HED WANT TO TAKE US ON IN CANDY  SUGGESTING BERKSHIRES SEES CANDIES DIVISION ENJOYED AN UNASSAILABLY WIDE MOAT  THE QUIP ELICITED LAUGHTER FROM THE 20 000 SHAREHOLDERS WHO PACKED THE CENTURYLINK CENTER MR  MUSK ANSWERED THE CHALLENGE IMMEDIATELY  SAYING HE WAS STARTING A CANDY COMPANY  AND ITS GOING TO BE AMAZING  HE WROTE ON TWITTER NOT ONLY THAT  MR  MUSK SAID  HE PLANNED TO BUILD A MOAT AND FILL IT WITH CANDY  MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR MR  BUFFETT TO RESIST SINKING HIS MONEY INTO THE VENTURE THE REPARTEE WAS GOOD FOR SOME CHUCKLES AND CLICKBAIT HEADLINES  BUT THE MINI SPAT MASKED A MORE SERIOUS AND SIGNIFICANT DEBATE TAKING PLACE ACROSS CORPORATE AMERICA  HAVE THE TRADITIONAL MOATS SHRUNK WHEN DIRECT TO CONSUMER BRANDS LIKE DOLLAR SHAVE CLUB HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ON CONSUMER GIANTS LIKE PROCTER   GAMBLES GILLETTE  SO MUCH SO THAT UNILEVER BOUGHT DOLLAR SHAVE CLUB FOR  BILLION  ARE ANY BUSINESSES STILL SAFE  MR  BUFFETT OWNS KRAFT HEINZ  FOR EXAMPLE  BUT COULD UPSTART FOOD COMPANIES ONE DAY OVERTAKE IT  BREAKING THROUGH THE SUBSTANTIAL NETWORK OF DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS  AND BRAND LOYALTY  THAT KRAFT HEINZ HAS BUILT UP OVER DECADES MR  BUFFETT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT TIMES HAD CHANGED  THERE HAVE BEEN MORE MOATS THAT HAVE BECOME SUSCEPTIBLE TO INVASION THAN SEEMED TO BE THE CASE EARLIER  HE SAID TO A LARGE DEGREE  MR  MUSK IS A LIVING EMBODIMENT OF A GLEEFUL INVADER  WITH TESLA  HE IS TRYING TO PROVE THAT WHAT WAS LONG THOUGHT OF AS A SUBSTANTIAL MOAT AROUND THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY COULD BE OVERCOME  HE HAS GONE DIRECT TO CONSUMER WITH TESLA VEHICLES  BYPASSING THE TRADITIONAL CAR DEALERS THAT WERE ONCE CONSIDERED A BARRIER TO ENTERING THE AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS  HE EVEN HAD WHAT SEEMED LIKE HIS OWN MOAT  A NETWORK OF SUPERCHARGER STATIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT HE RECENTLY OPENED UP TO COMPETITORS   HIS INITIAL PANNING OF THE MOAT IDEA FOLLOWED A QUESTION ABOUT WHY HE WAS WILLING TO CEDE THE ADVANTAGE THAT THE CLOSED CHARGING NETWORK PROVIDED BUT  IN TRUTH  MR  MUSKS EXPERIENCE  AND CHALLENGES  AT TESLA MAY DEMONSTRATE JUST HOW MUCH A MOAT REMAINS A POWERFUL DETERRENT TO COMPETITORS IN THE CASE OF THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY  PERHAPS THE BIGGEST BARRIER IS THE HUGE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL NEEDED  TESLA HAS ALREADY RAISED MORE THAN  BILLION  BUT EVEN WITH HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY  TESLAS RECENT PRODUCTION STRUGGLES  IT HAS REPEATEDLY MISSED ITS TARGETS FOR MAKING THE NEW MASS MARKET MODEL 3  SHOW THE IMMENSE VALUE OF MANUFACTURING EXPERIENCE MR  MUSKS WILLINGNESS TO CHALLENGE CONVENTION HAS CLEARLY PUSHED THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY FORWARD  BUT HIS PROGRESS HAS LATELY BEEN BUMPIER THAN HE INITIALLY EXPECTED  THATS NOT TO SAY HE WONT SUCCEED  BUT IF HE DOES  HE MAY BE THE EXCEPTION  NOT THE RULE THERE ARE STILL HUGE SWATHS OF OUR ECONOMY THAT HAVE DAUNTINGLY WIDE MOATS  MANY OF THEM PROTECTED BY REGULATORY WALLS  BANKS  WHICH HAVE BEEN SPECULATED ABOUT AS RIPE FOR DISRUPTION BY FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES  SEEM MORE LIKELY TO BUY START UPS THAN COMPETE AGAINST THEM  AIRLINES  WHICH MR  BUFFETT ONCE CALLED A DEATH TRAP FOR INVESTORS  HAVE CONSOLIDATED  AND ENORMOUS CORPORATIONS CONTROL VIRTUALLY ALL THE LANDING SLOTS AT AIRPORTS AROUND THE GLOBE  BEFORE IT COULD GET OFF THE GROUND  ANY INSURGENT HOPING TO CHALLENGE THEM WOULD HAVE TO FIND A SPOT TO COME DOWN EVEN MANY DIGITAL BUSINESSES HAVE A MOAT  GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK CONTROL SO MUCH OF THE ADVERTISING MARKET THAT IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW A KID IN A GARAGE WITH AN IDEA COULD USURP THEM ANYTIME SOON  AMAZON HAS ITSELF HAS BECOME SO POWERFUL THAT VIRTUALLY EVERY SELLER FEELS IT HAS TO GO THROUGH IT  AND MR  BUFFETT HAS CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT APPLES DEEP RELATIONSHIP WITH ITS CUSTOMERS THROUGH ITS ECOSYSTEM OF PRODUCTS AND ICLOUD MEAN THE BUSINESS HAS A DEFENSIBLE MOAT THERE ARE SOME PRETTY GOOD MOATS AROUND  MR  BUFFETT SAID  BEING THE LOW COST PRODUCER  FOR EXAMPLE  IS A TERRIBLY IMPORTANT MOAT  HE SAID  CITING GEICO  THE LOW COST INSURANCE COMPANY BERKSHIRE OWNS SATURDAY NIGHT  AFTER THE BERKSHIRE MEETING ENDED  MR  MUSK WAS STILL TWEETING  SAYING YOU LIKE MOATS IS JUST A NICE WAY OF SAYING YOU LIKE OLIGOPOLIES FOR BETTER OR WORSE  THE LIMITED COMPETITION THAT OLIGOPOLIES FACE IS USUALLY GOOD FOR INVESTORS  EVEN IF CONSUMERS MIGHT DISAGREE BUT WHETHER THEY HAVE BEEN DUG BY A COMPANYS EXPERIENCED HAND  THE GOOD WILL OF ITS CUSTOMERS OR THE HEAVY MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION  MOATS REMAIN A FORMIDABLE FORM OF PROTECTION  EVEN FROM THE MOST WILLING OF RAIDERS PERHAPS CHARLIE MUNGER  BERKSHIRES VICE CHAIRMAN  PUT IT BEST  ELON SAYS A CONVENTIONAL MOAT IS QUAINT  AND THATS TRUE OF A PUDDLE OF WATER
20180503,politics,politics,4,WASHINGTON  THE DISCLOSURE BY RUDOLPH W  GIULIANI THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP REPAID HIS LONGTIME PERSONAL LAWYER  MICHAEL D  COHEN  FOR THE  000 HUSH MONEY PAYMENT MADE TO A PORNOGRAPHIC ACTRESS SHORTLY BEFORE THE 2016 ELECTION HAS PUT NEW SCRUTINY ON THE LEGAL ISSUES RAISED BY THE UNUSUAL TRANSACTION MR  TRUMP HAS NEVER REPORTED THIS EXPENDITURE  LOAN OR REPAYMENT  EITHER IN CAMPAIGN FILINGS WITH THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION OR ON HIS FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORM WITH THE GOVERNMENT ETHICS OFFICE  BUT IT REMAINS MURKY WHAT EXACTLY MR  TRUMP KNEW  AND WHEN HE LEARNED IT DO CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS APPLY A THRESHOLD QUESTION IS WHETHER THE PAYMENT TO THE ACTRESS  STEPHANIE CLIFFORD  WHO GOES BY THE STAGE NAME STORMY DANIELS  WAS INTENDED TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION BY SUPPRESSING A CLAIM THAT COULD HURT MR  TRUMPS CHANCES  IF SO  THE TRANSACTION WAS MOST LIKELY COVERED BY FEDERAL CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS THOSE LAWS BARRED CANDIDATES SUPPORTERS FROM MAKING DONATIONS  INCLUDING IN KIND DONATIONS  WORTH MORE THAN  700 TO PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS DURING THE 2016 GENERAL ELECTION  AND WHILE THOSE LAWS ALLOW CANDIDATES TO SPEND AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF THEIR OWN MONEY TO HELP THEIR CAMPAIGNS  THEY REQUIRE THE CANDIDATES TO DISCLOSE SUCH SELF FUNDING  BOTH AS DONATIONS TO THEIR CAMPAIGNS AND AS EXPENDITURES  BUT IF THE MOTIVE FOR THE PAYMENT WAS UNRELATED TO THE ELECTION  THEN IT WAS NOT COVERED BY THOSE LAWS RECENT HISTORY SUGGESTS THAT IT CAN BE TRICKY TO PROVE THAT THE MOTIVE BEHIND SUCH A PAYMENT WAS POLITICAL RATHER THAN PERSONAL  IN 2012  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PROSECUTED JOHN EDWARDS  THE FORMER DEMOCRATIC SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA  OVER PAYMENTS FROM WEALTHY DONORS THAT WERE USED TO HIDE HIS PREGNANT MISTRESS WHILE HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT  MR  EDWARDSS LAWYERS ARGUED THAT HE WAS INSTEAD TRYING TO HIDE THE AFFAIR FROM HIS WIFE IN THE END  A JURY ACQUITTED MR  EDWARDS OF ONE CHARGE WHILE DEADLOCKING ON THE OTHER FIVE  AND PROSECUTORS OPTED NOT TO SEEK A NEW TRIAL  RICHARD L  HASEN  A PROFESSOR OF LAW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA  IRVINE  SAID THAT AFTER THE EDWARDS MISTRIAL  FEDERAL PROSECUTORS WILL BE RELUCTANT TO GO FORWARD WITH SIMILAR CASES UNLESS THEY HAVE DOCUMENTARY PROOF  A SMOKING GUN  THAT A PAYMENT WAS IN FACT ELECTION RELATED WHAT IS THE ARGUMENT THAT THE PAYMENT WAS NOT CAMPAIGN RELATED IN AN INTERVIEW ON THURSDAY ON THE FOX NEWS PROGRAM FOX   FRIENDS  MR  GIULIANI INSISTED THAT THE PAYMENT WAS NOT A CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION  HE SAID MR  COHEN WAS TRYING TO HELP MR  TRUMPS FAMILY TO SAVE THEIR MARRIAGE  NOT THEIR MARRIAGE SO MUCH AS THEIR REPUTATION  BUT THEN  MUDDYING THAT MESSAGE  MR  GIULIANI SAID  IMAGINE IF THAT CAME OUT ON OCT  15  2016  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST DEBATE WITH HILLARY CLINTON  SEPARATELY  IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE NEW YORK TIMES  MR  GIULIANI ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT COULD OVERLAP AS A CAMPAIGN PROBLEM  BUT REITERATED THAT MR  TRUMP WAS NOT THINKING OF THE PAYMENT AS A CAMPAIGN EXPENSE IT COULD WORK IN MR  TRUMPS FAVOR THAT HE AND HIS LAWYERS HAD A LONG HISTORY OF USING LEGAL AVENUES TO TRY TO FIGHT OFF DAMAGING CLAIMS  THAT HISTORY COULD FORM THE BASIS OF AN ARGUMENT THAT MR  COHENS PAYMENT TO MS  CLIFFORD  AND MR  TRUMPS REIMBURSEMENT OF IT  WOULD HAVE HAPPENED WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IF THIS WAS A FIRST TIME CANDIDATE WITHOUT A PUBLIC REPUTATION  THEN IT WOULD BE HARDER TO ARGUE THAT IT WASNT AN EXPENDITURE TO INFLUENCE AN ELECTION  SAID CHARLES SPIES  A REPUBLICAN ELECTION LAWYER WHO WORKED IN SUPPORT OF ONE OF MR  TRUMPS RIVALS  THE FORMER FLORIDA GOVERNOR JEB BUSH  IN THE 2016 REPUBLICAN PRIMARY  BUT DONALD TRUMP HAS A LONG RECORD OF AGGRESSIVELY DEFENDING HIS REPUTATION FROM ATTACKS THAT TRACK RECORD COULD PROVE LESS COMPELLING IF THE AUTHORITIES OBTAIN EVIDENCE THAT MR  COHEN PRIVATELY DISCUSSED THE PAYMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF MR  TRUMPS CAMPAIGN  LAST MONTH  FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS IN NEW YORK RAIDED MR  COHENS OFFICE AND HOTEL ROOM  CARTING AWAY NUMEROUS DOCUMENTS AND ELECTRONIC DEVICES THAT ARE NOW THE SUBJECT OF A FIGHT OVER ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE  ONE OF THE THINGS THEY ARE APPARENTLY INVESTIGATING IS THE PAYMENT TO MS  CLIFFORD IF THE PAYMENT WAS A LOAN  IS COHEN OUT OF TROUBLE NOT IF THE LOAN WAS INTENDED TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION  CAMPAIGNS ROUTINELY TAKE OUT LARGE LOANS FROM BANKS WHEN THEYRE RUNNING SHORT OF CASH AHEAD OF ELECTIONS  BUT FEDERAL ELECTION LAWS REQUIRE THAT THOSE LOANS COME FROM BANKS AS ROUTINE BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS  PERSONAL LOANS COUNT AS CONTRIBUTIONS THAT ARE STILL LEGALLY CAPPED AT THE INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION LIMIT  EVEN IF THEY ARE LATER REPAID IN FULL  ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION WEBSITE WHEN WOULD THIS HAVE HAD TO BE REPORTED  AND BY WHOM IF THE PAYMENT WERE TO BE DEEMED CAMPAIGN RELATED  THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SHOULD HAVE DISCLOSED IT IN ITS PERIODIC FILINGS WITH THE F E C  AS SOON AS MR  TRUMP OR HIS CAMPAIGN LEARNED THAT MR  COHEN HAD MADE IT  IF MR  TRUMP OR HIS CAMPAIGN ONLY DISCOVERED THE PAYMENT AFTER THE FACT  THEY SHOULD HAVE AMENDED THEIR PREVIOUS FILINGS TO REFLECT THE EXPENDITURE  AND ANY REIMBURSEMENTS TO MR  COHEN  THE WALL STREET JOURNAL FIRST REPORTED THE  000 PAYMENT TO MS  CLIFFORD IN JANUARY  AND MR  TRUMP HAS NOT MOVED TO AMEND HIS DISCLOSURES IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE TIMES  MR  GIULIANI WAS VAGUE ABOUT KEY QUESTIONS CONCERNING WHAT MR  TRUMP KNEW AND WHEN HE KNEW IT  SAYING THAT MR  TRUMP DID KNOW THAT THERE WAS A FORM OF REIMBURSEMENTS TO MR  COHEN OVER THE COURSE OF 2017  BUT MAINTAINING THAT THE PRESIDENT DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS FOR SPECIFICALLY  MR  GIULIANI ALSO SAID THAT SOME EXECUTIVES AT THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION KNEW ABOUT THE FACT THAT COHEN BELIEVES MONEY WAS OWED TO HIM  I DONT KNOW WHEN THAT CAME UP MIGHT A LOAN RAISE NON ELECTION LAW ISSUES YES  AS A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE  MR  TRUMP IS ALSO REQUIRED TO REPORT ANY LIABILITIES IN EXCESS OF  000 ON A FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORM FILED WITH THE OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT ETHICS  HIS 2017 FORM  WHICH HE SIGNED IN JUNE  CERTIFYING IT WAS TRUE  COMPLETE AND CORRECT  DOES NOT LIST ANY OUTSTANDING LOAN FROM MR  COHEN  CAMPAIGN RELATED OR OTHERWISE  WHEN HE SPOKE WITH THE TIMES ON THURSDAY  MR  GIULIANI DID NOT ANSWER WHY THE MONEY WAS NOT LISTED ON THE PRESIDENTS FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORM WHAT COULD THE PENALTIES BE WHEN CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATIONS ARE PUNISHED  THEY TYPICALLY RESULT IN FINES BY THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION THAT ARE PEGGED TO THE SIZE OF THE UNLAWFUL CONTRIBUTION OR EXPENDITURE  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CAN ALSO PROSECUTE WILLFUL VIOLATIONS OF ELECTION LAWS  OR WILLFUL FALSE STATEMENTS ON THE FEDERAL PERSONAL FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORMS  WHICH ARE FELONIES AND CAN RESULT IN UP TO FIVE YEARS IN PRISON THERE IS LITTLE CHANCE THAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD FILE CHARGES AGAINST MR  TRUMP  REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE EVIDENCE SHOWS  BECAUSE ITS OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL HAS OPINED THAT THE CONSTITUTION MAKES SITTING PRESIDENTS IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION BUT MR  COHEN  AFTER THE RAID LAST MONTH  IS UNDER INTENSE LEGAL PRESSURE

20180506,business,finance,6,WASHINGTON  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP S NEW ATTORNEY RUDY GIULIANI IS DELIVERING CONFOUNDING AND AT TIMES CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS AS HE TRIES TO LESSEN THE LEGAL BURDENS ON HIS CLIENT FROM AN INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016 ELECTION AND A  000 HUSH PAYMENT TO A PORN ACTRESS THE FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR IS EMBRACING HIS CLIENT S PREFERRED APPROACH TO CHALLENGES AS HE MOUNTS TRUMP S DEFENSE THROUGH THE MEDIA  BUT IT S PROVING TO BE A BEWILDERING DISPLAY IN AN INTERVIEW SUNDAY WITH ABC S  THIS WEEK  GIULIANI DISMISSED AS RUMOR HIS OWN STATEMENTS ABOUT TRUMP S PAYMENT TO ADULT FILM ACTRESS STORMY DANIELS  SAID HE CAN T SPEAK TO WHETHER THE PRESIDENT LIED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN HE DENIED KNOWLEDGE OF THE SILENCING AGREEMENT AND WOULDN T RULE OUT THE PRESIDENT ASSERTING HIS FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHT AGAINST SELF INCRIMINATION IN THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION  GIULIANI ALSO COULDN T SAY WHETHER TRUMP S PERSONAL LAWYER  MICHAEL COHEN  HAD MADE

SUGGESTED THAT TRUMP WOULDN T NECESSARILY COMPLY WITH A SUBPOENA FROM MUELLER  WHOSE INVESTIGATION TRUMP HAS REPEATEDLY LABELED A  WITCH HUNT A SUBPOENA FIGHT WOULD LIKELY FIND ITS WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT  WHICH HAS NEVER FIRMLY DECIDED WHETHER PRESIDENTS CAN BE COMPELLED TO SPEAK UNDER OATH GIULIANI S AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE OF THE PRESIDENT IN RECENT WEEKS HAS PLEASED TRUMP BUT EXASPERATED WHITE

SAID SUNDAY ON CNN S  STATE OF THE UNION  THAT TRUMP MEANT THAT HE DIDN T KNOW ABOUT THE PAYMENT AT THE TIME IT WAS MADE  NOT AT THE TIME THE QUESTION WAS ASKED GIULIANI SAID LAST WEEK THAT TRUMP HAD REIMBURSED COHEN FOR THAT PAYMENT AND OTHER UNSPECIFIED ITEMS GIULIANI SAID THEN THAT HE FIRST MADE TRUMP AWARE OF THE PAYMENT SHORTLY AFTER JOINING THE CASE BUT NOW SAYS HE DOESN T KNOW WHEN TRUMP FOUND OUT ABOUT IT  GIULIANI TOLD BUZZFEED LAST WEEK THAT COHEN HAD COMPLAINED AFTER THE ELECTION ABOUT NOT BEING PAID BY TRUMP FOR HIS WORK IN SILENCING DANIELS AND THAT COHEN AND TRUMP THEN MET TO WORK OUT A  000 MONTHLY RETAINER TRUMP SAID FRIDAY THAT GIULIANI NEEDED TO  GET HIS FACTS STRAIGHT  BUT INSISTED THEY WEREN T CHANGING THEIR STORY  HE HAS CALLED DANIELS  ALLEGATIONS OF AN AFFAIR  FALSE AND EXTORTIONIST WHEN ASKED SUNDAY WHETHER TRUMP KNEW ABOUT THE PAYMENT TO DANIELS AFTER THE CAMPAIGN  GIULIANI DEMURRED I CAN T PROVE THAT  I CAN JUST SAY IT S RUMOR  GIULIANI SAID GIULIANI ALSO SAID HE WASN T SURE WHETHER COHEN HAD PAID OFF ANY OTHER WOMEN FOR TRUMP BUT INDICATED IT WAS POSSIBLE I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THAT  BUT I WOULD THINK IF IT WAS NECESSARY  YES  GIULIANI SAID COHEN NO LONGER REPRESENTS TRUMP  GIULIANI SAID  ADDING THAT IT WOULD  BE A CONFLICT RIGHT NOW  COHEN FACES A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION IN NEW YORK  WHERE FBI AGENTS RAIDED HIS HOME AND OFFICE SEVERAL WEEKS AGO SEEKING RECORDS ABOUT THE DANIELS NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT AND OTHER MATTERS MICHAEL AVENATTI  DANIELS  ATTORNEY  SAID SUNDAY ON  THIS WEEK  THAT HE THINKS IT S  OBVIOUS   TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THIS IS A COVER UP  THAT THEY ARE MAKING IT UP AS THEY GO ALONG LEGAL EXPERTS HAVE SAID THE REVELATION THAT TRUMP REIMBURSED COHEN RAISES NEW QUESTIONS  INCLUDING WHETHER THE MONEY REPRESENTED REPAYMENT OF AN UNDISCLOSED LOAN OR COULD BE SEEN AS REIMBURSEMENT FOR A CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURE  EITHER COULD BE LEGALLY PROBLEMATIC BOTH GIULIANI AND TRUMP HAVE INSISTED THE PAYMENT TO DANIELS WAS NOT A CAMPAIGN EXPENSE GIULIANI MAINTAINED SUNDAY THAT THE PAYMENT CAN T BE CONSIDERED AN IN KIND CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION BECAUSE THERE WAS ANOTHER EXPLANATION FOR IT THIS WAS FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE  TO PROTECT HIM  TO PROTECT HIS FAMILY  HE SAID   IT MAY HAVE INVOLVED THE CAMPAIGN  DOESN T MATTER GIULIANI SAID THE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT WITH COHEN WASN T REVEALED ON TRUMP S 2017 PERSONAL FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE BECAUSE  IT ISN T A LIABILITY  IT S AN EXPENSE THIS VERSION OF THE STORY CORRECTS QUOTE IN PARAGRAPH 9 TO DELETE THE WORD  AMENDMENT  IN THE FIRST REFERENCE TO  THE FIFTH

MAJOR UNIONS  THE CGT  TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS   THE PRESIDENT SAID WE NEED CHANGES  BUT WE ALSO NEED TO TAKE CARE OF CITIZENS MACRON SAYS HIS ECONOMIC REFORMS AIM AT ATTRACTING MORE FRENCH AND FOREIGN INVESTORS INTO THE COUNTRY AND MAKING SURE THE FRENCH ECONOMY IS GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE AFTER YEARS OF STAGNATION OR RECESSION MANY ECONOMISTS SAY SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT WORKERS ARE PROTESTING  LIKE ELIMINATING JOBS FOR LIFE IN THE FRENCH RAILWAY SYSTEM OR BEING ALLOWED TO REDUCE STAFF IN A TOUGH BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT  ARE THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE FRENCH COMPANIES VIABLE IN THE 21ST CENTURY  WHERE BUSINESSES CONSTANTLY SEND JOBS ACROSS BORDERS AND AUTOMATION IS DRAMATICALLY CHANGING THE WORKPLACE BUT OPPONENTS DENOUNCE THE CHANGES AS WEAKENING FRANCE S OFTEN ENVIED WORKER PROTECTIONS

20180507,business,business,10,FOR SOME TIME NOW EVERYONE HAS BEEN WORRYING ABOUT FAKE NEWS OR THE WORLD OF ALTERNATIVE FACT AND WONDERING JUST HOW AND WHY THIS UNHAPPY PHENOMENON HAS FLOURISHED  MY TAKE ON THIS QUESTION IS SIMPLE  ALTHOUGH I HOPE NOT SIMPLE MINDED  FAKE NEWS IS IN LARGE PART A PRODUCT OF THE ENTHUSIASM  NOT TO SAY RAGE  FOR TRANSPARENCY AND ABSOLUTELY FREE SPEECH I KNOW THAT THIS IS A COUNTERINTUITIVE PROPOSITION  I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN MY DEFENSE OF IT WITH AN ANECDOTE IN NOVEMBER 2016  SCOTT TITSWORTH  DEAN OF THE SCRIPPS COLLEGE OF COMMUNICATION AT OHIO UNIVERSITY  INFORMED THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY OF THE FIRST MEETING OF A PRESIDENTIAL ADVISORY GROUP CHARGED WITH RECOMMENDING FREE SPEECH POLICIES FOR THE CAMPUS  TITSWORTH REPORTED THAT THE GROUPS FIRST ACTION WAS TO AFFIRM TRANSPARENCY AS ONE OF ITS CORE VALUES  THE SECOND ACTION WAS TO DECIDE  UNANIMOUSLY  THAT ITS MEETINGS WOULD NOT BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC  BUT HELD IN PRIVATE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE  IT WAS EASY TO MAKE FUN OF THE OBVIOUS CONTRADICTION  BUT THE CONTRADICTION IS NOT SO GLARING ONCE WE UNDERSTAND THAT TWO NOTIONS OF WHAT FREE MEANS ARE IN PLAY HERE  THE GROUP WANTS  UNDERSTANDABLY  TO BE FREE OF THE PRESSURES THAT WOULD BE FELT IF THE PROCEEDINGS WERE CONDUCTED UNDER PUBLIC SCRUTINY  AT EVERY MOMENT MEMBERS WOULD BE TEMPTED TO TAILOR WHAT THEY SAID TO THE RESPONSES AND CRITICISMS OF AN IMAGINED AUDIENCE  IN SHORT  THEY WOULD NOT BE SPEAKING FREELY BUT UNDER A SHADOW IF THE MEANING OF FREELY IN FORCE WERE ENTIRELY WITHOUT FILTERS  GATEKEEPERS AND BOUNDARIES THAT SENSE OF FREELY IS CHAMPIONED BY TECHNO UTOPIANS WHOSE MANTRA IS INFORMATION WANTS TO BE FREE AND WHO BELIEVE THAT THE PROMISED LAND PREDICTED BY THE AUTHORS OF EVERY TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCE  THE PRINTING PRESS  NEWSPAPERS  THE TELEGRAPH  THE RAILROAD  RADIO  TELEVISION  THE DIGITAL COMPUTER  THE INTERNET  IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER  IT IS A LAND IN WHICH DEMOCRACYS POTENTIAL IS FINALLY REALIZED IN A COMMUNICATION COMMUNITY WHERE ALL VOICES ARE RECOGNIZED AND NONE MARGINALIZED  WITH NO ONE HOARDING INFORMATION OR CONTROLLING ACCESS OR DECIDING WHO SPEAKS AND WHO DOESNT WHAT TITSWORTH AND HIS FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS SEE IS THAT THIS MORE AMBITIOUS AND ABSTRACT SENSE OF FREELY IS ANTITHETICAL TO THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THEIR TASK  NOT SPEAKING FREELY IN FRONT OF EVERYONE IS A CONDITION OF SPEAKING FREELY  WITHOUT ANXIETY AND MENTAL RESERVATION  ON THE WAY TO EXPLORING THE COMPLEXITIES AND DIFFICULTIES OF THEIR CHARGE THE MORAL  PROVISIONALLY  AND PERHAPS PREMATURELY  DRAWN  IS THAT TRANSPARENCY IS NOT UNAMBIGUOUSLY A GOOD THING   I PASS OVER FOR THE MOMENT THE PRIOR QUESTION OF WHETHER IT IS A POSSIBLE THING  AND IF THAT IS RIGHT  THEN THE PROLIFERATION OF SPEECH MAY NOT BE A GOOD THING EITHER  SILENCE AND THE WITHHOLDING AND SEQUESTERING OF SPEECH MAY BE USEFUL AND EVEN NECESSARY IN SOME CONTEXTS  LIKE THE PREPARING OF A REPORT OR MAINTAINING OF A MARRIAGE  I SAY THIS AWARE THAT MANY FREE SPEECH ADVOCATES BELIEVE THAT THE MORE FREE SPEECH THERE IS THE BETTER THE HUMAN CONDITION WILL BE  AND WHO BELIEVE  TOO  THAT IT IS THE BUSINESS OF OUR INSTITUTIONS  INCLUDING OUR LEGISLATURES AND COURTS  TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF SPEECH AVAILABLE AT FIRST GLANCE THE BIAS IN FAVOR OF UNLIMITED SPEECH AND INFORMATION SEEMS PERFECTLY REASONABLE AND EVEN UNASSAILABLE  WHAT ARGUMENTS COULD BE BROUGHT AGAINST IT  AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION HAS BEEN OFFERED IN RECENT YEARS BY A SMALL  BUT GROWING  NUMBER OF CRITICS IN A 2009 ESSAY IN THE NEW REPUBLIC TITLED AGAINST TRANSPARENCY  THE LAW PROFESSOR LAWRENCE LESSIG  KNOWN AS AN APOSTLE OF OPENNESS  ASKED  AS I JUST HAVE  HOW COULD ANYONE BE AGAINST TRANSPARENCY  LESSIG RESPONDS TO HIS OWN QUESTION BY QUOTING A TRIO OF AUTHORS WHO IN THEIR BOOK FULL DISCLOSURE  THE PERILS AND PROMISE OF TRANSPARENCY OBSERVE THAT BY ITSELF INFORMATION DOESNT DO ANYTHING  ITS EFFECTS DEPEND ON THE MOTIVES OF THOSE WHO MAKE USE OF IT  AND RAW INFORMATION  THAT IS  DATA  CANNOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN BENIGN AND MALIGN APPROPRIATIONS OF ITSELF  MISUNDERSTANDING AND MANIPULATION ARE ALWAYS MORE THAN POSSIBLE  AND THERE IS NO WAY TO ASSURE THAT NEW INFORMATION IS USED TO FURTHER PUBLIC OBJECTIVES ANOTHER WAY TO PUT THIS IS TO SAY THAT INFORMATION  DATA AND THE UNBOUNDED FLOW OF MORE AND MORE SPEECH CAN BE POLITICIZED  IT CAN  THAT IS  BE WOVEN INTO A NARRATIVE THAT CONSTRICTS RATHER THAN EXPANDS THE AREA OF FREE  RATIONAL CHOICE  WHEN THAT HAPPENS  AND IT WILL HAPPEN OFTEN  TRANSPARENCY AND THE UNBOUNDED FLOW OF SPEECH BECOME INSTRUMENTS IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE VERY INEQUALITIES  ECONOMIC  POLITICAL  EDUCATIONAL  THAT THE GOSPEL OF OPENNESS PROMISES TO REMOVE  AND THE MORE THIS GOSPEL IS PREACHED AND BELIEVED  THE MORE THAT THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING IS ASSUMED TO BE DATA UNCORRUPTED BY INTERESTS AND MOTIVES  THE EASIER IT WILL BE FOR INTEREST AND MOTIVES TO OPERATE UNDER TRANSPARENCYS COVER THIS IS SO BECAUSE SPEECH AND DATA PRESENTED AS IF THEY WERE INDEPENDENT OF ANY MECHANISM OF SELECTIVITY WILL FLOAT FREE OF THE STANDARDS OF JUDGMENT THAT ARE ALWAYS THE CONTENT OF SUCH MECHANISMS  REMOVING OR DENYING THE EXISTENCE OF GATEKEEPING PROCEDURES WILL RESULT NOT IN A FAIR AND OPEN FIELD OF TRANSPARENCY BUT IN A FIELD WHERE MANIPULATION AND DECEPTION FIND NO OBSTACLES  BECAUSE IT IS AN ARTICLE OF THEIR FAITH THAT POLITICS ARE BAD AND THE UNMEDIATED ENCOUNTER WITH DATA IS GOOD  INTERNET PROPHETS WILL FAIL TO SEE THE POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO  FOR IN THEIR EYES POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS ARE WHAT THEY ARE DOING AWAY WITH INDEED  THEIR DEEPEST CLAIM  SO DEEP THAT THEY ARE LARGELY UNAWARE OF IT  IS THAT POLITICS CAN BE ELIMINATED  THEY DONT REGARD POLITICS AS AN UNAVOIDABLE FEATURE OF MORTAL LIFE BUT AS AN UNHAPPY CONSEQUENCE OF THE SECULAR EQUIVALENT OF THE TOWER OF BABEL  TOO MANY LANGUAGES  TOO MANY POINTS OF VIEW  POLITICS  FACTION AND DIFFERENCE  WILL JUST WITHER AWAY WHEN THE DEFECT THAT GENERATES IT  DISTORTED COMMUNICATION  HAS BEEN ELIMINATED BY UNMODIFIED DATA CIRCULATED FREELY AMONG FREE AND EQUAL CONSUMERS  EVERYONE WILL BE ON THE SAME PAGE  READING FROM THE SAME SCRIPT AND APPREHENDING THE SAME UNIVERSAL MEANINGS  BACK TO EDEN THIS UTOPIAN FANTASY RESTS ON A POSITIVE  VAGUELY PERFECTIONIST VIEW OF HUMAN NATURE  RATHER THAN BEING DOOMED BY ORIGINAL SIN TO CONFLICT  PREJUDICE  HATRED AND AN INSATIABLE WILL TO POWER  MEN AND WOMEN ARE BY NATURE COMMUNITARIAN  INCLINED TO FELLOWSHIP AND THE SEEKING OF COMMON GROUND  THESE GOOD INSTINCTS  WE ARE TOLD  HAVE BEEN BLOCKED BY LINGUISTIC DIFFERENCES THAT CAN NOW BE TRANSCENDED BY THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION A MEMORABLE FACEBOOK NEWS RELEASE WRITTEN BY MARK ZUCKERBERG A FEW YEARS BACK  CITED BY EVGENY MOROZOV IN HIS BOOK TO SAVE EVERYTHING  CLICK HERE TELLS THE HAPPY AND OPTIMISTIC STORY  BY ENABLING PEOPLE FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS TO EASILY CONNECT AND SHARE THEIR IDEAS  WE CAN DECREASE WORLD CONFLICT IN THE SHORT AND LONG RUN  THE IDEA  MOROZOV EXPLAINS  IS THAT FACTIONS AND CONFLICT ARE SIMPLY THE UNFORTUNATE RESULT OF AN IMPERFECT COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE  IF WE PERFECT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE BY DEVISING A LANGUAGE OF DATA ALGORITHMS AND INSTANTANEOUS ELECTRONIC INTERACTION THAT BYPASSES INTERVENING AND DISTORTING INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE STATE  THEN COMMUNICATION WOULD BE PERFECT AND UNDISTORTED  AND SOCIETY WOULD BE SET ON THE RIGHT PATH WITHOUT ANY FURTHER POLITICAL EFFORTS REQUIRED  TALK ABOUT MAGICAL THINKING IN THE ALTERNATIVE AND TRUE STORY REHEARSED BY MANY  HUMAN DIFFERENCE IS IRREDUCIBLE  AND THERE IS NO NEUTRAL OBSERVATION LANGUAGE  A TERM OF THE PHILOSOPHER THOMAS KUHNS IN HIS 1962 BOOK THE STRUCTURE OF SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONS  THAT CAN BRIDGE  SOFTEN  BLUR AND EVEN ERASE THE DIFFERENCES  WHEN PEOPLE FROM OPPOSING CONSTITUENCIES CLASH THERE IS NO COMMON LANGUAGE TO WHICH THEY CAN REFER THEIR DIFFERENCES FOR MECHANICAL RESOLUTION  THERE ARE ONLY POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS THAT WOULD INVOLVE NOT TRUTH TELLING BUT PROPAGANDA  THREATS  INSULTS  DECEPTIONS  EXAGGERATIONS  INSINUATIONS  BLUFFS  POSTURINGS  ALL THE FORMS OF VERBAL MANIPULATION THAT WILL SUPPOSEDLY DISAPPEAR IN THE INTERNET NIRVANA THEY WONT  INDEED  THEY WILL PROLIFERATE BECAUSE THE POLITICALLY ANGLED SPEECH THAT IS SUPPOSEDLY THE SOURCE OF OUR PROBLEMS IS IN FACT THE ONLY POSSIBLE ROUTE TO THEIR  NO DOUBT TEMPORARY  SOLUTION  SPEECH PROCEEDING FROM A POINT OF VIEW CAN AT LEAST BE RECOGNIZED AS SUCH AND THEN COUNTERED  YOU SAY  I KNOW WHERE THOSE GUYS ARE COMING FROM  AND HERE ARE MY REASONS FOR BELIEVING THAT WE SHOULD BE COMING FROM SOME PLACE ELSE  AND DIALOGUE BEGINS  IT IS DIALOGUE INFLECTED BY INTERESTS AND AGENDAS  BUT DIALOGUE STILL  BUT WHEN SPEECH  OR INFORMATION OR DATA  IS JUST SITTING THERE INERT  UNATTACHED TO ANY PERSPECTIVE  WHEN THERE ARE NO GUIDELINES  MONITORS  GATEKEEPERS OR FILTERS  WHAT YOU HAVE ARE INNUMERABLE BITS  LIKE LEGO  AVAILABLE FOR ASSIMILATION INTO ANY PROJECT A CLEVER VERBAL ENGINEER MIGHT IMAGINE  AND WHAT YOU DONT HAVE IS ANY MECHANISM THAT CAN STOP OR CHALLENGE THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT OR EVEN ASSESS IT  WHAT YOU HAVE  IN SHORT  ARE THE PERFECT CONDITIONS FOR THE UNCHECKED PROLIFERATION OF WHAT HAS COME TO BE CALLED FAKE NEWS THE RISE OF FAKE NEWS HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED BY SOME TO THE EMERGENCE OF POSTMODERN THOUGHT  VICTOR DAVIS HANSON  A SCHOLAR AT THE HOOVER INSTITUTION AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY WROTE IN 2017 THAT FAKE NEWS CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THE CAMPUS  SPECIFICALLY TO ACADEMIC POSTMODERNISM  WHICH HANSON SAYS  DERIDES FACTS AND ABSOLUTES  AND INSISTS THAT THERE ARE ONLY NARRATIVES AND INTERPRETATIONS THATS NOT QUITE RIGHT  THE INSISTENCE ON THE PRIMACY OF NARRATIVES AND INTERPRETATIONS DOES NOT INVOLVE A DERIDING OF FACTS BUT AN ALTERNATIVE STORY OF THEIR EMERGENCE  POSTMODERNISM SETS ITSELF AGAINST THE NOTION OF FACTS JUST LYING THERE DISCRETE AND INDEPENDENT  AND WAITING TO BE DESCRIBED  INSTEAD IT ARGUES THAT FACT IS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ARGUMENT AND DEBATE  NOT A PRE EXISTING ENTITY BY WHOSE MEASURE ARGUMENT CAN BE ASSESSED  ARGUMENTS COME FIRST  WHEN THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL  FACTS FOLLOW  AT LEAST FOR A WHILE  UNTIL A NEW ROUND OF ARGUMENTS REPLACES THEM WITH A NEW SET OF FACTS THIS IS FAR FROM THE PICTURE OF NIETZSCHEAN NIHILISM THAT HANSON AND OTHERS PAINT  FRICTION  NOT FREE INVENTION  IS THE HEART OF THE PROCESS  YOU COMMIT YOURSELF TO THE STANDARDS OF EVIDENCE LONG IN PLACE IN THE CONVERSATION YOU ENTER  AND THEN YOU MANEUVER AS BEST YOU CAN WITHIN THE GUIDELINES OF THOSE STANDARDS  THUS  FOR EXAMPLE  A JUDGE WHO ISSUES A DECISION CANNOT SIMPLY DECIDE WHICH SIDE HE FAVORS AND THEN GENERATE AN OPINION  HE MUST FIRST PASS THROUGH AND NEGOTIATE THE AUTHORIZED ROUTES FOR GETTING THERE  SOMETIMES THE EFFORT AT NEGOTIATION WILL FAIL AND HE WILL SAY THAT DESPITE HIS INTERPRETIVE DESIRES  THIS OPINION JUST WONT WRITE ANY OPINION WILL WRITE IF THERE ARE NO ROUTES TO BE NEGOTIATED OR NO STANDARDS TO HEW TO  IF NOTHING BUT YOUR OWN INTERPRETIVE DESIRE PREVENTS YOU FROM ASSEMBLING OR REASSEMBLING BITS OF UNMOORED DATA LYING AROUND IN THE WORLD INTO A STORY THAT SERVES YOUR PURPOSES  IT IS NOT POSTMODERNISM THAT LICENSES THIS IRRESPONSIBILITY  IT IS THE DOCTRINE THAT FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AND TRANSPARENCY ARE ALL WE NEED THOSE WHO PROCLAIM THIS THEOLOGY CAN IN GOOD FAITH IGNORE OR BYPASS ALL THE USUAL ROUTES OF VALIDATION BECAUSE THEIR RELIGION TELLS THEM THAT THOSE ROUTES ARE CORRUPT AND THAT ONLY THE NONMETHOD OF HAVING NO ROUTES  NO BOUNDARIES  NO CATEGORIES  NO SILOS CAN BRING US TO THE RIVER JORDAN AND BEYOND IN MANY VERSIONS OF PROTESTANTISM  PARISHIONERS ARE URGED TO REJECT MERELY HUMAN AUTHORITY IN ANY FORM AND GO DIRECTLY TO THE PURE WORD OF GOD  FOR THE TECHNOPHILES THE PURE WORD OF GOD IS TO BE FOUND IN DATA  IN FACT  WHAT IS FOUND IN A LANDSCAPE WHERE DATA DETACHED FROM ANY CONTEXT ABOUNDS IS THE FRACTURING OF THE WORD INTO EVER PROLIFERATING PIECES OF DISCOURSE  ALL EXISTING SIDE BY SIDE  INDIFFERENTLY APPROVED  AND WITHOUT ANY WAY OF DISTINGUISHING AMONG THEM  OF TELLING WHICH OF THEM ARE TRUE OR AT LEAST HAVE A CLAIM TO BE TRUE AND WHICH ARE MADE UP OUT OF WHOLE CLOTH THAT IS THE WORLD OF FAKE NEWS  IT IS CREATED BY THE UNDERMINING OF TRUST IN THE TRADITIONAL VEHICLES OF AUTHORITY AND LEGITIMATION  MAJOR NEWSPAPERS  PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS  CREDENTIALED ACADEMICS  STANDARD ENCYCLOPEDIAS  GOVERNMENT BUREAUS  FEDERAL COURTS  PRIME TIME NIGHTLY NEWS ANCHORS WHEN WALTER CRONKITE WAS THE LONGTIME ANCHOR AT CBS  HE WAS KNOWN AS THE MOST TRUSTED MAN IN AMERICA  AND WHEN HE SIGNED OFF BY SAYING  AND THATS THE WAY IT IS  EVERYONE BELIEVED HIM  IN THE BRAVE NEW WORLD OF THE INTERNET  WHERE AUTHORITY IS EVENLY DISTRIBUTED TO EVERYONE WITH A VOICE OR A PODCAST  NO ONE BELIEVES ANYBODY  OR  IT IS THE SAME THING  EVERYONE BELIEVES ANYBODY THIS WHOLESALE DISTRUST OF AUTHORITATIVE MECHANISMS LEADS TO THE BIZARRE CONCLUSION THAT AN ASSERTION OF FACT IS MORE CREDIBLE IF IT LACKS AN INSTITUTIONAL SOURCE  IN THIS WAY OF THINKING  A PIECE OF NEWS ORIGINATING IN A BLOG MAINTAINED BY A TEENAGER IN A BASEMENT IN IDAHO WOULD BE MORE RELIABLE THAN A PIECE OF NEWS ANNOUNCED BY THE ANCHOR OF A MAJOR NETWORK  AND  AGAIN  WHAT HAS BROUGHT US TO THIS SORRY PASS IS NOT THE WRITINGS OF DERRIDA OR FOUCAULT OR ANY POSTMODERN GURU BUT THE TWIN MANTRAS OF MORE FREE SPEECH AND ABSOLUTE TRANSPARENCY

20180503,business,finance,10,WASHINGTON  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP INSISTED THURSDAY HIS REIMBURSEMENT OF A 2016 HUSH PAYMENT TO PORN ACTRESS STORMY DANIELS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN  BUT THE SURPRISE REVELATION OF THE PRESIDENT S PAYMENT CLASHED WITH HIS PAST STATEMENTS  CREATED NEW LEGAL HEADACHES AND STUNNED MANY IN THE WEST WING WHITE HOUSE AIDES WERE BLINDSIDED WHEN TRUMP S RECENTLY ADDED ATTORNEY  RUDY GIULIANI  SAID WEDNESDAY NIGHT THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD REPAID MICHAEL COHEN FOR  000 THAT WAS GIVEN TO DANIELS TO KEEP HER QUIET BEFORE THE 2016 ELECTION ABOUT HER ALLEGATIONS OF AN AFFAIR WITH TRUMP  GIULIANI S REVELATION  WHICH SEEMED TO CONTRADICT TRUMP S PAST STATEMENTS  CAME AS THE PRESIDENT S NEWLY CONFIGURED OUTSIDE LEGAL TEAM PURSUED HIS DEFENSE  APPARENTLY WITH ZERO COORDINATION WITH THE WEST WING WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS SAID SHE FIRST LEARNED THAT TRUMP HAD REPAID THE HUSH MONEY FROM GIULIANI S INTERVIEW ON FOX

SUMMONED TO RETURN FOR A LIVE INTERVIEW WHILE GIULIANI SAID THE PAYMENT TO DANIELS WAS  GOING TO TURN OUT TO BE PERFECTLY LEGAL  LEGAL EXPERTS SAID THE NEW INFORMATION RAISED A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS  INCLUDING WHETHER THE MONEY REPRESENTED REPAYMENT OF AN UNDISCLOSED LOAN OR COULD BE SEEN AS REIMBURSEMENT FOR A CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURE  EITHER COULD BE LEGALLY PROBLEMATIC GIULIANI INSISTED TRUMP DIDN T KNOW THE SPECIFICS OF COHEN S ARRANGEMENT WITH DANIELS UNTIL RECENTLY  TELLING  FOX   FRIENDS  ON THURSDAY THAT THE PRESIDENT DIDN T KNOW ALL THE DETAILS UNTIL  MAYBE 10 DAYS AGO  GIULIANI TOLD THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT TRUMP HAD REPAID COHEN  000 A MONTH  OUT OF HIS PERSONAL FAMILY ACCOUNT  AFTER THE CAMPAIGN WAS OVER  HE SAID COHEN RECEIVED  000 OR  000 IN ALL FOR EXPENSES RELATED TO TRUMP BUT NO DEBT TO COHEN WAS LISTED ON TRUMP S PERSONAL FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORM  WHICH WAS CERTIFIED ON JUNE 16  2017  ASKED IF TRUMP HAD FILED A FRAUDULENT FORM  SANDERS SAID   I DON T KNOW GIULIANI SAID THE PAYMENT WAS NOT A CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATION  BUT ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT DANIELS  HUSHED UP ALLEGATIONS COULD HAVE AFFECTED THE CAMPAIGN  SAYING   IMAGINE IF THAT CAME OUT ON OCTOBER 15  2016  IN

20180503,politics,trump,10,WASHINGTON  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP REIMBURSED HIS PERSONAL LAWYER FOR  000 IN HUSH MONEY PAID TO A PORN ACTRESS DAYS BEFORE THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION  RUDY GIULIANI  ONE OF TRUMP S ATTORNEYS  SAID WEDNESDAY  APPEARING TO CONTRADICT THE PRESIDENT S PAST CLAIMS THAT HE DIDN T KNOW THE SOURCE OF THE MONEY DURING AN APPEARANCE ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL S  HANNITY  GIULIANI SAID THE MONEY TO REPAY MICHAEL COHEN HAD BEEN  FUNNELED   THROUGH THE LAW FIRM AND THE PRESIDENT REPAID IT ASKED IF TRUMP KNEW ABOUT THE ARRANGEMENT  GIULIANI SAID   HE DIDN T KNOW ABOUT THE SPECIFICS OF IT  AS FAR AS I KNOW  BUT HE DID KNOW ABOUT THE GENERAL ARRANGEMENT  THAT MICHAEL WOULD TAKE CARE OF THINGS LIKE THIS  LIKE I TAKE CARE OF THINGS LIKE THIS FOR MY CLIENTS  I DON T BURDEN THEM WITH EVERY SINGLE THING THAT COMES ALONG  THESE ARE BUSY PEOPLE THE COMMENTS APPEARED TO CONTRADICT STATEMENTS MADE BY TRUMP SEVERAL WEEKS AGO  WHEN HE SAID HE DIDN T KNOW ABOUT THE PAYMENT TO PORN ACTRESS STORMY DANIELS AS PART OF A NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT SHE SIGNED DAYS BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION  GIULIANI LATER SUGGESTED TO THE WALL STREET JOURNAL THAT WHILE TRUMP HAD REPAID THE  000  COHEN HAD SETTLED THE PAYMENT TO DANIELS WITHOUT TRUMP S KNOWLEDGE AT THE TIME GUILIANI S REVELATION SEEMED AIMED AT REDUCING THE PRESIDENT S LEGAL EXPOSURE  BUT OUTSIDE EXPERTS SAID IT RAISED A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS  INCLUDING WHETHER THE MONEY REPRESENTED REPAYMENT OF AN UNDISCLOSED LOAN OR COULD BE SEEN AS REIMBURSEMENT FOR A CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURE ASKED ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE LAST MONTH WHETHER HE KNEW ABOUT THE PAYMENT  TRUMP SAID FLATLY   NO  TRUMP ALSO SAID HE DIDN T KNOW WHY COHEN HAD MADE THE PAYMENT OR WHERE HE GOT THE MONEY IN A PHONE INTERVIEW WITH  FOX AND FRIENDS  LAST WEEK  HOWEVER  TRUMP APPEARED TO MUDDY THE WATERS  SAYING THAT COHEN REPRESENTED HIM IN THE  CRAZY STORMY DANIELS DEAL THE WHITE HOUSE REFERRED QUESTIONS TO THE PRESIDENT S PERSONAL LEGAL TEAM GIULIANI  A FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR AND EX U S  ATTORNEY WHO JOINED TRUMP S LEGAL TEAM LAST MONTH  SAID THE PRESIDENT HAD REPAID COHEN OVER SEVERAL MONTHS  INDICATING THE PAYMENTS CONTINUED THROUGH AT LEAST THE PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION  IF NOT INTO HIS PRESIDENCY  HE ALSO SAID THE PAYMENT  IS GOING TO TURN OUT TO BE PERFECTLY LEGAL  BECAUSE  THAT MONEY WAS NOT CAMPAIGN MONEY NO DEBT TO COHEN IS LISTED ON TRUMP S PERSONAL FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORM  WHICH WAS CERTIFIED ON JUNE 16  2017 GIULIANI ALSO DESCRIBED THE PAYMENT TO DANIELS AS  A VERY REGULAR THING FOR LAWYERS TO DO DANIELS  LAWYER  MICHAEL AVENATTI  CALLED THE COMMENT  A STUNNING REVELATION MR  TRUMP EVIDENTLY HAS PARTICIPATED IN A FELONY AND THERE MUST BE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR HIS CONDUCT AND HIS LIES AND DECEPTION TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  HE SAID GIULIANI MADE THE STATEMENTS TO FOX HOST SEAN HANNITY  WHO HAS HIS OWN CONNECTION TO THE CASE  IT WAS RECENTLY REVEALED IN COURT THAT HANNITY IS ONE OF COHEN S CLIENTS  HANNITY HAS DESCRIBED HIS PERSONAL DEALINGS WITH COHEN AS CENTERED ON REAL ESTATE ADVICE AND SAID THAT IT  NEVER ROSE TO ANY LEVEL THAT I NEEDED TO TELL ANYONE THAT I WAS ASKING HIM QUESTIONS DANIELS  WHOSE LEGAL NAME IS STEPHANIE CLIFFORD  SAYS SHE HAD A SEXUAL ENCOUNTER WITH TRUMP IN 2006  MONTHS AFTER HIS THIRD WIFE GAVE BIRTH TO HIS YOUNGEST CHILD  AND WAS PAID TO KEEP QUIET AS PART OF A NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT SHE IS NOW SEEKING TO INVALIDATE  SHE HAS ALSO FILED A DEFAMATION SUIT AGAINST TRUMP AFTER HE QUESTIONED A COMPOSITE SKETCH SHE RELEASED OF A MAN SHE SAYS THREATENED HER TO STAY QUIET THE WHITE HOUSE HAS SAID TRUMP DENIES HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH DANIELS COHEN HAD SAID PREVIOUSLY   NEITHER THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION NOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WAS A PARTY TO THE TRANSACTION WITH MS  CLIFFORD  AND NEITHER REIMBURSED ME FOR THE PAYMENT  EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY  HE NOTABLY DID NOT INCLUDE THE PRESIDENT PERSONALLY ASKED ABOUT COHEN S DENIAL  GIULIANI SAID THAT HE DIDN T KNOW WHETHER COHEN HAD MADE THE PAYMENT WITHOUT ASKING TRUMP BUT THAT HE HAD  NO REASON TO DISPUTE THAT THE REVELATION FROM GIULIANI CAME AS COHEN WAS UNDER ESCALATING LEGAL PRESSURE  HE IS FACING A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION IN NEW YORK  AND FBI AGENTS RAIDED HIS HOME AND OFFICE SEVERAL WEEKS AGO SEEKING RECORDS ABOUT THE NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT DANIELS  LAWSUIT OVER THE HUSH DEAL HAS BEEN DELAYED  WITH THE JUDGE CITING THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION THE PAYMENT TO DANIELS HAS RAISED NUMEROUS LEGAL QUESTIONS  INCLUDING WHETHER IT WAS AN ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION AND  NOW  LOAN IF THIS IS TRUE THEN IT LOOKS LIKE COHEN MAY HAVE MADE AN UNREPORTED LOAN TO THE CAMPAIGN RATHER THAN A CONTRIBUTION  SAID RICHARD L  HASEN  AN EXPERT IN ELECTION LAW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA  IRVINE HE SAID THAT MIGHT BE BETTER FOR COHEN  BUT NOT FOR TRUMP  BECAUSE IT UNDERMINES THE ARGUMENT THAT COHEN WAS ACTING INDEPENDENTLY THE GREATEST SIGNIFICANCE IS THAT IT IMPLICATES THE PRESIDENT DIRECTLY  HE SAID LAW FIRMS ADVANCE EXPENSES FOR CLIENTS AS A MATTER OF COURSE  AND SO THERE S NOTHING INHERENTLY IMPROPER ABOUT A LAWYER COVERING A PARTICULAR PAYMENT AND THEN BEING REIMBURSED FOR IT  IN THIS CASE  THOUGH  THE CLIENT WHO APPARENTLY REIMBURSED THE EXPENSE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND THE MONEY WAS PAID JUST DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION  RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER COHEN S LAW PRACTICE WAS FUNCTIONING AS A VENDOR FOR THE CAMPAIGN AND WHETHER THE EXPENSE WAS THEREFORE AN UNREPORTED CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURE  IF SO  THAT COULD BE LEGALLY PROBLEMATIC ANDREW HERMAN  AN ATTORNEY SPECIALIZING IN CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAW AT MILLER   CHEVALIER  SAID GIULIANI S ARGUMENT THAT THIS WAS A PRIVATE PAYMENT UNRELATED TO THE CAMPAIGN APPEARS TO BE  PRETTY FAR FETCHED  GIVEN THE TIMING  WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION WHILE TRUMP WAS UNDER FIRE FOR HIS BEHAVIOR WITH WOMEN AND FOR AN  ACCESS HOLLYWOOD  TAPE IN WHICH HE SPOKE OF GROPING WOMEN WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT BUT IF COHEN OR TRUMP COULD ESTABLISH THAT DISCUSSIONS WITH DANIELS OVER THE PAYMENT LONG PREDATED HIS RUN FOR OFFICE  THAT COULD HELP THEM WITH THE ARGUMENT THAT THE MONEY WAS A PERSONAL RATHER THAN POLITICAL EXPENSE IT OBVIOUSLY INCREASES THE PRESIDENT S EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATIONS  BUT IT ALSO MAKES HIM LOOK TERRIBLE  SAID SOL WISENBERG  A DEFENSE ATTORNEY WHO WAS A DEPUTY INDEPENDENT COUNSEL DURING THE STARR SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION INTO PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON I DON T UNDERSTAND THE GIULIANI STRATEGY  HE ADDED   MAYBE IT S BEEN TOO LONG SINCE HE S BEEN IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE FIELD ASSOCIATED PRESS

20180507,politics,election,4,PARIS  WHEN EMMANUEL MACRON WAS GEARING UP FOR HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IN 2016  HE SET OUT ON AN UNPRECEDENTED  GREAT MARCH   A DOOR TO DOOR CAMPAIGN TO HEAR VOTERS  GRIEVANCES IN WHAT PROMISED TO BE A NEW  MORE OPEN WAY OF RUNNING THE COUNTRY A YEAR AFTER HIS ELECTION  THINGS HAVE NOT TURNED OUT THAT WAY  AND A SMALL BUT GROWING NUMBER OF RANK AND FILE SUPPORTERS HAS VOICED FRUSTRATION AT A LEADERSHIP STYLE THAT IS  BY MACRON S OWN ADMISSION  NOT ALWAYS INCLUSIVE SURROUNDED BY A SMALL COTERIE OF CLOSE AIDES  MACRON IS PUSHING THROUGH A SERIES OF CONTENTIOUS REFORMS WITH LESS CONSULTATION THAN IS USUAL EVEN FOR FRANCE  WHOSE 1958 CONSTITUTION GIVES THE PRESIDENT WIDE RANGING POWERS THE 40 YEAR OLD  DESCRIBED BY ONE ADVISER AS A HYPERACTIVE WHO NEEDS LITTLE SLEEP  STRONGLY DEFENDS HIS METHODS I MAKE ABSOLUTELY NO APOLOGY FOR THE VERTICALITY OF POWER  HE TOLD LITERARY JOURNAL LA NOUVELLE REVUE FRANAISE I AM PROUD OF THE CHOICES THAT ARE BEING MADE  AND I HATE THE PROCESS WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY EXPLAIN THE REASONING BEHIND A DECISION THAT GRATES WITH THE LIKES OF CORINNE LEPAGE  A FORMER MINISTER UNDER CONSERVATIVE JACQUES CHIRAC WHO WAS ONE OF THE FIRST WELL KNOWN POLITICIANS TO JOIN MACRON S CAMPAIGN IN 2016 INITIALLY WON OVER BY THE EX MINISTER S CHARISMA AND A PROMISE OF DOING POLITICS DIFFERENTLY  SHE SAID MACRON S PROGRAM WAS WRITTEN BEHIND CLOSED DOORS BY THE SAME GROUP OF PEOPLE NOW IN CHARGE AT THE ELYSEE WHAT I QUICKLY FOUND EMBARRASSING IS THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN THE BOTTOM UP APPROACH THAT WAS PROMISED AND SOLD TO THE FRENCH  AND THE REALITY  LEPAGE TOLD REUTERS IT S DEMOCRATIC CENTRALISM  THE SOVIET WAY  COMPLETELY VERTICAL  AND ALSO VERY MASCULINE MANY GRASS ROOT SUPPORTERS  WHO SET UP THOUSANDS OF  EN MARCHE  COMMITTEES ACROSS FRANCE DURING MACRON S CAMPAIGN  GAVE UP WHEN THEY REALIZED THEIR IDEAS DID NOT FILTER THROUGH TO PARIS  SHE SAID WHILE THERE IS NO SIGN OF MACRON CHANGING TACK  HIS POPULARITY RATINGS HAVE SLIPPED TO THEIR LOWEST POINT SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE  WITH ONLY 40 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION HAVING A FAVORABLE OPINION OF HIM  ACCORDING TO A RECENT POLL AMONG THE REASONS FOR WEAKENING SUPPORT IS PEOPLE S PERCEPTION OF AN ARROGANT PRESIDENT WORRIED ABOUT LOOKING AFTER THE WEALTHY WE CAN REFORM DESPITE BEING FRANCE S YOUNGEST ELECTED LEADER  MACRON HAS SHOWN A SURE FOOTED CONFIDENCE IN OFFICE SO FAR  BACKED BY A TIGHT GROUP OF LIKE MINDED ADMINISTRATORS   MOST OF THEM MEN AND DUBBED THE  MACRON BOYS  ALTHOUGH THERE ARE WOMEN TOO OVERSEEN BY ALEXIS KOHLER   WHO LIKE MACRON IS AN ALUMNUS OF THE ELITE ADMINISTRATIVE SCHOOL ENA AND WORKED IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR   THE CORE GROUP OF AROUND A DOZEN MEMBERS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DRIVING THE REFORM PROGRAM IT HAS DONE SO AT BREAKNECK SPEED IN JUST A YEAR  MACRON HAS MADE HIRING AND FIRING EASIER  SLASHED A WEALTH TAX  LAUNCHED AN OVERHAUL OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM  UNVEILED PLANS TO CUT THE NUMBER OF LAWMAKERS AND CONFRONTED UNIONS WITH A REFORM OF THE DEBT LADEN RAILWAYS MORE IS IN THE PIPELINE IT S STARTED LIKE A SPRINT BUT WILL SOON TURN INTO A MARATHON  KOHLER  45  TOLD REUTERS IN HIS GILDED OFFICE  ONE ROOM AWAY FROM THE PRESIDENT S WE RE MAKING PLANS RATHER FAR INTO 2018  EVEN BEYOND THAT  WE RE WORKING ON THE BASIS THAT WE LL HAVE THE CAPACITY TO REFORM  HE SAID THAT CONFIDENCE   IN A COUNTRY WHERE GOVERNMENTS HAVE LONG BEEN FORCED TO WATER DOWN OR SCRAP REFORMS IN THE FACE OF POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND PROTESTS   COMES FROM A CENTRALIZATION OF POWER THAT IS DOWN AS MUCH TO MEN AS INSTITUTIONS MACRON  WHO WROTE HIS UNDERGRADUATE PHILOSOPHY DISSERTATION ON RENAISSANCE ITALIAN DIPLOMAT MACHIAVELLI FAMED FOR HIS CHILLING GUIDE TO HOLDING POWER  HAS ENSURED COMPETING VOICES DO NOT EASILY EMERGE HE HAS CAPPED THE NUMBER OF ADVISERS MINISTERS CAN HAVE TO 10  REDUCING THEIR AUTONOMY  WHEN MACRON WAS ECONOMY MINISTER  HE HAD 25 ADVISERS MINISTERS ALSO ALLOW THEIR PRESS INTERVIEWS TO BE PROOF READ BY THE ELYSEE   SOMETIMES BY MACRON HIMSELF MANY MEMBERS OF THE CABINET ARE TECHNOCRATS STILL WIDELY UNKNOWN TO THE PUBLIC  THE PRIME MINISTER  A FORMER CONSERVATIVE MAYOR  HAS HAD TO SHARE ADVISERS   OFTEN MACRON LOYALISTS   WITH THE PRESIDENT STREAMLINED DECISION MAKING GOES HAND IN HAND WITH TIGHT CONTROL OF THE MESSAGE  AS AN OCCURRENCE AT THE ELYSEE PALACE IN MAY LAST YEAR UNDERLINED KOHLER  MACRON S MOST TRUSTED ADVISER  WANTED TO ENSURE THAT FRENCH COMPANY ALSTOM WAS NOT SIDELINED BY A PROPOSED PLAN BY GERMAN INDUSTRIAL GIANT SIEMENS TO MERGE PART OF ITS OPERATIONS WITH CANADIAN RIVAL BOMBARDIER ANY SUCH MERGER COULD HAVE LEFT ALSTOM  THE MAKER OF TGV HIGH SPEED TRAINS  ISOLATED AND WEAKENED I NEED THREE MONTHS WITHOUT ANY LEAKS  KOHLER TOLD THE PRESIDENT S PRESS ADVISER  ACCORDING TO A PERSON PRESENT UNUSUALLY FOR SUCH HIGH STAKES CROSS BORDER DEALS  NOTHING LEAKED UNTIL THE DAY A SIEMENS ALSTOM MERGER WAS ANNOUNCED BY THE TWO COMPANIES FOUR MONTHS LATER PERHAPS SURPRISINGLY FOR A PRESIDENT HAILED AS A SAVIOR OF PROGRESSIVE VALUES IN EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE  MACRON S OFFICE ALSO ANNOUNCED IT WOULD MOVE THE PRESS ROOM   A SYMBOL OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY   OUT OF THE ELYSEE MACRON S  SPECIAL ADVISER  ISMAEL EMELIEN HAS DEVELOPED A COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY USING TWITTER AND FACEBOOK LIVE TO CUT OUT THE MEDIA AND PRODUCE SLICK SNIPPETS OF PRESIDENTIAL LIFE LURCH TO THE RIGHT SHORTLY AFTER HIS ELECTION  MACRON WAS GIVEN A HUGE PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY THANKS TO AN ELECTORAL SYSTEM SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED BY POST WAR LEADER CHARLES DE GAULLE TO MAXIMIZE PRESIDENTIAL INDEPENDENCE FROM PARLIAMENT HIS LAWMAKERS  MANY OF THEM NEWCOMERS TO POLITICS  HAVE DILIGENTLY PASSED REFORMS SENT THEIR WAY  OFTEN VIA LEGAL DECREES MEANT TO SPEED UP DEBATE FOR INVESTORS  THE ABILITY TO DELIVER A MODERNIZING PROGRAM IS POSITIVE FOR THE FRENCH ECONOMY AND WIDER EURO ZONE BUT MACRON S CONTROLLING STYLE IS NOT WITHOUT RISK RIVALS AND A HANDFUL OF ALLIES WARN THAT THE ELECTORATE COULD TURN TO POPULIST PARTIES IN 2022 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IF THEY FEEL THEIR VOICES ARE NOT BEING HEARD BY THE PRESIDENCY ALTHOUGH MACRON S MAJORITY REMAINS SOLID  SOME SUPPORTERS  MOSTLY HAILING FROM THE LEFT  FEEL HE HAS LURCHED TO THE RIGHT AND BYPASSED PARLIAMENT A PARTICULARLY DIVISIVE IMMIGRATION BILL  WHICH CRITICS SAID WAS TOO TOUGH AND JARRED WITH MACRON S PRO REFUGEE STANCE DURING CAMPAIGNING  SHOWED ONE OF THE FIRST CRACKS IN HIS SUPPORT ONE MACRON LAWMAKER VOTED AGAINST IT AND 14 ABSTAINED THE DEFECTOR  FORMER SOCIALIST JEAN MICHEL CLEMENT  SAID THERE WAS A RISK THAT FRANCE WAS DRIFTING TOWARD A SITUATION WHERE  PARLIAMENTARY CONTROL IS NON EXISTENT WHY WAS I THE ONLY ONE TO VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL WHEN EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WAS A BAD ONE  BECAUSE THEY RE NOT ANSWERING THE QUESTION  HE TOLD REUTERS DOES THAT MEAN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS A STRANGLEHOLD ON THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH  I THINK IT DOES  HE SAID AND A DRAFT CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM TO CUT THE NUMBER OF LAWMAKERS WILL TIP THE BALANCE OF POWER EVEN MORE TOWARD THE PRESIDENT AND THE GOVERNMENT AND WEAKEN PARLIAMENT  HE ADDED THE STAKES ARE HIGH  IF VOTERS CONCLUDE THAT MACRON IS MERELY THE LATEST IN A LINE OF MAINSTREAM POLITICIANS THAT HAVE LET THEM DOWN  THAT COULD BENEFIT MORE EXTREMIST FORCES THE MOST DISAPPOINTED ONES WON T GIVE THEIR VOTE TO THE PRESIDENT TWICE  WHEN YOU HAVE MARINE LE PEN AT 21 PERCENT AND JEAN LUC MELENCHON AT 20 PERCENT  ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN TOMORROW  SAID CLEMENT LE PEN LEADS THE FAR RIGHT FRONT NATIONAL PARTY AND MELENCHON REPRESENTS THE FAR

20180506,sports,basketball,1,PHILADELPHIA  BRAD STEVENS  THE COACH OF THE BOSTON CELTICS  KNOWS A FEW THINGS ABOUT BASKETBALL  AT LEAST ONE OF HIS PLAYERS REFERS TO HIM AS A GURU  AND ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER THE PREMATURE CONFETTI HAD BEEN CLEARED FROM THE COURT AT WELLS FARGO CENTER ON SATURDAY NIGHT  STEVENS CASUALLY MENTIONED THAT HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE 40 ODD PLAYS THAT THE PHILADELPHIA 76ERS RUN DURING END OF GAME SITUATIONS AFTER TIMEOUTS I MEAN  WEVE WATCHED THEM ALL  STEVENS SAID  SOMEHOW DELIVERING THIS INFORMATION WITHOUT A TRACE OF CONCEIT BUT EVEN STEVENS NEEDS HELP  ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE INJURIES THAT HAVE LEFT MOTH HOLES IN HIS ROSTER THIS SEASON  AND HE KNOWS WHERE TO FIND IT  AL HORFORD  A POWER FORWARD IN HIS 11TH SEASON WHO HAS EMERGED AS A UNIQUELY STABILIZING FORCE FOR THE CELTICS IN THESE N B A  PLAYOFFS WHEN THINGS GET GOING POORLY  EVERYBODY JUST KIND OF LOOKS AT AL  INCLUDING THE COACHES  STEVENS SAID  WE ALL KIND OF STARE AT AL AND WAIT FOR HIM TO SAY SOMETHING  AND THEN WHEN HE DOES SAY SOMETHING  WE ALL FEEL BETTER AND TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND MAYBE WE CAN GO INTO OVERTIME AND WIN THIS THING  HES UNBELIEVABLE THE CELTICS ARE RIDING THE RAPID RISES OF YOUNG PLAYERS LIKE JAYSON TATUM  JAYLEN BROWN AND TERRY ROZIER  WHO ARE NOT BEHAVING LIKE YOUNG PLAYERS  BUT IT IS WORTH EMPHASIZING AD NAUSEAM  THESE ARE THE SAME CELTICS WHO LOST GORDON HAYWARD TO A GRUESOME ANKLE INJURY ON THE FIRST NIGHT OF THE SEASON AND KYRIE IRVING TO KNEE SURGERY LAST MONTH NOW  FOLLOWING THEIR 101 98 OVERTIME VICTORY ON SATURDAY  THE CELTICS ARE ONE WIN FROM SWEEPING THE 76ERS IN THEIR EASTERN CONFERENCE SEMIFINAL SERIES  GAME 4 IS MONDAY NIGHT IN PHILADELPHIA  A CITY WHERE CONFETTI HAS BECOME A FOUR LETTER WORD AND WHERE THE CELTICS COULD CLINCH A SECOND STRAIGHT BERTH IN THE CONFERENCE FINALS WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT OF US  HORFORD SAID HE MAY NEVER WIN PRIZES FOR FIERY ORATORY  HORFORD  31  TENDS TO BE IMPASSIVE WITH HIS POSTGAME REMARKS  BUT HIS STEADY DEMEANOR IS PART OF WHAT MAKES HIM INVALUABLE TO THE CELTICS  NOT MUCH BOTHERS HIM  LEAST OF ALL THE UNFAIR REPUTATION THAT HE VANISHES IN BIG MOMENTS  HE IS NOT LEBRON JAMES  WHO IS  BUT HORFORD  OPERATING WITH THE WISDOM ACCUMULATED OVER 10 TRIPS TO THE POSTSEASON  HAS HIS FINGERPRINTS ALL OVER THIS SERIES HES ALWAYS MAKING SURE WERE IN THE RIGHT SITUATIONS  SAID TATUM  A FIRST YEAR FORWARD WHO IS AVERAGING 18 1 POINTS A GAME IN THE PLAYOFFS  ITS TOUGH DOWN THERE  BUT HE WAS TOUGHER HERE IS AN ABRIDGED LIST OF THE WAYS IN WHICH HORFORD AFFECTED GAME 3  HE TOOK TURNS DEFENDING THE 76ERS STARTING POINT GUARD  BEN SIMMONS  AND THEIR STARTING CENTER  JOEL EMBIID  FEW PLAYERS HAVE THAT SORT OF VERSATILITY  AND IT IS NO COINCIDENCE THAT SIMMONS AND EMBIID ARE STRUGGLING  ALSO WORTH NOTING  HORFORD MANAGED TO GO ALL OF GAME 3 WITHOUT A FOUL  A TIGHTROPE WALK THAT EMBIID  FOR ONE  THOUGHT WAS BALONEY I DONT SEE HOW ITS POSSIBLE FOR SOMEONE TO GUARD ME AND HAVE ZERO FOULS  SAID EMBIID  WHO SHOT 10 OF 26 FROM THE FIELD  A COUPLE OF PLAYS  IT WASNT FAIR  BUT YOU HAVE TO GIVE AL A LOT OF CREDIT  HE COMPETED FOR HIS TEAM AND GOT THEM THE WIN  IM TOO BIG  BUT I GUESS ITS THE PLAYOFFS  IM LEARNING  BUT I AM TOO BIG TO NOT BE FOULED WHEN I GO TO THE BASKET THAT SORT OF ATTITUDE DOES NOT BODE WELL FOR THE 76ERS MOVING FORWARD  HORFORD URGED HIS TEAMMATES TO KEEP THEIR COMPOSURE AS ARENA WORKERS SCRAMBLED TO CLEAR THE COURT OF CONFETTI AT THE END OF REGULATION  OH  RIGHT  THE CONFETTI  IT CAME POURING OUT OF A COURTSIDE CANNON AFTER THE 76ERS MARCO BELINELLI MADE A LONG BUZZER BEATER AT THE END OF REGULATION  THE PROBLEM WAS THAT IT WAS A 2 POINTER  NOT A 3 POINTER  AND ONLY TIED THE GAME  WHOOPS I DIDNT CARE ABOUT THE CONFETTI  SAID HORFORD  ADDING  I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS AT STAKE  HORFORD TRUSTED HIS COACH IN AN IMPORTANT SITUATION  THE CELTICS WERE TRAILING BY 1 WITH LESS THAN 10 SECONDS LEFT WHEN STEVENS MOTIONED FOR A TIMEOUT  JUST AS HORFORD WAS ABOUT TO RECEIVE AN ENTRY PASS IN THE POST AGAINST THE 76ERS ERSAN ILYASOVA  STEVEN WANTED TO CONCOCT AN OUT OF BOUNDS PLAY THAT HE THOUGHT WOULD BE MORE FAVORABLE FOR HIS TEAM HE SEES CERTAIN THINGS AND UNDERSTANDS THEM  HORFORD SAID  IT JUST SEEMS LIKE HE MAKES THE RIGHT DECISION EVERY TIME SURE ENOUGH  THE CELTICS CLEARED SPACE FOR HORFORD ON THE INBOUNDS  WHO TOOK A LOB OVER THE TOP OF THE 76ERS ROBERT COVINGTON AND SCORED ON A LAYUP TO GIVE THE CELTICS THE LEAD FOR GOOD  FINALLY  HORFORD MADE THE GAMES MOST CRUCIAL DEFENSIVE PLAY WHEN HE STOLE THE 76ERS ENSUING INBOUNDS PASS AND WAS FOULED  HE MADE BOTH FREE THROWS  SEALING THE WIN AL JUST MADE A HECK OF A PLAY  STEVENS SAID EVEN AS 76ERS COACH BRETT BROWN CONTINUES TO EXPRESS HOPE THAT HIS PLAYERS ARE LEARNING FROM THESE PLAYOFFS  HE WAS CAREFUL AFTER THE GAME TO AVOID BLAMING HIS TEAMS INEXPERIENCE FOR THEIR VARIOUS LATE STAGE CATASTROPHES  AND PERHAPS FOR GOOD REASON  THE CELTICS HAVE LOADS OF YOUNG PLAYERS  TOO BUT IT WAS HORFORDS SAVVY THAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE  AS TATUM PUT IT  HES BEEN IN EVERY SITUATION POSSIBLE

20180502,sports,basketball,2,HOW DO NEW YORK TIMES JOURNALISTS USE TECHNOLOGY IN THEIR JOBS AND IN THEIR PERSONAL LIVES  JOSH HANER  A PHOTOGRAPHER FOR THE TIMES  DISCUSSED THE TECH HES USING WHAT ARE SOME OF THE NEW AND INTERESTING TOOLS YOU ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH FOR VISUAL STORYTELLING IM CONSTANTLY EXPERIMENTING WITH THE LATEST DRONES AND 360 VIRTUAL REALITY CAMERA SYSTEMS  EVERY YEAR  DRONES GET SMALLER AND THEIR CAMERAS GET MORE ADVANCED  IN ADDITION TO IMPROVEMENTS IN IMAGE QUALITY  IM PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN USING DRONES FOR ACTUAL REPORTING  FROM COUNTING HOUSES THAT WERE DAMAGED IN A FIRE  TO TRACKING PLANT HEALTH OVER TIME TO HELP IDENTIFY THE IMPACT OF DROUGHT  TO ANALYZING MIGRATION PATTERNS AND TO IDENTIFYING WHERE PEAT FIRES BURN UNDERGROUND WE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE ON A PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY THAT I FIRST DEVELOPED IN 2010 CALLED OUR REMOTE STREAMING BACKPACK  IT ENABLES OUR PHOTOGRAPHERS TO SEND IN THEIR PICTURES IN REAL TIME OVER MULTIPLE CELLULAR MODEMS WITHOUT HAVING TO STOP  OPEN UP A LAPTOP  EDIT AND SEND  THIS ALLOWS US TO PUBLISH PHOTOS WITHIN SECONDS OF WHEN THEY WERE TAKEN THE FIRST VERSION THAT I BUILT LOOKED LIKE A CRUDE HOME INVENTION  WITH ELECTRONICS MOUNTED TO A PIECE OF PLYWOOD THAT BARELY FIT INTO A BIG CAMERA BACKPACK  NOW THE SYSTEM FITS IN A FANNY PACK AND LOOKS MUCH LESS HOMEMADE THE NEXT IMPROVEMENT WILL BE ADAPTING IT TO OPERATE ON THE 5G CELLULAR NETWORKS BEING BUILT IN THE UNITED STATES  FASTER MOBILE BANDWIDTH WILL ALLOW US TO GET RICHER CONTENT FROM OUR JOURNALISTS FASTER AND WILL HOPEFULLY ALLOW US TO DEPLOY THIS TECHNOLOGY MORE WIDELY FOR BREAKING NEWS EVENTS WHAT ARE THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS YOUVE CAPTURED WITH DRONES THAT YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE WITH OLD FASHIONED PHOTOGRAPHY DRONES HAVE DEMOCRATIZED AERIAL IMAGERY  AS IT NO LONGER COSTS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO RENT A HELICOPTER OR A PLANE TO MAKE IMAGES FROM ABOVE  IM ABLE TO TAKE A DRONE ALONG WITH ME TO ASSIGNMENTS IN REMOTE LOCATIONS THE FIRST DRONE IMAGES I MADE WERE ON A TRIP TO GREENLANDS ICE SHEET  WHERE I CAPTURED IMAGES OF A MELTWATER RIVER FLOWING ACROSS THE TOP OF THE ICE  IN LLAPALLAPANI  BOLIVIA  I USED A DRONE TO SHOW THAT THE SECOND LARGEST LAKE IN BOLIVIA HAD DRIED UP  LEAVING BOATS STRANDED IN THE SAND AND A FISHING COMMUNITY HAVING TO REINVENT ITSELF  MORE RECENTLY  I WAS ABLE TO GET AN AERIAL ANGLE OF THE GIANT MOAI STATUES ON EASTER ISLAND SHOWING THEIR PROXIMITY TO AN ERODING COASTLINE  WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE ANY OTHER WAY WHAT ARE THE MAIN CONCERNS ABOUT USING DRONES THE MAIN CONCERN WITH DRONES IS SAFETY  ITS IMPERATIVE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE LAWS IN THEIR COUNTRY AND IN ANY COUNTRY WHERE THEY ARE CONSIDERING USING A DRONE  THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF MY JOB  APPLYING FOR PERMISSION FROM INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTS TO SAFELY USE A DRONE IN THEIR AIRSPACE BEYOND THE OFFICIAL LEGAL APPROVAL  WHICH VARIES FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY  MANY TIMES IM BRINGING A DRONE INTO A SMALL COMMUNITY AND I WANT TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL ETHICAL CONCERNS  FOR EXAMPLE  IN BOLIVIA  OUR JOURNALISTS MADE MULTIPLE TRIPS TO A REMOTE VILLAGE TO FAMILIARIZE THE COMMUNITY WITH THE IDEA OF WHAT A DRONE IS  AND TO GET PERMISSION FROM THE VILLAGE LEADERS BEFORE BRINGING THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY INTO THEIR COMMUNITY THERE WILL ALWAYS BE PEOPLE WHO ABUSE NEW TECHNOLOGIES  BUT I BELIEVE THAT  AS A COMMUNITY  JOURNALISTS ARE DOING A GOOD JOB SELF REGULATING  THERE ARE SOCIAL MEDIA GROUPS WHERE WE DISCUSS ISSUES AND BRING ATTENTION TO GOOD USES OF THE TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS POTENTIAL CONCERNS  PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE NATIONAL PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS ASSOCIATION AND THE POYNTER INSTITUTE HAVE ALSO COME UP WITH AN EXCELLENT DRONE JOURNALISM CODE OF ETHICS DRONES MAY SEEM LIKE TOYS  BUT IF THEY ARE USED WITHOUT PROPER TRAINING AND SAFEGUARDS  THEY CAN VERY EASILY TURN INTO A THREAT TO AIR SAFETY IN ADDITION TO SAFETY  PEOPLES EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY IS SOMETHING WE MUST CONSIDER  IT IS BEST TO TALK WITH ANYONE WHOSE PRIVACY YOU HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF VIOLATING  BEFORE YOU FLY AND TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE COMFORTABLE DOING WITH YOUR CAMERA ON THE GROUND AND EXTENDING THAT INTO THE SKY  JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN PEER INTO SOMEONES BACKYARD DOESNT MEAN YOU SHOULD OUTSIDE WORK  WHAT TECH PRODUCT ARE YOU CURRENTLY OBSESSED WITH  MY WIFE AND I RECENTLY PURCHASED THE FRAME TV FROM SAMSUNG  WHEN I FIRST SAW IT  I WAS FOOLED INTO THINKING IT WAS A FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH SURROUNDED BY A MAT WE NOW HAVE IT MOUNTED FLUSH ON OUR WALL  PART OF A GALLERY WALL IN OUR LIVING ROOM ALONGSIDE ART THAT WEVE COLLECTED OVER THE YEARS  WHEN ITS NOT IN USE  IT BLENDS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT  THEN THERES THE WOW MOMENT WHEN OUR FRIENDS ASK WHERE THE TV IS AND WE TURN IT ON  AND MAGICALLY A FRAMED PHOTO TURNS INTO A LIVE WARRIORS BASKETBALL GAME OUR HOME AND OUR SPACE ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO US  AND THIS HAS ALLOWED US TO NEVER FEEL LIKE THE TV IS THE CENTER OF ATTENTION I ALSO LOVE BACKPACKING  SOMETIMES ALONE AND OFTEN TO REMOTE AREAS THAT IN THE PAST WOULD MAKE MY FAMILY WORRIED  NOW  WHEN I GET TO CAMP  I PRESS A BUTTON ON THE DELORME INREACH EXPLORER SATELLITE MESSENGER TO TELL MY WIFE AND FAMILY THAT IM O K  IN ADDITION  I CAN REQUEST THE WEATHER FORECAST FOR MY LOCATION  WHEN IM 20 MILES INTO THE BACKCOUNTRY AND IT BEGINS SNOWING  IT IS INVALUABLE TO BE ABLE TO FIND OUT IF THE WEATHER IS GOING TO IMPROVE OR IF I NEED TO LEAVE SO I CAN GET HOME SAFELY BEFORE THEY CLOSE THE ROADS  ITS AN ADDED SAFETY NET THAT LETS ME BE MORE SPONTANEOUS WHEN EXPLORING TECHNOLOGISTS PREDICT THAT TEXT BASED STORYTELLING WILL SOON BE PASS  AND THAT VIDEOS AND PHOTOS WILL BE MORE IMPORTANT IN JOURNALISM  WHAT DO YOU THINK AS A SOCIETY  WE ARE MORE VISUALLY LITERATE THAN EVER BEFORE WITH THE OMNIPRESENCE OF CELLPHONE CAMERAS AND SOCIAL MEDIA  EVERYONE IS A PHOTOGRAPHER  AND EVERYONE IS DOCUMENTING HIS OR HER LIFE IN A WAY UNLIKE EVER BEFORE  IN ADDITION  INSTAGRAM AND SNAPCHAT HAVE MADE US EXPECT AN ACCELERATED PUBLISHING SPEED AND A DEPRIORITIZATION OF TEXT HOWEVER  JUST BECAUSE WE ARE MOVING TOWARD A MORE VISUAL LEXICON DOESNT MEAN THAT ALL IMAGERY IS CREATED EQUALLY  THE RIGHT WAY TO SUCCEED IN JOURNALISM IS NOT FOR SOMETHING TO BE MORE VISUAL  ITS THE QUALITY OF THE VISUALS THAT MATTERS  SINCE OUR AUDIENCE IS BOMBARDED WITH IMAGERY THROUGH ADVERTISING  SOCIAL MEDIA  TEXTING  EMOJI  VIRTUAL REALITY AND ARTIFICIAL REALITY  THERE WILL BE A LOT OF BAD JOURNALISM PRODUCED IN THE NAME OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES AS PUBLISHERS MAKE BETS ON CATERING TO A MORE VISUAL AUDIENCE  THE JOURNALIST BEHIND THE CAMERA IS STILL THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS DISCUSSION  HIS OR HER EYE IS WHAT WILL MAKE OR BREAK THESE VISUALLY DRIVEN PROJECTS WE STILL MUST FIND SMART WAYS TO PUSH VISUAL JOURNALISM FURTHER AND TO MAKE SURE OUR READERS KNOW THE INTEGRITY AND ETHICS BEHIND THE CREATION OF OUR PHOTOGRAPHS  STRONG VISUAL CONTENT DOESNT HAVE TO COME AT THE EXPENSE OF PROSE  AND I THINK THAT SOME OF OUR BEST STORIES AT THE TIMES ARE COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN WRITERS AND VISUAL JOURNALISTS  THAT SAID  I DO THINK THAT MANY PHOTOGRAPHERS AND VIDEO JOURNALISTS ARE NOW TAKING ON A GREATER OWNERSHIP OF OUR STORYTELLING THAN EVER BEFORE

PROTESTERS RATCHET UP THEIR EFFORTS TO FORCE THE RULING ELITE TO LOOSEN ITS GRIP ON THE COUNTRY IN AN EXTRAORDINARY SESSION OF PARLIAMENT  THE OPPOSITION LEADER  NIKOL PASHINYAN  URGED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY  WHICH HAS THE MOST LAWMAKERS  TO INSTALL HIM AS PRIME MINISTER  WARNING THAT IF THEY DID NOT  THEY WOULD FACE A POLITICAL TSUNAMI ON THE STREETS WHEN ALL BUT ONE MEMBER OF THE PARTY VOTED AGAINST HIM ANYWAY  MR  PASHINYAN CALLED FOR A NATIONAL STRIKE STARTING WEDNESDAY TO PARALYZE ROADS  RAILROADS  AIRPORTS  SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC SERVICES IN THE ARMENIAN REPUBLIC THERE IS NO POWER THAT CAN STAND AGAINST YOU  HE TOLD A CHEERING CROWD OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS GATHERED ON REPUBLIC SQUARE IN CENTRAL YEREVAN  THE CAPITAL  WHERE MANY HAD SPENT MORE THAN EIGHT HOURS WATCHING LIVE BROADCASTS OF THE SPEECHES IN PARLIAMENT DESPITE THE PEACEFUL NATURE OF THE PROTESTS THUS FAR  THE STANDOFF COULD FURTHER DESTABILIZE ARMENIA  FEEDING FEARS THAT NEIGHBORING AZERBAIJAN MIGHT EXPLOIT THE CRISIS TO REKINDLE A DECADES LONG WAR OVER THE ETHNICALLY DIVIDED ENCLAVE OF NAGORNO KARABAKH RUSSIA  WHICH MAINTAINS A MILITARY BASE IN ARMENIA  HAS KEPT ITS DISTANCE FROM THE CRISIS  STATING REPEATEDLY THAT IT IS AN INTERNAL MATTER AND URGING ALL SIDES TO SETTLE THEIR DIFFERENCES LEGALLY STILL  ARMENIA  A MINIATURE COUNTRY OF SOME 2 8 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE SOUTHERN CAUCASUS  WAS MOVING INTO UNCHARTED TERRITORY THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED  SAID EMIL SANAMYAN  AN ANALYST WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIAS INSTITUTE OF ARMENIAN STUDIES  THE DEFEAT TAKES MR  PASHINYAN  WHO HAD BEEN

DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE PAST TWO WEEKS  WHICH HAD ALREADY FORCED THE RESIGNATION OF SERZH SARGSYAN  THE MAN WHO HAD LED ARMENIA SINCE 2008  INTO A VOTE TO MAKE THE OPPOSITION FIGURE THE COUNTRYS NEXT LEADER HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CITIZENS OF ARMENIA ARE STANDING ON STREETS AND SQUARES WITH ONE QUESTION  MR  PASHINYAN TOLD THE EXTRAORDINARY PARLIAMENT SESSION  WHICH WAS STREAMED LIVE BY CIVILNET AM  IS THE PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA A BODY THAT WILL SOLVE THE CRISIS  OR IS IT A BODY THAT WILL DEEPEN THE CRISIS THE PARLIAMENT VOTED 56 TO 45 AGAINST MR  PASHINYAN  WITH ONLY ONE MEMBER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SUPPORTING HIM  HE NEEDED A SIMPLE MAJORITY OF THE 105 MEMBER BODY TO WIN  A SECOND SUCH VOTE WILL BE HELD IN A WEEK  ON MAY 8  AND IF HE AGAIN FAILS TO GAIN A MAJORITY  THE COUNTRY MUST HOLD SNAP ELECTIONS 30 TO 45 DAYS LATER THROUGHOUT THE DAY  MEMBERS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ATTACKED MR  PASHINYAN  A 42 YEAR OLD FORMER JOURNALIST AND FATHER OF FOUR  ON PERSONAL

PARLIAMENTARY BACKBENCHES THAN THE PRIME MINISTERS OFFICE ARMAN SAGHETELYAN  A FORMER PRESS SECRETARY FOR MR  SARGSYAN  SAID THAT HE AND FELLOW MILITARY VETERANS THOUGHT THAT BEING COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES REQUIRED MORE THAN A HUNTING T SHIRT THAT COSTS 4 99 EUROS   THE OPPOSITION LEADER HAD TRADED HIS T SHIRT FOR A DARK SUIT AND TIE FOR THE VOTE OTHER LAWMAKERS FOUND THE VERY IDEA OF TRYING TO USE THE STREET PROTESTS TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER GALLING  THIS IS COMPLETELY ABNORMAL  SAID KARINE ATSHEMYAN  WHO IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY  IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED THAT THE POLITICAL MINORITY IN ANY COUNTRY WOULD DICTATE TO THE PARLIAMENT  TO THE POLITICAL MAJORITY MR  PASHINYAN  WHO BELONGS TO A SMALL OPPOSITION ALLIANCE IN PARLIAMENT CALLED YELQ  WHICH TRANSLATES AS WAY OUT  GAVE TWO SPEECHES AND ANSWERED QUESTIONS FOR ABOUT FOUR HOURS  REPEATEDLY EMPHASIZING THAT THE DEMAND FOR CHANGE IN ARMENIA WOULD MOVE FORWARD WHETHER THE REPUBLICANS ACCEPTED IT OR NOT HE AND HIS ALLIES ALSO VOWED TO BREAK UP THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC MONOPOLIES THAT HAVE CONTROLLED THE COUNTRY FOR YEARS THAT IS LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THREAT THAT TIPPED THE VOTE AGAINST HIM  SAID MR  SANAMYAN  THE ANALYST  AS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS STRONG TIES TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY  AND LAWMAKERS PROBABLY WANT TO NEGOTIATE SOME FORM OF GUARANTEES BEFORE CONSIDERING HIM AS A CANDIDATE FOR PRIME MINISTER MEMBERS REPEATEDLY SAID THAT THEY WANTED MORE TIME TO NEGOTIATE WITH MR  PASHINYAN THE PARTY DID NOT PUT FORWARD KAREN KARAPETYAN  THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER AND A SARGSYAN ALLY  AS A CANDIDATE MR  PASHINYAN WAS THE ONLY NOMINEE  BUT ANYONE WHO GARNERS SUPPORT FROM ONE THIRD OF THE MEMBERS CAN STAND NEXT WEEK MR  PASHINYAN HAS SAID THAT THE MAIN TASK OF ANY INTERIM GOVERNMENT IS ORGANIZING THE NEXT PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS  IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE REPUBLICANS  MARKEDLY LESS POPULAR WITH THE PUBLIC  WANTED TO GIVE UP THEIR INFLUENCE OVER THE PROCESS THE VOTE IN PARLIAMENT ON TUESDAY CAME AFTER LARGE SCALE DEMONSTRATIONS ACROSS ARMENIA  LED BY MR  PASHINYAN  ROILED THE GOVERNMENT AND FORCED MR  SARGSYAN TO STEP DOWN THE PROTESTS ERUPTED AFTER MR

100 000 DEMONSTRATORS GATHERING AT TIMES IN CENTRAL YEREVAN  PUSHED HIM TO RESIGN 10 DAYS LATER  IN A BRIEF STATEMENT  HE SAID HE HAD MADE A MISTAKE AND WOULD LISTEN TO THE DEMANDS FROM THE STREET MR  PASHINYANS DEMAND TO TAKE OVER IS APPEALING  ESPECIALLY AMONG YOUNG ARMENIANS  WHO JOINED THE PROTESTS IN DROVES  ANGRY THAT THE SAME SMALL CLUB OF POLITICIANS AND OLIGARCHS HAS CONTROLLED THE COUNTRY SINCE INDEPENDENCE FROM THE SOVIET UNION IN 1991  ARMENIA HAS REMAINED A PARTNER TO RUSSIA  HOWEVER ON TUESDAY  CRITICS REPEATEDLY MENTIONED MR  PASHINYANS PREVIOUS OPPOSITION TO ARMENIAS DECISION TO JOIN THE EURASIAN ECONOMIC UNION  A KREMLIN PROJECT  AND TRIED TO LINK HIM TO VARIOUS KREMLIN CRITICS LIKE MIKHEIL SAAKASHVILI  THE EXILED FORMER PRESIDENT OF NEIGHBORING GEORGIA MR  PASHINYAN HAS SOUGHT TO ASSURE RUSSIA  WHICH INTERVENED MILITARILY IN UKRAINE AND GEORGIA AFTER SIMILAR POPULAR REVOLTS  THAT ARMENIA WOULD REMAIN AN IMPORTANT ALLY

POSITION ON A LOOSER FUTURE CUSTOMS ARRANGEMENT WITH THE EU WHY IS THE ISSUE SO DIVISIVE THE ISSUELIES AT THE HEART OF THE BREXIT DEBATE  SETTING THOSE WHO ARGUE THAT PRAGMATISM ANDBUSINESS INTERESTS SHOULD SHAPE GOVERNMENT POLICY AGAINST THOSE WHO PRIORITIZE SOVEREIGNTY ANDTHE IDEA OF BRITAIN AS A PIONEERING  TRADING NATION  THE FIRST GROUP SAY STAYING IN A CUSTOMS UNION WILL SMOOTH COMMERCE WITH THE WORLD S LARGEST TRADING BLOC  IT WILL ALSO AVOID THE RETURN OF A  HARD  BORDER BETWEEN BRITISH RULED NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE IRISH REPUBLIC  THERE ARE FEARS THAT REINTRODUCING CHECKS ON WHAT WILL BE BRITAIN S ONLY LAND BORDER WITH THE EU COULD REIGNITE SECTARIAN VIOLENCE BREXIT SUPPORTERS SAY BRITAIN MUST QUIT THE CUSTOMS UNION TO PURSUE INDEPENDENT TRADE DEALS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES  WHICH THEY ARGUE IS A BIG ADVANTAGE OF LEAVING THE EU  THEY SAY BRITAIN CANNOT TRULY LEAVE THE EU WITHOUT LEAVING THE CUSTOMS UNION WHAT HAS THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSED SO FAR THE GOVERNMENT HAS PROPOSED TWO WAYS OF OVERCOMING THE DIFFICULTIES OF LEAVING THE CUSTOMS UNION AND AVOIDING THE NEED FOR BORDER CHECKS  A STREAMLINED CUSTOMS ARRANGEMENT OR A CUSTOMS PARTNERSHIP THE FIRST WOULD INVOLVE USING TECHNOLOGY TO LOWER CUSTOMS BARRIERS  MEASURES COULD INCLUDE PRE APPROVED  AUTHORIZED ECONOMIC OPERATORS  WHO ARE GIVEN FASTER CLEARANCE  AND PRE ARRIVAL NOTIFICATIONS LINKED TO CUSTOMS DECLARATIONS AND VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS SO TRUCKS DO NOT HAVE TO STOP AT BORDERS THE SECOND PROPOSAL WOULD ALIGN BRITAIN S APPROACH TO CUSTOMS WITH THE EU S  REMOVING THE NEED FOR A CUSTOMS BORDER  BRITAIN WOULD CONTINUE TO ACT AS IF IT WERE IN A CUSTOMS UNION WHEN DEALING WITH IMPORTS FROM ELSEWHERE  IF THEY ARE BOUND FOR EU MARKETS  BRITISH AUTHORITIES WOULD COLLECT THE TARIFFS AND PASS THEM TO THE EU WHAT DOES THE EU SAY THE EU HAS REJECTED BOTH PROPOSALS  EU OFFICIALS HAVE DISMISSED A  DIGITAL BORDER  AS UNREALISTIC  ONE EU DIPLOMAT TOLD REUTERS LAST MONTH IT IS AN  ELVES AND FAIRIES  SOLUTION  THEY HAVE ALSO SAID PLANS FOR A CUSTOMS PARTNERSHIP ARE TOO COMPLICATED AND ARE UNLIKELY TO WORK THE EU IS ALREADY DEMANDING BRITAIN PAY IT 2 7 BILLION EUROS IT HAS FAILED TO COLLECT DUE TO FRAUD ON CHINESE IMPORTS  EU OFFICIALS SAY THAT LONDON HAS LOST THEIR TRUST ON CUSTOMS COLLECTION AND ITS REFUSAL TO BE BOUND BY EU LAW AFTER BREXIT MAKES THEM UNWILLING TO CONSIDER THE PROPOSAL UNLESS A BETTER SOLUTION IS FOUND  THE EU HAS PREPARED AN EMERGENCY MECHANISM UNDER WHICH IT WOULD GO ON REGULATING TRADE WITH NORTHERN IRELAND AFTER BREXIT  THIS IS ANATHEMA TO LONDON AND NORTHERN IRELAND UNIONISTS  WHO SEE IT AS WEAKENING THE BRITISH PROVINCE S LINKS TO THE REST OF THE UNITED KINGDOM WHAT HAS THE OPPOSITION LABOUR PARTY PROPOSED  LABOUR HAS PROPOSED BRITAIN BEING IN A NEW KIND OF PERMANENT CUSTOMS UNION WITH THE EU  LONDON WOULD HAVE A SAY IN ANY FUTURE EU TRADE DEALS AND BE ABLE TO  NEGOTIATE AGREEMENT OF NEW TRADE DEALS IN OUR NATIONAL INTEREST WHAT ROLE DOES BRITAIN S PARLIAMENT HAVE IN THIS DEBATE  THE LOWER HOUSE OF COMMONS IS EXPECTED TO VOTE SOON ON WHETHER BRITAIN SHOULD LEAVE THE CUSTOMS UNION AND THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAY BE DEFEATED BY PRO EUROPEAN REBELS IN MAY S CONSERVATIVE PARTY SO FAR 10 CONSERVATIVE LAWMAKERS HAVE BACKED AN AMENDMENT TO PROPOSED TRADE LEGISLATION THAT SEEKS TO BIND THE GOVERNMENT INTO BEING IN A CUSTOMS UNION WITH THE EU  A SIMILAR AMENDMENT IS ALSO EXPECTED ON A CUSTOMS BILL CONSERVATIVE AND LABOUR SOURCES SAY OTHER LAWMAKERS ARE WILLING TO BACK THE AMENDMENT BUT GIVE NO NUMBERS THE VOTES COULD BE TIGHT  WITH THE SUPPORT OF A NORTHERN IRISH UNIONIST PARTY  MAY HAS A WORKING MAJORITY OF 13 SEATS  ALTHOUGH SOME PRO BREXIT LABOUR LAWMAKERS ARE EXPECTED TO VOTE WITH THE GOVERNMENT A SECOND FLASHPOINT IS THE EU WITHDRAWAL BILL   THE LEGISLATION THAT WILL FORMALLY END BRITISH MEMBERSHIP  THE UPPER HOUSE OF LORDS LAST MONTH CHALLENGED THE GOVERNMENT S PLANS TO LEAVE THE CUSTOMS UNION  WHEN WILL THE VOTES IN PARLIAMENT HAPPEN SOMETIME IN MAY  THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WILL CONSIDER THE AMENDMENT TO THE EU WITHDRAWAL BILL PASSED BY THE HOUSE OF LORDS  HOWEVER  THE AMENDMENT REQUIRES MINISTERS TO REPORT WHAT EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO SECURE A CUSTOMS UNION ONLY BY THE END OF OCTOBER  AND DOES NOT EXPLICITLY SAY BRITAIN MUST REACH A DEAL ON SUCH A UNION  SOME GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SAY THE VAGUE WORDING MEANS IT IS UNLIKELY TO CHANGE POLICY VOTES ON THE PROPOSED TRADE AND CUSTOMS LEGISLATION WILL BE MORE DANGEROUS FOR THE GOVERNMENT BUT A TIMETABLE HAS YET TO BE MADE PUBLIC  SOME CONSERVATIVE AND LABOUR LAWMAKERS SAY THEY COULD HAPPEN AS SOON AS THIS MONTH  OR DELAYED UNTIL THE AUTUMN THIS VERSION OF THE STORY REMOVES REFERENCE TO NORWAY IN SECOND PARA  WHICH HAS A TRADING ARRANGEMENT WITH THE EU THROUGH ITS

20180503,politics,trump,5,JUST LAST MONTH  PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HOW STORMY DANIELS RECEIVED  000 IN HUSH MONEY  HIS LAWYER  MICHAEL COHEN  HAS INSISTED FOR MONTHS THAT HE HAD KEPT MR  TRUMP COMPLETELY IN THE DARK AND THAT HE HAD HANDLED THE ENTIRE MATTER ON HIS OWN AS A PERSONAL FAVOR TO THE MAN FOR WHOM HE WOULD TAKE A BULLET ENTER RUDY GIULIANI  ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT  THE FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK AND MR  TRUMPS LATEST LEGAL FIXER WENT ON FOX NEWS  WHERE ELSE   TO OFFER A NEW VERSION OF THE STORMY DANIELS AFFAIR  THE PRESIDENT  MR  GIULIANI INSISTED  HAD IN FACT REIMBURSED MR  COHEN THE  000  EVEN THE SHOWS HOST  SEAN HANNITY  ANOTHER COHEN CLIENT  APPEARED STUNNED WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS GOING ON THE MOST GENEROUS READ OF WEDNESDAY NIGHTS SHOWPIECE IS THAT MR  GIULIANI AND MR  TRUMP HAVE MADE A CALCULATED DECISION THAT MR  COHEN FACES REAL LEGAL PERIL FOR HAVING GIVEN AN ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION IN THE FORM OF THE STORMY DANIELS PAYMENT  AND THAT MR  TRUMP MIGHT BE SUBJECT TO CO CONSPIRATOR LIABILITY  THE BEST DEFENSE AGAINST A COHEN CONVICTION  OR WORSE  A PLEA DEAL  ON THESE GROUNDS WOULD BE FOR MR  TRUMP TO TAKE CREDIT FOR THE PAYMENT  SINCE THE CANDIDATE CAN GIVE AS MUCH MONEY AS HE WANTS TO HIS OWN CAMPAIGN BUT WHATEVER THE PLAN  MR  GIULIANIS COMMENTS HAVE TURNED THE HEAT UP ON THE PRESIDENT JUDGING FROM MR  GIULIANIS CONTRIVED AND HAM HANDED DELIVERY  IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THIS WAS A HIGHLY COORDINATED AFFAIR  INDEED  ACCORDING TO ROBERT COSTA OF THE WASHINGTON POST  MR  GIULIANI SAID THE PRESIDENT WAS VERY PLEASED WITH HIS REMARKS IN THE MIDDLE OF A FRIENDLY CONVERSATION WITH MR  HANNITY  MR  GIULIANI INCONGRUOUSLY SHIFTED THE SUBJECT TO THE  000 PAYMENT TO STORMY DANIELS  WHICH  I MEAN  IS GOING TO TURN OUT TO BE PERFECTLY LEGAL  HE SAID  THAT MONEY WAS NOT CAMPAIGN MONEY  SORRY  IM GIVING YOU A FACT NOW THAT YOU DONT KNOW  ITS NOT CAMPAIGN MONEY  NO CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATION  THE FORMER MAYOR CONTINUED  THEY FUNNELED THROUGH A LAW FIRM  AND THE PRESIDENT REPAID IT HINT FOR POLITICAL FIXERS  AVOID USING THE WORD FUNNELED WHEN EXPLAINING WHY YOUR CLIENT DIDNT LAUNDER MONEY  IT TENDS TO SUGGEST THAT YOU ARE HIDING THE MONEYS TRUE SOURCE MR  GIULIANI FOLLOWED UP WITH A BOAST THAT DETRACTORS HAVE ALREADY PANNED AS CLASSIC RUDY  EVERYBODY WAS NERVOUS ABOUT THIS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING  I WASNT  I KNEW HOW MUCH MONEY DONALD TRUMP PUT INTO THAT CAMPAIGN  YET IN THE SAME BREATH  MR  GIULIANI ASSERTED THAT MR  TRUMP DIDNT KNOW ABOUT THE SPECIFICS OF IT  JUST THE GENERAL ARRANGEMENT  THAT MICHAEL WOULD TAKE CARE OF THINGS LIKE THIS HE THEN VEERED INTO THE PREPOSTEROUS  EXPLAINING THAT THE DANIELS PAYOUT WAS TOO INSIGNIFICANT TO BEAR MENTIONING  LIKE  I TAKE CARE OF THIS WITH MY CLIENTS  I DONT BURDEN THEM WITH EVERY SINGLE THING THAT COMES ALONG  THESE ARE BUSY PEOPLE THE BOTTOM LINE  ACCORDING TO MR  GIULIANI  MR  TRUMP KNEW ABOUT THE PAYMENT TO DANIELS AND REPAID MR  COHEN  HE NEEDS TO SELL THIS STORY SO THAT MR  COHENS PAYMENT WAS NOT A CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION  MORE ABOUT THAT BELOW  AND THAT MR  TRUMP DIDNT REALLY KNOW ABOUT THE ARRANGEMENT IN ADVANCE  AND SO HAS MINIMAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT IS TURNING OUT TO BE A COLOSSAL MESS WITH STORMY DANIELS THIS IS NOT A BIG  CLEAN TRUMPIAN LIE  IT IS MESSY AND CONVOLUTED AND FALLS APART WHEN YOU SPELL IT OUT  TRUMP DIDNT KNOW ABOUT THE SPECIFICS  BUT HE DID REPAY BECAUSE HE DID KNOW ABOUT THE GENERAL ARRANGEMENT  BUT HE DIDNT REALLY KNOW BECAUSE ITS JUST THE SORT OF THINGS LAWYERS DO FOR CLIENTS AND MR  COHEN DIDNT WANT TO BURDEN HIM SINCE HES A BUSY MAN  GOT THAT GOOD LUCK BEARING UP UNDER AN AGGRESSIVE CROSS EXAMINATION ON ALL THIS  IT MAY  IN FACT  COME TO THAT  BECAUSE AMONG THE MANY PROBLEMS WITH MR  GIULIANIS STORY IS THAT IT MAKES HIM A WITNESS TO IMPORTANT FACTS IN BOTH THE COHEN AND TRUMP INVESTIGATIONS IT ALSO  OF COURSE  INDICATES THAT MR  TRUMP WAS LYING WHEN HE SAID HE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE THAT MR  COHEN HAD PAID MS  DANIELS  PRESUMABLY THE CALCULATION OF TEAM TRUMP IS THAT HIS BASE EXACTS NO COST FOR EVEN THE BALDEST OF LIES  EVEN ONE OFFERED AS THE FINAL YOU CAN BELIEVE ME TRUTH AFTER MONTHS OF PREVARICATION MOREOVER  IF MR  GIULIANI BELIEVED THAT THIS LABORED ACCOUNT WOULD PUT MR  TRUMP AND THE CAMPAIGN IN THE CLEAR  HE WAS MOST LIKELY MISTAKEN  EVEN IF THE  000 PAYMENT WERE CONSTRUED AS A LOAN  IT WOULD STILL AMOUNT TO A CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION AND STILL NEED TO BE REPORTED  ITS TRUE THAT THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION HAS HISTORICALLY GONE LIGHTLY ON SUCH VIOLATIONS  BUT A KNOWING SCHEME TO VIOLATE ELECTION LAWS WOULD BE A CRIMINAL FELONY  AND ASSUMING THE CHARGE WOULD NOT FALL UNDER ROBERT MUELLERS JURISDICTION  THE PROSECUTORS IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK  WHERE MR  GIULIANI IS REMEMBERED AS A HEADLINE GRABBER  ARE AVAILABLE TO FILL THE BREACH ULTIMATELY  THERE SEEM TO BE TWO POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR MR  GIULIANIS PERFORMANCE ON FOX  THE FIRST IS HE WAS ACTING AS A FULLY AUTHORIZED AGENT FOR THE TRUMP CAMP  WHICH HAS MADE THE CALCULATION THAT SOME MIXTURE OF CONFUSION AND CONTRIVANCE IS THE PRESIDENTS BEST BET FOR MINIMIZING THE DAMAGE TO HIS PRESIDENCY FROM THE NETTLESOME DANIELS AFFAIR  THE SECOND IS THAT AS THE NEW LEGAL BOSS  HE HAD MR  TRUMPS GENERAL O K  AND WAS FREELANCING IN PART AND OFFERING THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF PARTIALLY BAKED SOLUTIONS GOING BACK TO MR  COHENS FIRST STORY EITHER WAY  AND IN KEEPING WITH THE TRADITION OF THIS WHITE HOUSE  TELLING THE TRUTH TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SEEMS TO HAVE PLAYED NO ROLE IN THE CALCULATIONS

20180507,politics,trump,4,WASHINGTON  PRESIDENT TRUMP IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE ON TUESDAY THAT HE IS WITHDRAWING THE UNITED STATES FROM THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL  EUROPEAN DIPLOMATS SAID AFTER CONCLUDING THAT THEY HAD FAILED TO CONVINCE HIM THAT RENEGING ON AMERICAS COMMITMENT TO THE PACT COULD CAST THE WEST INTO NEW CONFRONTATION WITH TEHRAN IF THE DIPLOMATS ARE CORRECT  THE ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL NATIONAL SECURITY DECISION OF MR  TRUMPS 15 MONTHS IN OFFICE  THOUGH IT COULD BE ECLIPSED IN COMING WEEKS BY HIS DIRECT NEGOTIATION WITH NORTH KOREAS LEADER OVER SURRENDERING ITS NUCLEAR ARSENAL ONE SENIOR EUROPEAN DIPLOMAT WHO HAS BEEN DEEPLY INVOLVED IN TRYING TO PERSUADE MR  TRUMP TO STAY IN THE DEAL TOLD REPORTERS ON MONDAY THE CHANCE THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD KEEP THE AGREEMENT INTACT WAS VERY SMALL AT THE HEART OF THE DEAL TO LIMIT IRANS NUCLEAR PROGRAM  WHICH WAS REACHED IN JULY 2015 AFTER MORE THAN TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF NEGOTIATION  LAY A BOLD TRADE THE WEST WOULD END THREE DECADES OF SANCTIONS AND ISOLATION OF TEHRAN THAT HAD CRIPPLED THE COUNTRYS ECONOMY AND FUELED DOMESTIC IMPATIENCE WITH ITS CLERICAL LEADERS  IN RETURN  IRAN AGREED TO SHIP ROUGHLY 97 PERCENT OF ITS NUCLEAR FUEL OUT OF THE COUNTRY  AND FORGO PRODUCTION OF NUCLEAR FUEL  EVEN FOR OSTENSIBLY PEACEFUL PURPOSES THE NEGOTIATION WITH IRAN WAS THE SIGNATURE FOREIGN POLICY ACHIEVEMENT OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION  AND THROUGHOUT THE 2016 CAMPAIGN MR  TRUMP CALLED IT A DISASTER AND INSANE BUT FOR MORE THAN A YEAR  HE WAS RELUCTANTLY PERSUADED BY ADVISERS THAT IT WAS BETTER THAN ANY ALTERNATIVE  AND THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD NO PLAN B IF IT WAS THE FIRST TO BREACH THE ARRANGEMENTS  THOSE ADVISERS  REX W  TILLERSON AND LT  GEN  H  R  MCMASTER  WERE OUSTED IN RECENT MONTHS AND REPLACED WITH TWO OF THE IRAN AGREEMENTS MOST VOCIFEROUS CRITICS  SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO AND JOHN R  BOLTON  THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER IN THE 28 MONTHS SINCE THE ARRANGEMENT WENT INTO EFFECT  INTERNATIONAL INSPECTORS HAVE SAID THEY HAVE FOUND NO VIOLATIONS  APART FROM MINOR INFRACTIONS THAT WERE QUICKLY RECTIFIED UNDER THE DEAL  THE RESTRICTIONS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN IRANS NUCLEAR PROGRAM WOULD BEGIN TO LIFT AFTER A DECADE  AFTER 15 YEARS  IRAN WOULD BE ABLE TO PRODUCE AS MUCH FUEL AS IT WANTED  THOUGH NEVER FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING WEAPONS MR  TRUMP HAS INSISTED THAT SUNSET CLAUSE SIMPLY PUT OFF THE DAY WHEN IRAN WOULD BECOME A NUCLEAR ARMED STATE  THE AGREEMENT  HE HAS SAID  FAILED TO ADDRESS TEHRANS GROWING MISSILE CAPABILITY AND EXPANDING INFLUENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST  ALL FUNDED  HE INSISTED  FROM CASH THAT WAS RETURNED TO THE IRANIANS AS A PART OF THE DEAL  AS WELL AS ITS RESUMED OIL TRADE THE SENIOR EUROPEAN DIPLOMAT  WHO SPOKE ON THE CONDITION OF ANONYMITY WHEN MEETING WITH A GROUP OF REPORTERS ON MONDAY  CALLED IT PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT MR  TRUMP WOULD NO LONGER WAIVE AMERICAN SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN  AS HE HAS DONE SINCE THE START OF HIS PRESIDENCY TO UPHOLD THE DEAL RATHER THAN PUSH THE ISSUES OFF FOR ANOTHER DECADE  MR  TRUMP IS BETTING HE CAN FORCE IRAN INTO A NEW NEGOTIATION IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE PRESIDENT MIGHT MOLLIFY THREE MAJOR ALLIES  BRITAIN  FRANCE AND GERMANY  BY ALLOWING THEM TO MAINTAIN ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH TEHRAN WITHOUT PENALIZING ANY OF THEIR FIRMS  BUT EUROPEAN OFFICIALS SAID THAT WAS NOT CLEAR MR  TRUMP ISSUED TWO TWEETS ON MONDAY ABOUT THE COMING DECISION  THE FIRST BERATED JOHN KERRY  THE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE  FOR HIS POSSIBLY ILLEGAL SHADOW DIPLOMACY ON THE VERY BADLY NEGOTIATED IRAN DEAL  IT WAS AN APPARENT REFERENCE TO MR  KERRYS CALLS TO LEADERS AROUND THE WORLD LOOKING FOR WAYS TO SAVE AN ACCORD THAT HE DEDICATED MUCH OF HIS TERM TO NEGOTIATING DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION A FEW HOURS LATER  MR  TRUMP TURNED TO TWITTER AGAIN TO DECLARE THAT HE WOULD BE ANNOUNCING HIS DECISION AT 2 P M  TUESDAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE HOWEVER THE WHITE HOUSE ENGINEERS THE SPECIFICS OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT  DIPLOMATS SAY THEY ARE NOW ADJUSTING TO A NEW REALITY IN WHICH THE FUNDAMENTAL TRADE WITH IRAN IS DEAD IT CANT BE SAVED  SAID AARON DAVID MILLER  A LONGTIME FORMER DIPLOMAT NOW AT THE WILSON INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR SCHOLARS  WHATEVER TRUMP DECIDES  ITS THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE ACCORD  EITHER DEATH BY ONE  OR 1 000  CUTS OVER THE PAST THREE WEEKS  SENIOR OFFICIALS FROM FRANCE  BRITAIN AND GERMANY FLEW TO WASHINGTON TO MAKE A CASE THAT DITCHING THE ACCORD WAS A DIPLOMATIC MISTAKE  ON SUNDAY  BORIS JOHNSON  THE BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY  WAS THE LAST TO MAKE THOSE ARGUMENTS  WRITING IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT NOW THAT THESE HANDCUFFS ARE IN PLACE  I SEE NO POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE IN CASTING THEM ASIDE BY THE MIDDLE OF MONDAY  HIS VISIT SEEMED A LAST GASP  HE WAS TOLD THAT THE DECISION WAS ALL BUT PREORDAINED  OFFICIALS SAID PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON OF FRANCE AND CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL OF GERMANY SIMILARLY ARGUED THAT THE IRAN ACCORD WAS FLAWED BUT COULD BE BUILT UPON  THE ALLIES HAD SUGGESTED THAT THE WEST COULD IMPOSE NEW SANCTIONS AGAINST IRANS BALLISTIC MISSILE DEVELOPMENT AND ARMED SUPPORT FOR THE SYRIAN REGIME  FOR HEZBOLLAH  FOR HAMAS AND ISLAMIC JIHAD IN THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES  BUT KEEP THE NUCLEAR DEAL INTACT MY VIEW  I DONT KNOW WHAT YOUR PRESIDENT WILL DECIDE  IS THAT HE WILL GET RID OF THIS DEAL ON HIS OWN  FOR DOMESTIC REASONS  MR  MACRON TOLD A GROUP OF REPORTERS IN WASHINGTON DURING HIS VISIT LAST MONTH BUT IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT FOR EUROPEANS TO ANSWER MR  TRUMPS DEMANDS BECAUSE IT IS CLEAR THAT IRAN WILL NOT AGREE TO REOPENING THE TERMS OF THE ACCORD ITSELF  AND IF IT WERE TO BE REOPENED  IRAN HAD A SERIES OF DEMANDS OF ITS OWN SHOULD MR  TRUMP WITHDRAW FROM THE ACCORD  IRAN COULD ACCURATELY CLAIM THAT WASHINGTON WAS THE FIRST TO VIOLATE IT  A PROPAGANDA WIN  AND IRAN WOULD BE FREE  IF IT CHOSE  TO RESUME FUEL PRODUCTION  ACCORDING TO DIPLOMATS WHO SPOKE ON THE CONDITION OF ANONYMITY TO DISCUSS THE SENSITIVE NEGOTIATIONS THE MANTRA OF THE EUROPEAN NEGOTIATORS TOILING TO RETAIN THE NUCLEAR DEAL HAS BEEN TO FIX IT  NOT NIX IT  BUT MR  TRUMP HAS COME AT THE PROBLEM FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE  HE ARGUES THAT THE ONLY SOLUTION IS A CLEAN SLATE MR  TRUMP HAS TOLD VISITORS HE BELIEVES THAT ONCE THE CURRENT AGREEMENT IS DESTROYED  IRAN WILL COME TO THE TABLE TO NEGOTIATE A NEW ONE  IRANS FOREIGN MINISTER  MOHAMMAD JAVAD ZARIF  WHO NEGOTIATED THE INITIAL ACCORD WITH MR  KERRY FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS  HAS SAID TEHRAN WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN SUCH NEGOTIATIONS SINCE IT ALREADY SPENT YEARS DOING SO THE NARROW DECISION MR  TRUMP WILL HAVE TO ANNOUNCE ON TUESDAY IS WHETHER HE IS WILLING TO ONCE AGAIN WAIVE AMERICAN SANCTIONS ON IRAN  HOLDING UP AMERICAS COMMITMENTS UNDER THE DEAL YET EVEN IF MR  TRUMP REIMPOSES THOSE SANCTIONS  EUROPEANS NOTE THAT THERE ARE SOME DELAYS BUILT INTO THE ACCORD  A RECONCILIATION PERIOD OF ABOUT A MONTH  AND DELAYS OF 120 TO 180 DAYS BEFORE RENEWED AMERICAN SANCTIONS BITE IN A WORLD OF TRUMP BRINKMANSHIP  ALL THAT COULD ALLOW TIME FOR FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS IRAN CAN GO TO THE BRINK AS WELL  HOWEVER  AND ANTICIPATING ITS RESPONSE IS DIFFICULT  HARD LINERS ARE ALREADY ARGUING TO RESUME URANIUM ENRICHMENT AND PLUTONIUM PRODUCTION  BUT IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE IRAN WILL CHOOSE TO ABIDE BY THE DEAL FOR NOW  TO MAKE SHARPER THE SPLIT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND ITS EUROPEAN ALLIES THAT MAY NOT BE SUSTAINABLE  EUROPEAN OFFICIALS SAID  OVER TIME  PRESSURE WILL GROW INSIDE IRAN TO LEAVE  SINCE MANY THERE BELIEVE THE SANCTIONS RELIEF HAS NOT LED TO THE KIND OF NATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIVAL THAT THE COUNTRYS PUBLIC WAS TOLD TO EXPECT IRANS LEADERS HAVE BEEN CRYPTIC ABOUT ITS POTENTIAL RESPONSE IF AMERICA LEAVES THE NUCLEAR DEAL  THIS WILL ENTAIL HISTORIC REGRET FOR IT  PRESIDENT HASSAN ROUHANI OF IRAN SAID IN A SPEECH BROADCAST LIVE ON STATE TELEVISION IN RECENT DAYS IF WE CAN GET WHAT WE WANT FROM A DEAL WITHOUT AMERICA  THEN IRAN WILL CONTINUE TO REMAIN COMMITTED TO THE DEAL  MR  ROUHANI SAID THE EUROPEANS ARE ALSO WORRIED THAT ABANDONING THE DEAL WILL EMBOLDEN ISRAEL IN ITS OWN STRUGGLE WITH IRAN IN SYRIA AND LEBANON  THAT COULD LEAD TO ANOTHER BLOODY WAR  AS IRANIAN TROOPS AND PROXIES MOVE CLOSER TO THE OCCUPIED GOLAN HEIGHTS AND TEHRAN CONTINUES TO SHIP MISSILES INTO SYRIA AND SOUTHERN LEBANON ODDLY  WHILE PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU OF ISRAEL HAS LED THE CHARGE TO PERSUADE MR  TRUMP TO ABANDON THE DEAL  HIS TOP MILITARY ADVISERS HAVE DISSENTED  THE COMMANDER OF THE ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES  GADI EIZENKOT  HAS REPEATEDLY SAID THAT THE AGREEMENT IS WORKING AND DELAYING IRANS EFFORTS TO OBTAIN A WEAPON BY A DECADE TO 15 YEARS  FORMER MILITARY OFFICIALS HAVE LARGELY AGREED BUT MR  TRUMPS BASE OF SUPPORTERS HAS INSISTED THAT THE DEAL ESSENTIALLY SOLD OUT LONG RANGE AMERICAN INTERESTS  AFTER HESITATING  MR  TRUMP APPEARS TO HAVE DECIDED TO MAKE GOOD ON HIS PAST PROMISES

BASKETBALL TEAM  WHAT HE GRINDED FOR AS A 15 YEAR OLD RUNNING STADIUM STEPS UNTIL HE COLLAPSED  WHAT HE PLAYED FOR AS A 6 FOOT 8  SWEET SHOOTING  IVY LEAGUE STAR AT BROWN UNIVERSITY BUT BASKETBALL GAVE MR  HALPERN NONE OF IT  IN FACT  IT WASNT UNTIL THE GAME HE LOVED WAS SNATCHED FROM HIM HALFWAY THROUGH HIS COLLEGIATE CAREER THAT HE FOUND ANOTHER WAY TO ACHIEVE HIS CHILDHOOD DREAMS UNTIL THAT POINT  MR  HALPERN  28  HAD SEEMED BOUND FOR A PRO BASKETBALL CAREER  NOW HE IS A D J  MUSIC PRODUCER AND ONE HALF OF THE GRAMMY NOMINATED DANCE POP DUO SOFI TUKKER  IT IS THEIR SONG BEST FRIEND THAT WAS FEATURED IN THE COMMERCIAL THAT ACCOMPANIED THE DEBUT OF THE IPHONE X  IT IS THEIR MUSIC THAT HAS TOPPED CHARTS FROM BELARUS TO THE UNITED STATES AND THAT HAS MR  HALPERN MAKING THE LATE NIGHT TALK SHOW ROUNDS THIS NEW PASSION WAS IGNITED BY A COMPUTER MUSIC PROGRAM  NURTURED BY HOW TO VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE AND PERFECTED BY A CHANCE MEETING WITH ANOTHER ECLECTICALLY WIRED BROWN CLASSMATE IN SOPHIE HAWLEY WELD  AND IT HAS PRODUCED A CAREER THAT WAS ALL FORCED UPON HIM BY AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE THAT ONCE PUT HIM IN BED FOR EIGHT TERRIFYING MONTHS AFTER EARNING ALL IVY HONORABLE MENTION HONORS IN 2011 AS A SOPHOMORE  MR  HALPERN WAS SIDELINED BY FATIGUE FROM WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS A PERSISTENT CASE OF MONONUCLEOSIS  MONTHS OF HOSPITAL STAYS AND MEDICAL TESTS RULED OUT EVERYTHING FROM CANCER TO BLOOD DISEASES  BUT THEY DID LITTLE TO GET HIM BACK ON HIS FEETMR  HALPERN WITHDREW FROM BROWN AND RETURNED TO HIS FAMILY HOME IN BROOKLINE  MASS  WHERE HE ESCAPED HIS BEDROOM ONLY ON RARE LUNCH OUTINGS WITH HIS MOTHER  HE WAS SCARED  BORED AND DEPRESSED  HE NEEDED TO GET OUT OF HIS OWN HEAD  READING WASNT AN OPTION  MR  HALPERN SAYS HE IS SLIGHTLY DYSLEXIC BUT HE DID PLAY THE DRUMS AS A CHILD AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN TAKEN BY MUSIC SO I LAID THERE WITH THE LAPTOP  PUSHING BUTTONS AND WATCHING VIDEOS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE SAMPLES AND BEATS  MR  HALPERN SAID  PRETTY SOON  I WAS REACHING FOR MY COMPUTER AS SOON AS I WOKE UP AND WORKING ON MUSIC UNTIL I FELL ASLEEP HE WAS ABLE TO MANAGE THE FATIGUE WELL ENOUGH TO RETURN TO BROWN IN THE FALL OF 2012 FOR HIS JUNIOR SEASON  BUT HE SOON REALIZED HE WAS JUST A SHADOW OF HIMSELF  A HEARTBREAKING EPIPHANY  AFTER THE BEST GAME THAT HE EVER PLAYED  PUSHED HIM EVEN FURTHER INTO MUSIC  IN A NATIONALLY TELEVISED MATCHUP THAT DECEMBER AGAINST PROVIDENCE  MR  HALPERN HIT THE WINNING SHOT  HIS EIGHTH 3 POINTER OF THE NIGHT  TO UPSET THE FRIARS I SAT DOWN AND CRIED  HE SAID  I WAS SO EXHAUSTED I COULDNT CELEBRATE  I KNEW IT WAS OVER  MY BODY COULDNT DO IT THE NEXT SUMMER  DR  SCOTT HAMMER  AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALIST  MADE IT OFFICIAL  HE TOLD ME I WAS GOING TO KILL MYSELF  MR  HALPERN SAID  AND HE WOULD NOT CLEAR ME TO PLAY   IT WAS NOT UNTIL MONTHS LATER THAT MR  HALPERN WAS TOLD HE HAD A SEVERE STRAIN OF THE EPSTEIN BARR VIRUS  WHICH CAUSES MONONUCLEOSIS AND OFTEN PRESENTS  AS IT DID IN HALPERNS CASE  WITH SYMPTOMS LIKE DEBILITATING FATIGUE ON THE DAY IN 2013 WHEN DR  HAMMER TOLD HIM HIS BASKETBALL CAREER WAS OVER  MR  HALPERN STOPPED AT A MUSIC STORE AND BOUGHT A D J  SETUP AND SPEAKER  HE PROMISED HIS PARENTS HE WOULD FINISH HIS STUDIES OF THE HISTORY OF ART AND ARCHITECTURE  AND GRADUATE  BUT HE ALREADY HAD ANOTHER PLAN IN MIND IM SURE THE LAST THING THEY WANTED TO HEAR WAS THAT I WANTED TO BE A D J  MR  HALPERN SAID JUST AS HE ONCE ROAMED PLAYGROUNDS AND GYMS IN SEARCH OF PICKUP BASKETBALL GAMES  MR  HALPERN HUSTLED D J  GIGS AROUND CAMPUS  HE LUGGED HIS GEAR AND SPEAKERS TO MIDNIGHT HOUSE PARTIES OR

20180503,business,market,1,TWENTY YEARS AGO  RIDING A BIKE THROUGH NEW YORK CITY WAS SEEN AS CRAZY  A RADICAL ACT RESERVED FOR BIKE MESSENGERS  DIE HARD COMMUTERS AND FORMER TALKING HEADS FRONTMEN TODAY  THE CITY IS COVERED IN GREEN LANES FILLED WITH TOURISTS ON CITI BIKES  LAWLESS DELIVERY MEN ON ELECTRIC BIKES AND HIPSTERS COASTING ON DUTCH UTILITY BIKES OR BRAKELESS FIXIES  BUT ONE TYPE OF BICYCLE THAT IS RARELY SEEN IS A MOUNTAIN BIKE  ITS KNOBBY TIRES TOO CUMBERSOME IN MIDTOWN TRAFFIC  ITS HANDLEBARS TOO WIDE TO SQUEEZE BETWEEN TAXI CABS IN WESTCHESTER COUNTY  HOWEVER  THE MOUNTAIN BIKE THRIVES ON THE GNARLED  ROCKY TRAILS OF BLUE MOUNTAIN RESERVATION IN PEEKSKILL OR SPRAIN RIDGE PARK IN YONKERS  AND THESE ARE THE LANDSCAPES THAT THOMAS CALLAHAN HAS IN MIND WHEN WELDING TOGETHER HIS LATEST CREATION MR  CALLAHAN  38  IS A LIFELONG BIKE FANATIC AND THE OWNER OF HORSE CYCLES  A CUSTOM BICYCLE COMPANY BASED IN WILLIAMSBURG THAT HE FOUNDED IN 2007  KNOWN MAINLY FOR GORGEOUS STEEL FRAMED URBAN BIKES  MR  CALLAHAN RECENTLY TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO BUILDING WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS THE ULTIMATE EAST COAST TRAIL BIKE THE TRAILS AROUND HERE ARE REALLY TECHNICAL  SO YOU DONT GET MANY SMOOTH  EASY CLIMBS  MR  CALLAHAN SAID  I WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT GIVES ME MORE STABILITY AND STRENGTH WHEN CLIMBING  BUT ALSO WILL ALLOW ME TO START RIDING MORE CHALLENGING  BIGGER  STEEPER TERRAIN TO DO THIS  HOWEVER  MR  CALLAHAN DID NOT HAVE TO REINVENT THE BIKE FRAME  UNLIKE THE BIG BIKE COMPANIES  WHICH SEEM TO INTRODUCE A REVOLUTIONARY NEW PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY EVERY SEASON  MR  CALLAHAN IS INSTEAD TAKING A DECIDEDLY OLD SCHOOL APPROACH THE FRAME  NAMED THE HELL CAT IN HONOR OF HIS PET TABBY  CHARLES  MAY LOOK LIKE ANY OF THE DOZENS OF OTHERS SITTING IN APARTMENTS OR CHAINED TO STREET SIGNS AROUND THE CITY  BUT THERE ARE SUBTLE DIFFERENCES THAT MR  CALLAHAN SAYS MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE AFTER SPENDING YEARS RIDING DOZENS OF MOUNTAIN BIKES  TESTING MULTIPLE DESIGNS AND DISCUSSING THE PROS AND CONS OF EACH WITH FRIENDS AND CUSTOMERS  MR  CALLAHAN SAID HE HAS FIGURED OUT AN IDEAL CONFIGURATION FOR NEW YORKS TECHNICAL TERRAIN MOST MOUNTAIN BIKES ARE DESIGNED WITH RIDERS OUT WEST IN MIND  LOTS OF CUSHY SUSPENSION  BUILT FOR LONG  SMOOTH CLIMBS AND FAST  ROLLING DESCENTS  THESE ARE NOT THE CONDITIONS THAT MR  CALLAHAN HAS IN MIND FOR THE HELL CAT THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FRAME OF THE HELL CAT AND OTHER MOUNTAIN BIKES IS ITS EXTREMELY LONG AND SLOPING TOP TUBE  WHICH HELPS EVEN OUT A RIDERS WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION  THIS HELPS BOTH PREVENT THE FRONT WHEEL FROM RISING UP IN THE AIR ON STEEP  ROCKY CLIMBS AND FROM PITCHING A RIDER FORWARD ON EQUALLY STEEP DOWNHILLS I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I WASNT GOING TO GO RIGHT OVER THE BARS ON A DESCENT  MR  CALLAHAN SAID ALONG WITH THE TOP TUBE  MR  CALLAHAN ALSO GAVE THE FRAME A SHORT REAR TRIANGLE TO MAKE IT MORE NIMBLE ON THE EAST COASTS TIGHT SINGLE TRACK TRAILS AND TO AID IN THE POWER TRANSFER WHILE PEDALING INSTEAD OF TRYING TO COMPETE WITH TOP OF THE LINE  FULL SUSPENSION BIKES FROM BIG BRANDS LIKE CANNONDALE AND TREK  THESE HAVE A GIANT  SHOCK ABSORBING SPRING OR PISTON BUILT INTO THE FRAME  THE HELL CAT IS A THROWBACK TO THE FIRST GENERATION OF MOUNTAIN BIKES  IT IS WHATS KNOWN AS A HARDTAIL  A RIGID  HIGH GRADE STEEL FRAME  WITH ONLY A FRONT SUSPENSION FORK ITS AN APPROPRIATION OF AN OLD DESIGN  MR  CALLAHAN SAID  ADDING THAT HE DREW INFLUENCE FROM MOUNTAIN BIKINGS FOUNDERS FATHERS FROM THE LATE 1970S AND EARLY 1980S  I TOOK THAT DESIGN AND PUSHED AND TWEAKED IT TO MAKE IT MORE CAPABLE ON TODAYS TRAILS MR  CALLAHAN NOTED THAT HARDTAIL BIKES ARE IDEAL FOR CYCLISTS ON THE EAST COAST WHO DONT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE MASSIVE SIX FOOT DROPS AND BIG TERRAIN THAT THEIR COHORTS OUT WEST DO INSTEAD  THE ROOT  AND ROCK COVERED TRAILS AND PUNCHY CLIMBS AROUND NEW YORK REQUIRE A STIFFER FRAME AND THE ABILITY TO RUN SOME OF THE WIDEST MOUNTAIN BIKE TIRES ON THE MARKET YOU CAN RUN THOSE TIRES AT VERY LOW PRESSURE SO THEYLL ROLL OVER OBSTACLES MUCH EASIER  HE SAID  THEY ARE BETTER AND STRONGER AND MAKE THE RIDE MORE COMFORTABLE SITTING IN HIS WILLIAMSBURG WORKSHOP EARLIER THIS WEEK AMID A SLEW OF HALF FINISHED BIKE FRAMES  MOTORCYCLES IN VARIOUS STATES OF REPAIR  SURFBOARDS AND METALWORKING EQUIPMENT DATING BACK TO THE 1940S  MR  CALLAHAN WORKED ON THE DETAILS OF THE HELL CAT  IT WAS ALMOST FINISHED  BUT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A WHILE BEFORE THE BIKE HITS THE DIRT  AND EVEN LONGER BEFORE ANYONE ELSE GETS THEIR HANDS ON A HELL CAT ALONG WITH A PACKED SCHEDULE OF OTHER CUSTOM RIGS  MR  CALLAHAN HAS TO HAVE THE BIKE CUSTOM PAINTED IN HIS IN HOUSE SHOP AND WAIT FOR THE OTHER CUSTOM PARTS HES ORDERED TO BE ANODIZED AND SHIPPED OVER MOUNTAIN BIKING IS NOT A CHEAP SPORT  A TOP OF THE LINE CANNONDALE CAN COST MORE THAN  000  AND FOR THOSE HOPING TO GET A HELL CAT OF THEIR OWN  IT WILL TAKE SOME MONEY AS WELL AS PATIENCE  THE HELL CAT FRAME ALONE COSTS  200  AND A FULLY CUSTOMIZED BIKE  TAILORED TO A RIDERS GEOMETRY AND WITH A PERSONALIZED PAINT JOB  TAKES ABOUT EIGHT WEEKS  START TO FINISH ITS TIME CONSUMING  BUT WHAT YOU GET IN THE END IS A HIGH QUALITY BIKE THAT IS CUSTOM MADE FOR YOU  MR  CALLAHAN SAID  ITS A TOOL FOR ADVENTURE
20180501,entertainment,fashion,9,BERLIN  AS VIRTUAL REALITY BREAKS INTO THE ART WORLD AT ALL LEVELS  A HOST OF QUESTIONS ABOUT CURATION  CONSERVATION AND COMMERCIAL VALUE IS STILL BEING EXPLORED THE BERLIN BASED ARTIST OLAFUR ELIASSON SAID THAT WE WERE ONLY IN THE STONE AGE OR PREHISTORIC PERIOD FOR THE MEDIUM THERE IS A NEW SPACE OUT THERE WHERE A LOT MORE PEOPLE WILL HAVE ACCESS TO ARTISTIC EXPERIENCE  HE SAID LAST WEEK IN A PANEL DISCUSSION HERE AT THE ART LEADERS NETWORK HOSTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES  HE ADDED THAT THE QUALITY OF THE GLASSES IS GETTING SO MUCH INTENSELY BETTER OVER THE THREE YEARS HE HAS BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH VIRTUAL REALITY THE TECHNOLOGY IS FAR FROM UBIQUITOUS  BUT COMPANIES SUCH AS SAMSUNG  GOOGLE AND MICROSOFT ARE INVESTED IN ITS FUTURE  AND SOME RECENT STUDIES FORECAST RAPID GROWTH FOR VIRTUAL  AND AUGMENTED REALITY HEADSETS IN THE YEARS AHEAD FOR THE ONLINE PLATFORM ACUTE ART  WHICH WENT LIVE LAST FALL  MR  ELIASSON CREATED THE WORK RAINBOW  WHICH HE DESCRIBED IN AN INTERVIEW AT THE ART LEADERS NETWORK AS ABSTRACT AND IMMERSIVE BUT ALSO VERY PLAYFUL YOU CAN PUT YOUR HAND IN THE RAIN AND SWISH THE DROPS AROUND  HE SAID  IT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE TO GIVE IT AN EPHEMERAL QUALITY  BUT I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE RESULT IN APRIL  ACUTE ARTS VR MUSEUM INTRODUCED A SUBSCRIPTION PROGRAM TO EXPERIENCE WORKS BY MR  ELIASSON AND THE PERFORMANCE ARTIST MARINA ABRAMOVIC WHILE DISTRIBUTING THE OUTPUT OF FIVE OTHER ARTISTS FREE OF CHARGE FOR NONSUBSCRIBERS THE WEBSITE WORKS WITH THREE BRANDS OF VIRTUAL REALITY HEADSETS MR  ELIASSON ENVISIONS A FUTURE IN WHICH PEOPLE ACCESS ART ON A PLATFORM LIKE NETFLIX ONCE THE NECESSARY EQUIPMENT IS MORE WIDESPREAD AND THE BUSINESS MODEL MORE DEVELOPED  RAINBOW WAS PRESENTED IN MARCH AT THE CONTEMPORARY EXHIBITION SPACE KUNSTHAL CHARLOTTENBORG DURING THE COPENHAGEN INTERNATIONAL DOCUMENTARY FILM FESTIVAL IF VIRTUAL REALITY HAS PROVED USEFUL AS AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL THROUGH RECENT INITIATIVES SUCH AS A RE CREATION OF MODIGLIANIS LAST PARISIAN STUDIO AT THE TATE MODERN IN LONDON  IT IS STILL ASSERTING ITSELF AS AN ARTISTIC FORM IN ITS OWN RIGHT  A PANEL DISCUSSION WITH SANDRA NEDVETSKAIA  PARTNER OF THE VIRTUAL REALITY PRODUCTION COMPANY KHORA CONTEMPORARY  AND EDWARD KLARIS  AN ADVISER AND LAWYER SPECIALIZING IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  ADDRESSED SOME OF THE ISSUES AT STAKE WHILE A PAINTING IS ACQUIRED THROUGH A SINGLE SALE PAYMENT  MR  KLARIS SAID  VIRTUAL REALITY WORKS MAY DEMAND A MONETIZATION PLAN MORE ALONG THE LINES OF THE FILM INDUSTRY  AN ARTIST WHO CREATES SUCH A WORK MIGHT BE PAID EVERY TIME IT IS SOLD OR DISTRIBUTED  HE SAID KHORA CONTEMPORARY WAS FOUNDED  HOWEVER  WITH THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF HELPING ESTABLISHED AND YOUNG ARTISTS TRANSLATE THEIR WORK INTO THE REALM OF VIRTUAL REALITY  THE COMPANY WAS INAUGURATED AT LAST YEARS VENICE BIENNALE WITH COMMISSIONED WORKS BY PAUL MCCARTHY AND CHRISTIAN LEMMERZ MS  NEDVETSKAIA CITED A TRIANGULAR BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVING THE ARTIST  PRODUCTION COMPANY AND GALLERY  THE STRUCTURE VARIES ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS  KHORA CONTEMPORARY IS ALSO IN TALKS WITH FILM FESTIVALS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC  DOWN THE LINE  MS  NEDVETSKAIA ENVISIONS CREATING PAY PER VIEW VERSIONS OF ARTWORK ONLINE SHE POINTED TO VIRTUAL REALITY AS A NEW FRONTIER FOR ARTISTS AT A TIME WHEN ALL OTHER FORMS AND GENRES HAVE BEEN EXPLORED  THERE IS LITTLE TODAY WHICH IS BRAND NEW  SHE SAID BUT THE COLLECTOR BASE IS JUST DEVELOPING  IT IS TOO EARLY TO TALK ABOUT AT THIS POINT  SHE SAID OF A VERY NASCENT MARKET WHILE MENTIONING SALES IN ASIA AND THE INTEREST OF PRIVATE MUSEUMS AND COLLECTIONS THE SALON BERLIN OF THE MUSEUM FRIEDER BURDA  A PRIVATE COLLECTION IN BADEN BADEN  GERMANY  IS DISPLAYING ITS FIRST VIRTUAL REALITY COMPONENT WITH THE BRIDGE  BY THE UKRANIAN ARTIST NIKITA SHALENNY PRESENTED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH KHORA CONTEMPORARY AND PART OF THE EXHIBITION BACK TO NATURE   WHICH RUNS THROUGH AUG  18  THE WORK ILLUSTRATES A BLEAK VISION OF THE HUMAN RACE RUNNING AND SWIMMING THROUGH A BLACK AND WHITE LANDSCAPE THE SALONS CURATOR  PATRICIA KAMP  POINTED TO THE IRONY THAT  IN AN EXHIBITION EXPLORING THE ALIENATION FROM NATURE IN MODERN SOCIETY  VIRTUAL REALITY REPRESENTS A CRUCIAL MEANS OF HARNESSING YOUNGER VISITORS WHEN ART DOESNT MOVE PEOPLE EMOTIONALLY  IT HAS NO PURPOSE  SHE SAID  THE NEXT GENERATION ONLY GROWS UP WITH SCREENS  THEY HAVE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT POINT OF ACCESS THE BRIDGE IS JUXTAPOSED WITH BOTH MODERN AND CONTEMPORARY PAINTINGS IN AN EFFORT TO CREATE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT MEDIUMS  MS  NEDVETSKAIA ALSO MENTIONED THE POSSIBILITY OF EXHIBITING VIRTUAL REALITY WORKS ALONGSIDE THE PHYSICAL MATERIAL ON WHICH THEY WERE BASED  SUCH AS SHALENNYS WATERCOLORS OR VIDEO DIRECTED BY MR  MCCARTHY IT MAKES IT MORE BELIEVABLE  SHE SAID IN AN INTERVIEW  IT GIVES PEOPLE THE CONFIDENCE THAT IT CAN BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AS A REAL ART FORM AS GLENN D  LOWRY  DIRECTOR OF THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART IN NEW YORK  SAID DURING THE ART LEADERS NETWORK PANEL THE FUTURE OF ART MUSEUMS  CONTEMPORARY ART HAD TRANSCENDED FORMAL LABELS THERE USE TO BE THESE CATEGORIES  HE SAID  HIGH ART  FASHION  COMMERCE  YOU

MERITED A MENTION IN THE LOCAL NEWS MEDIA  BUT WHILE EGYPT IS KNOWN FOR ITS MUMMIES  IRAN CERTAINLY IS NOT  HERE  THE DEAD ARE BURIED IN LOOSE WHITE CLOTH  AND THE BODIES QUICKLY DECOMPOSE THE OPERATOR OF THE EXCAVATOR SNAPPED A SELFIE WITH THE MUMMIFIED CORPSE LAST MONTH AND POSTED IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA  WHERE IT SPAWNED AN ENTICING THEORY THAT SPREAD WIDELY  THE REMAINS MUST BE THOSE OF REZA SHAH PAHLAVI  THE COSSACK BRIGADE OFFICER WHOM THE BRITISH HELPED INSTALL AS SHAH IN 1925  BEGINNING A FAMILY DYNASTY THAT LASTED 54 YEARS THE EXCAVATOR DRIVER WAS BROUGHT IN FOR QUESTIONING  FAMILY MEMBERS TOLD FOREIGN BASED SATELLITE CHANNELS  SOME PEOPLE EVEN SAID HE HAD BEEN ARRESTED  BUT THIS COULD NOT BE INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED IMAGEREZA SHAH PAHLAVI  WHO BECAME SHAH IN 1925 CREDITASSOCIATED PRESSTHE EXCITEMENT BUILT AS NEWS OF THE MUMMY SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY  BECOMING A POPULAR RALLYING POINT AGAINST IRANS CLERICAL GOVERNMENT AND QUICKLY SETTING OFF ALARMS IN HIGH PLACES  PEOPLE STARTED GATHERING AT THE SHRINE  CALLING OUT FOR REZA SHAH  ONE VIDEO SHOWS SUPPORTERS OF THE TEHRAN SOCCER CLUB PERSEPOLIS SHOUTING  LONG LIVE REZA SHAH DURING A GAME PERSIAN LANGUAGE SATELLITE

IS REZA SHAH  NO DOUBT  SAID AKBAR  WHO WAS SELLING ISLAMIC JEWELRY IN THE BAZAAR NEAR THE SHRINE AND WHO REFUSED TO GIVE HIS FAMILY NAME TO AN INQUISITIVE FOREIGNER WHOSE INTENTIONS WERE UNCLEAR  WE IRANIANS ARE SUPERSTITIOUS  AND I PERSONALLY BELIEVE HIS RETURN IS A MESSAGE  THAT MESSAGE IS  CORRECT THE MESS  IN RECENT MONTHS  IRAN HAS HAD PROTESTS OVER THE LAGGING ECONOMY AND AGAINST COMPULSORY ISLAMIC HEAD SCARVES  AT THE SAME TIME  PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS HINTED HE WANTS TO REVISIT THE IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT  WHICH MANY IRANIANS HAD HOPED WOULD PUT THE COUNTRY ON A NORMAL PATH INSTEAD  IRANIANS ARE CAUGHT IN A SEEMINGLY PERPETUAL LIMBO  THERE IS NOSTALGIA FOR THE DAYS BEFORE THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION  WHEN PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER CAME TO IRAN TO MEET WITH SHAH MOHAMMED REZA PAHLAVI  THE SON OF REZA SHAH  INSTEAD OF WEAPONS EXPERTS HAGGLING OVER NUCLEAR CENTRIFUGES  OF COURSE  THERE IS ALSO A BIT OF AMNESIA ABOUT THE SHAHS DESPOTIC TENDENCIES  AND THE ABUSES BY HIS SECRET POLICE  THE SAVAK  WHICH FUELED THE UPRISING THAT OVERTHREW HIM IN 1979 WHILE THE AUTHORITIES REFUSED TO SAY WHETHER THE RECENT DISCOVERY WAS  IN FACT  THE MUMMIFIED REMAINS OF REZA SHAH  MANY IRANIANS TOOK THE OFFICIAL RELUCTANCE  THE LOCATION OF THE FIND AND THE VIRTUAL ABSENCE OF MUMMIES IN THE COUNTRY AS PROOF POSITIVE IT HAS TO BE HIM  MY IRANIAN MOTHER IN LAW CRIED OUT DURING A DEBATE AT THE KITCHEN TABLE  WE IRANIANS DONT DO MUMMIES THEIR REASONING WENT LIKE THIS  WHEN MOHAMMED REZA PAHLAVI AND HIS FAMILY HURRIEDLY LEFT IRAN ON A SUNNY JANUARY DAY IN 1979 AS THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION WAS GATHERING FORCE  THEY LEFT BEHIND TWO LONG DECEASED RELATIVES  ONE  HIS BROTHER  PRINCE ALIREZA PAHLAVI  DIED IN 1954 IN A PLANE CRASH IN THE SNOWY ALBORZ MOUNTAINS OF IRAN AND WAS BURIED AT AN UNKNOWN LOCATION BUT THE GRAVE SITE OF HIS FATHER  REZA SHAH  WHO DIED IN 1944  WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD TO MISS  AN IMPOSING MAUSOLEUM ADJACENT TO THE PARROT GARDEN WHERE THE EXCAVATOR WAS DIGGING LAST MONTH REZA SHAH RULED FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES  MANY HERE CALL HIM THE FATHER OF MODERN IRAN  FOR SINGLE HANDEDLY CARRYING A BACKWARD  MOSQUITO INFESTED COUNTRY INTO THE 20TH CENTURY  HE WENT INTO EXILE IN SOUTH AFRICA AFTER BEING FORCED BY THE BRITISH AND SOVIETS TO ABDICATE IN 1941 IN FAVOR OF HIS SON AFTER HIS DEATH IN JOHANNESBURG IN 1944  HIS BODY WAS TAKEN TO EGYPT  WHERE IT WAS MUMMIFIED AND WHERE IT STAYED UNTIL 1950  WHEN HIS REMAINS WERE BROUGHT BACK TO IRAN THE MAUSOLEUM WHERE REZA SHAH WAS LAID TO REST WAS INSPIRED BY NAPOLEONS IN PARIS  OVER 80 FEET HIGH  IT RIVALS IN SIZE THE SHRINE TO ABDOL AZIM  BUT AFTER THE REVOLUTION  THE FIREBRAND CLERIC SADEGH KHALKHALI  KNOWN AS THE HANGING JUDGE FOR ORDERING THE EXECUTION OF HUNDREDS  HAD THE MAUSOLEUM TORN DOWN  REZA SHAHS BODY WAS SOMEHOW LOST I REMEMBER WHEN THE REVOLUTIONARIES STARTED DEMOLISHING THE MAUSOLEUM  SAID ALI ZAKERI  72  WHO SPENDS MOST OF HIS DAYS IN THE BAZAAR SURROUNDING THE SHAH ABDOL AZIM SHRINE  IT WAS BUILT SO STRONG THAT AFTER A WHOLE DAY OF HAMMERING  THEY ONLY MANAGED TO TAKE THREE CENTIMETERS OFF  HE ADDED  REFERRING TO A BIT MORE THAN AN INCH IT WAS A SUNNY SPRING DAY  AND MR  ZAKERI AND HIS FRIEND WERE DISCUSSING THE ENHANCED POLICE PRESENCE THAT HAD ACCOMPANIED THE CROWDS SWARMING THE NORMALLY PEACEFUL AREA AROUND THE SHRINE  HOPING TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE MUMMY WHEN I SAW THE MUMMY  I KNEW THIS WAS REZA SHAH  SAID THE FRIEND  FARMAN HEMATI  OF THE PHOTOGRAPH THAT HAD CIRCULATED ON SOCIAL MEDIA  HE WAS SITTING NEXT TO A SCALE LIKE THOSE IN OLD FASHIONED ARCADES  WHERE PEOPLE COULD WEIGH THEMSELVES FOR THE EQUIVALENT OF 5 CENTS  ALTHOUGH VERY FEW DID HE THEN PROFFERED A THEORY AS TO WHY THE MUMMY HAD GENERATED SUCH EXCITEMENT I LOST MOST OF MY MONEY AFTER THE REVOLUTION  HE SAID  ADDING THAT THINGS IN IRAN HAD SINCE GONE DOWNHILL  WE NEED A STRONG LEADER  TO SET THINGS STRAIGHT HERE  SOMEONE LIKE REZA SHAH  THE DISCOVERY OF HIS BODY IS A SIGN THAT CHANGE IS COMING FOR IRANS AUTHORITIES  ONE THING WAS CLEAR  THE MUMMY  REGARDLESS OF WHO WAS WRAPPED INSIDE  COULDNT BE IN THE PUBLIC EYE MEASURES WERE TAKEN  PLAINCLOTHES OFFICERS STARTED ROAMING THE SHRINE  SEEKING OUT REZA SHAH AFICIONADOS AND SENDING THEM HOME  ONE RECENT EVENING  AFTER A LARGE GROUP GATHERED  SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED  THE CONSTRUCTION SITE WHERE THE MUMMY WAS FOUND HAS BEEN CORDONED OFF AND THE EXCAVATOR DRIVER

WHETHER THEY REALIZE IT OR NOT  EXPERTS SAY THEY APPEAR TO HAVE ADMITTED THAT TRUMP AND COHEN BROKE THE LAW  THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE IMPUNITY THAT TRUMP HAS ENJOYED SO FAR WILL HOLD OR WHETHER

20180503,politics,trump,3,TEHRAN  DEEP IN THE PIT  LIBERATED FROM ITS TOMB BENEATH A THICK SLAB OF CONCRETE  LAY A MUD COLORED MUMMY  IT WAS DISCOVERED NEAR THE SHRINE TO A SHIITE SAINT  SHAH ABDOL AZIM  WHERE KINGS AND NOBLEMEN HAVE BEEN LAID TO REST  AN EXCAVATOR WORKING NEARBY SUDDENLY FELL SILENT  AND WORKERS COULD BE HEARD CRYING OUT IN AMAZEMENT HAD THIS BEEN CAIRO  IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE MERITED A MENTION IN THE LOCAL NEWS MEDIA  BUT WHILE EGYPT IS KNOWN FOR ITS MUMMIES  IRAN CERTAINLY IS NOT  HERE  THE DEAD ARE BURIED IN LOOSE WHITE CLOTH  AND THE BODIES QUICKLY DECOMPOSE THE OPERATOR OF THE EXCAVATOR SNAPPED A SELFIE WITH THE MUMMIFIED CORPSE LAST MONTH AND POSTED IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA  WHERE IT SPAWNED AN ENTICING THEORY THAT SPREAD WIDELY  THE REMAINS MUST BE THOSE OF REZA SHAH PAHLAVI  THE COSSACK BRIGADE OFFICER WHOM THE BRITISH HELPED INSTALL AS SHAH IN 1925  BEGINNING A FAMILY DYNASTY THAT LASTED 54 YEARS THE EXCAVATOR DRIVER WAS BROUGHT IN FOR QUESTIONING  FAMILY MEMBERS TOLD FOREIGN BASED SATELLITE CHANNELS  SOME PEOPLE EVEN SAID HE HAD BEEN ARRESTED  BUT THIS COULD NOT BE INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED IMAGEREZA SHAH PAHLAVI  WHO BECAME SHAH IN 1925 CREDITASSOCIATED PRESSTHE EXCITEMENT BUILT AS NEWS OF THE MUMMY SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY  BECOMING A POPULAR RALLYING POINT AGAINST IRANS CLERICAL GOVERNMENT AND QUICKLY SETTING OFF ALARMS IN HIGH PLACES  PEOPLE STARTED GATHERING AT THE SHRINE  CALLING OUT FOR REZA SHAH  ONE VIDEO SHOWS SUPPORTERS OF THE TEHRAN SOCCER CLUB PERSEPOLIS SHOUTING  LONG LIVE REZA SHAH DURING A GAME PERSIAN LANGUAGE SATELLITE CHANNELS OPERATING FROM ABROAD HERALDED THE DISCOVERY OF THE MUMMY AS A SIGN THAT THE ISLAMIC REPUBLICS DAYS WERE NUMBERED  REZA SHAHS GRANDSON  THE CROWN PRINCE REZA PAHLAVI  WHO LIVES IN THE WASHINGTON SUBURBS  WROTE A STATEMENT CALLING FOR AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION  IN ALL CORNERS OF IRAN  AT SUPERMARKETS  BUS STOPS  CLINICS OR WHEREVER  THE RETURN OF THE SHAH WAS HOTLY DEBATED THIS IS REZA SHAH  NO DOUBT  SAID AKBAR  WHO WAS SELLING ISLAMIC JEWELRY IN THE BAZAAR NEAR THE SHRINE AND WHO REFUSED TO GIVE HIS FAMILY NAME TO AN INQUISITIVE FOREIGNER WHOSE INTENTIONS WERE UNCLEAR  WE IRANIANS ARE SUPERSTITIOUS  AND I PERSONALLY BELIEVE HIS RETURN IS A MESSAGE  THAT MESSAGE IS  CORRECT THE MESS  IN RECENT MONTHS  IRAN HAS HAD PROTESTS OVER THE LAGGING ECONOMY AND AGAINST COMPULSORY ISLAMIC HEAD SCARVES  AT THE SAME TIME  PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS HINTED HE WANTS TO REVISIT THE IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT  WHICH MANY IRANIANS HAD HOPED WOULD PUT THE COUNTRY ON A NORMAL PATH INSTEAD  IRANIANS ARE CAUGHT IN A SEEMINGLY PERPETUAL LIMBO  THERE IS NOSTALGIA FOR THE DAYS BEFORE THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION  WHEN PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER CAME TO IRAN TO MEET WITH SHAH MOHAMMED REZA PAHLAVI  THE SON OF REZA SHAH  INSTEAD OF WEAPONS EXPERTS HAGGLING OVER NUCLEAR CENTRIFUGES  OF COURSE  THERE IS ALSO A BIT OF AMNESIA ABOUT THE SHAHS DESPOTIC TENDENCIES  AND THE ABUSES BY HIS SECRET POLICE  THE SAVAK  WHICH FUELED THE UPRISING THAT OVERTHREW HIM IN 1979 WHILE THE AUTHORITIES REFUSED TO SAY WHETHER THE RECENT DISCOVERY WAS  IN FACT  THE MUMMIFIED REMAINS OF REZA SHAH  MANY IRANIANS TOOK THE OFFICIAL RELUCTANCE  THE LOCATION OF THE FIND AND THE VIRTUAL ABSENCE OF MUMMIES IN THE COUNTRY AS PROOF POSITIVE IT HAS TO BE HIM  MY IRANIAN MOTHER IN LAW CRIED OUT DURING A DEBATE AT THE KITCHEN TABLE  WE IRANIANS DONT DO MUMMIES THEIR REASONING WENT LIKE THIS  WHEN MOHAMMED REZA PAHLAVI AND HIS FAMILY HURRIEDLY LEFT IRAN ON A SUNNY JANUARY DAY IN 1979 AS THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION WAS GATHERING FORCE  THEY LEFT BEHIND TWO LONG DECEASED RELATIVES  ONE  HIS BROTHER  PRINCE ALIREZA PAHLAVI  DIED IN 1954 IN A PLANE CRASH IN THE SNOWY ALBORZ MOUNTAINS OF IRAN AND WAS BURIED AT AN UNKNOWN LOCATION BUT THE GRAVE SITE OF HIS FATHER  REZA SHAH  WHO DIED IN 1944  WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD TO MISS  AN IMPOSING MAUSOLEUM ADJACENT TO THE PARROT GARDEN WHERE THE EXCAVATOR WAS DIGGING LAST MONTH REZA SHAH RULED FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES  MANY HERE CALL HIM THE FATHER OF MODERN IRAN  FOR SINGLE HANDEDLY CARRYING A BACKWARD  MOSQUITO INFESTED COUNTRY INTO THE 20TH CENTURY  HE WENT INTO EXILE IN SOUTH AFRICA AFTER BEING FORCED BY THE BRITISH AND SOVIETS TO ABDICATE IN 1941 IN FAVOR OF HIS SON AFTER HIS DEATH IN JOHANNESBURG IN 1944  HIS BODY WAS TAKEN TO EGYPT  WHERE IT WAS MUMMIFIED AND WHERE IT STAYED UNTIL 1950  WHEN HIS REMAINS WERE BROUGHT BACK TO IRAN THE MAUSOLEUM WHERE REZA SHAH WAS LAID TO REST WAS INSPIRED BY NAPOLEONS IN PARIS  OVER 80 FEET HIGH  IT RIVALS IN SIZE THE SHRINE TO ABDOL AZIM  BUT AFTER THE REVOLUTION  THE FIREBRAND CLERIC SADEGH KHALKHALI  KNOWN AS THE HANGING JUDGE FOR ORDERING THE EXECUTION OF HUNDREDS  HAD THE MAUSOLEUM TORN DOWN  REZA SHAHS BODY WAS SOMEHOW LOST I REMEMBER WHEN THE REVOLUTIONARIES STARTED DEMOLISHING THE MAUSOLEUM  SAID ALI ZAKERI  72  WHO SPENDS MOST OF HIS DAYS IN THE BAZAAR SURROUNDING THE SHAH ABDOL AZIM SHRINE  IT WAS BUILT SO STRONG THAT AFTER A WHOLE DAY OF HAMMERING  THEY ONLY MANAGED TO TAKE THREE CENTIMETERS OFF  HE ADDED  REFERRING TO A BIT MORE THAN AN INCH IT WAS A SUNNY SPRING DAY  AND MR  ZAKERI AND HIS FRIEND WERE DISCUSSING THE ENHANCED POLICE PRESENCE THAT HAD ACCOMPANIED THE CROWDS SWARMING THE NORMALLY PEACEFUL AREA AROUND THE SHRINE  HOPING TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE MUMMY WHEN I SAW THE MUMMY  I KNEW THIS WAS REZA SHAH  SAID THE FRIEND  FARMAN HEMATI  OF THE PHOTOGRAPH THAT HAD CIRCULATED ON SOCIAL MEDIA  HE WAS SITTING NEXT TO A SCALE LIKE THOSE IN OLD FASHIONED ARCADES  WHERE PEOPLE COULD WEIGH THEMSELVES FOR THE EQUIVALENT OF 5 CENTS  ALTHOUGH VERY FEW DID HE THEN PROFFERED A THEORY AS TO WHY THE MUMMY HAD GENERATED SUCH EXCITEMENT I LOST MOST OF MY MONEY AFTER THE REVOLUTION  HE SAID  ADDING THAT THINGS IN IRAN HAD SINCE GONE DOWNHILL  WE NEED A STRONG LEADER  TO SET THINGS STRAIGHT HERE  SOMEONE LIKE REZA SHAH  THE DISCOVERY OF HIS BODY IS A SIGN THAT CHANGE IS COMING FOR IRANS AUTHORITIES  ONE THING WAS CLEAR  THE MUMMY  REGARDLESS OF WHO WAS WRAPPED INSIDE  COULDNT BE IN THE PUBLIC EYE MEASURES WERE TAKEN  PLAINCLOTHES OFFICERS STARTED ROAMING THE SHRINE  SEEKING OUT REZA SHAH AFICIONADOS AND SENDING THEM HOME  ONE RECENT EVENING  AFTER A LARGE GROUP GATHERED  SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED  THE CONSTRUCTION SITE WHERE THE MUMMY WAS FOUND HAS BEEN CORDONED OFF AND THE EXCAVATOR DRIVER WHO TOOK THE SELFIE WAS QUESTIONED  FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE SAID EARLY ON  HASSAN KHALILABADI  THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CULTURAL HERITAGE COMMITTEE OF THE TEHRAN CITY COUNCIL  FLOATED IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE SEMIOFFICIAL NEWS AGENCY ISNA THE IDEA THAT THE MUMMY COULD BE REZA SHAHS  BUT SUCH REMARKS FROM OFFICIALDOM QUICKLY DISAPPEARED FROM LOCAL NEWS SITES  THE MUMMY WAS REBURIED OR TAKEN AWAY  OR PERHAPS  AS ONE OFFICIAL SAID  THE WHOLE THING WAS PHOTOSHOPPED  FROM AN OFFICIAL PERSPECTIVE  IT NEVER HAPPENED IN A NEARBY TEAHOUSE  TWO MEN  ALI AND ARASH  WERE SUCKING ON A WATER PIPE  AS STATE TELEVISION DRONED ON BEHIND THEM  ALI SAID HE WAS A REPRESENTATIVE FOR A CONDOM BRAND  WHILE ARASH SOLD BABY CLOTHES  IT WAS 11 A M  BUT THEY WERE BOTH ALREADY TIRED MANY THINGS IN THE COUNTRY ARE WRONG  SAID

PAYING THE MONEY INTO AN ESCROW ACCOUNT  BUT BOTH THE COMPANY AND IRELAND HAVE APPEALED THE DECISION  THEY SAY IT IGNORES HOW MUCH TAX APPLE HAS ALREADY PAID TO IRELAND  MISREPRESENTS THE TAX RATE THE

PERIL FOR KNOWING AND WILLFUL VIOLATIONS OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAW RELATED TO HUSH MONEY PAYMENTS PAUL SEAMUS RYAN  VICE PRESIDENT FOR POLICY AND LITIGATION AT COMMON CAUSE  SAID THE LATEST EXPLANATION OF THE PAYMENT  THAT MR  TRUMP REIMBURSED MR  COHEN  DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE PAYMENT VIOLATED CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS A LOT OF CONTRADICTIONS COMING OUT OF TEAM TRUMP THIS MORNING  MR  RYAN SAID IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE NEW YORK TIMES THIS PAYMENT WAS TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION  HE ADDED  AND HE SAID NEW DETAILS ABOUT THE PAYMENT AND REPAYMENT COULD RAISE ADDITIONAL LEGAL PROBLEMS BECAUSE IT MIGHT VIOLATE CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS ABOUT STRAW DONORS THAT PROHIBIT MAKING A DONATION IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON MR  TRUMP HAS MADE CHANGES RECENTLY TO HIS LEGAL TEAM  AS THE

20180503,politics,politics,1,WASHINGTON  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS ISSUED DIRECTIVES TO ADDRESS SEXUAL HARASSMENT  BUT CRITICS SAY THE NEW RULES COULD BE UNEVENLY APPLIED ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT  LEAVING SOME EMPLOYEES UNPROTECTED THE NEW POLICIES  SENT TO DIVISION HEADS ON WEDNESDAY  WERE DRAFTED IN RESPONSE TO A 48 PAGE REPORT ISSUED LAST YEAR BY MICHAEL E  HOROWITZ  THE DEPARTMENTS INSPECTOR GENERAL  THAT DESCRIBED HARASSMENT  ASSAULT AND SEXUAL MISCONDUCT THE DEPARTMENT WILL NOT WAIT FOR A PATTERN OF OFFENSIVE CONDUCT TO EMERGE BEFORE ADDRESSING CLAIMS OF HARASSMENT  ACCORDING TO THREE MEMOS  OBTAINED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT OUTLINE THE GUIDELINES  RATHER  THE DEPARTMENT WILL ACT BEFORE THE HARASSING CONDUCT IS SO PERVASIVE AND OFFENSIVE AS TO CONSTITUTE A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT READ THE MEMOS HERE THE DIRECTIVES  WRITTEN BY THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL  ROD J  ROSENSTEIN  AND TWO OTHER OFFICIALS IN HIS OFFICE  ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE DEPARTMENT METES OUT SERIOUS AND CONSISTENT PUNISHMENTS TO THOSE FOUND GUILTY OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT  AND THAT EACH SECTION IN THE DEPARTMENT IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR HOW IT HANDLES ACCUSATIONS OF HARASSMENT AND MISCONDUCT INDIVIDUAL UNITS MUST PUNISH PEOPLE FOUND GUILTY OF HARASSMENT IN A CONSISTENT MANNER AND TAKE MEASURES TO PROTECT ACCUSERS AS CASES ARE BEING INVESTIGATED THE POLICIES DIRECT SECTIONS TO SYSTEMATICALLY TRACK SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS  EACH ALLEGATION MUST SPECIFY THE NATURE OF THE CLAIM  WHETHER IT WAS REPORTED TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OR TO SECURITY  AND THE DISCIPLINARY ACTION TAKEN  AND THEY SAY THAT MANAGERS MUST ACCOUNT FOR SUCH ALLEGATIONS BEFORE GIVING AN EMPLOYEE AN AWARD OR OTHER PUBLIC COMMENDATION BUT THE GUIDELINES ALLOW EACH UNIT TO DECIDE HOW BEST TO ENFORCE MANY OF THE NEW DIRECTIVES  A DECISION THAT CRITICS SAY DOES NOT COMPLY WITH ONE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERALS TOP RECOMMENDATIONS OF EQUAL POLICY ENFORCEMENT ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT THE DEPARTMENTS SPRAWLING NETWORK OF PROSECUTORIAL OFFICES AND OTHER OUTPOSTS EMPLOY MORE THAN 115 000 STAFF MEMBERS  THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS ALSO HAVE DIFFERENT REPUTATIONS CONCERNING HOW THEY TREAT EMPLOYEES THERE SHOULD NOT BE DISCRETION AMONG COMPONENTS IN HOW EACH APPLIES A DIRECTIVE  SAID CATHY HARRIS  AN EMPLOYMENT LAWYER AT KATOR  PARKS  WEISER   HARRIS  YOU COULD HAVE ONE COMPONENT SAY IT WILL WAIT 30 DAYS AFTER A COMPLAINT BEFORE INVESTIGATING IT  WHEREAS ANOTHER COULD LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION WITHIN A BUSINESS DAY  WHAT WE NEED HERE IS TOP DOWN LEADERSHIP OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS  THE INSPECTOR GENERAL HAS ISSUED AT LEAST FOUR REPORTS DETAILING EPISODES OF HARASSMENT  ASSAULT AND SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AT THE DEPARTMENT  INCLUDING THE SOLICITATION OF PROSTITUTES AND EMPLOYEES ASKING COLLEAGUES TO WATCH PORNOGRAPHY IN THE MOST RECENT REPORT  ISSUED IN MAY  MR  HOROWITZ DESCRIBED INSTRUCTORS WHO HAD SLEPT WITH TRAINEES AND AN EMPLOYEE WHO HAD STALKED A COLLEAGUE  MANAGERS WERE INCONSISTENT IN HOW THEY PUNISHED WRONGDOERS  HE SAID  AND IN WHETHER THEY ENFORCED THOSE PENALTIES THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL AND HIS OFFICE HAVE BEEN SLOW TO RESPOND  MR  HOROWITZ GAVE THE DEPARTMENT 60 DAYS AFTER THAT REPORT WAS RELEASED TO INDICATE HOW IT WOULD ADDRESS HIS CONCERNS  MR  ROSENSTEIN ISSUED THE POLICIES EIGHT MONTHS AFTER THAT DEADLINE SOON AFTER THE MAY REPORT  A GROUP OF JUSTICE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES ASKED TO MEET WITH THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE  ACCORDING TO EMPLOYEES BRIEFED ON THOSE REQUESTS  IN A LETTER WRITTEN IN AUGUST  THEY SOUGHT TO BE PART OF ANY NEXT STEPS  OFFICIALS RESPONDED TO THAT LETTER IN DECEMBER OVER THE PAST YEAR  TWO WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD TO PUBLICLY ACCUSE COLLEAGUES OF RETALIATION AFTER THEY REPORTED SEXUAL HARASSMENT  A TIMES INVESTIGATION IN MARCH FOUND THAT OFFICIALS HAD IGNORED YEARS OF COMPLAINTS THAT SUPERVISORS IN THE DEATH PENALTY UNIT HAD ENGAGED IN GENDER DISCRIMINATION AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT  THE DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATED SOME OF THE ALLEGATIONS  ONE OF WHICH WAS SUPPORTED BY TEXTS AND FIRSTHAND ACCOUNTS  BUT THE MEN ARE STILL DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES THREE DAYS AFTER THE TIMES PUBLISHED ITS ARTICLE  MR  HOROWITZ MET WITH JUSTICE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES TO TALK ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT  HUNDREDS PACKED THE DEPARTMENTS GREAT HALL  FILLING SEATS AND LINING THE PERIMETER OF THE ROOM THE MODERATOR FOR THE EVENT TOLD FELLOW EMPLOYEES THAT DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS HAD RESPONDED TO THE INSPECTOR GENERALS REPORT LAST YEAR BY SAYING THAT THE EPISODES HE UNCOVERED HAD ALL OCCURRED UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION  MR  HOROWITZ SAID THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT WAS A SYSTEMIC ISSUE AND THAT HE HOPED IT WOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY NO MATTER WHOS IN CHARGE EMPLOYEES TOLD MR  HOROWITZ THAT THEY WERE FRUSTRATED THAT PEOPLE WERE RARELY FIRED AFTER BEING FOUND GUILTY OF HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT  HE REPLIED THAT PEOPLE IN THE DEPARTMENT WERE TAKING FAR MORE SERIOUSLY ISSUES THAT IN THE PAST HAD NOT  AND THAT HIS OFFICE HAD SEEN CASES THAT RESULTED IN TERMINATIONS THAT WERE NOT SURE IN THE PAST WOULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED AS TERMINATIONS MR  HOROWITZ SAID THAT THE DEPARTMENT WAS LIKELY TO ENFORCE MORE SEVERE PUNISHMENTS AS IT TOOK HARASSMENT MORE SERIOUSLY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS NEW POLICIES MAKE EXPLICIT THAT SUBSTANTIATED SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASES SHOULD RESULT IN A PENALTY RANGING FROM A 15 DAY SUSPENSION TO REMOVAL BUT MR  HOROWITZ WARNED AT THE MEETING THAT THE DEPARTMENT COULD FACE OTHER CHALLENGES AS IT BECAME MORE WILING TO ISSUE HARSHER PENALTIES  INDIVIDUALS FOUND GUILTY OF WRONGDOING OFTEN CHALLENGE SOME OF THE HARSHER  YOU KNOW STRONGER PENALTIES  HE SAID THAT IN THE PAST  THEIR PUNISHMENTS HAVE BEEN SOFTENED AFTER THEY PUSHED BACK IF YOU HAVE ZERO TOLERANCE  HOW CAN YOU PERMIT PEOPLE FOUND TO HAVE COMMITTED MORE EGREGIOUS ACTS OF HARASSMENT OR ASSAULT TO CONTINUE TO WORK AND WALK THE HALLS  SAID MS  HARRIS  THE LAWYER  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS A VERY PRESTIGIOUS PLACE TO WORK  THEY CAN ENFORCE TRUE ZERO TOLERANCE AND FIRE PEOPLE  WHICH IS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CORPORATE AMERICA RIGHT NOW AT THE DEATH PENALTY UNIT  THE DEPUTY SUPERVISOR THERE WAS ACCUSED OF GROPING HIS ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT AT A RESTAURANT  TRYING TO PERSUADE HER TO CHECK INTO A HOTEL AND SENDING HER TEXTS OFFERING TO GIVE HER MONEY OR TAKE HER ON A TRIP  COLLEAGUES WHO HAD WITNESSED THE EPISODE AT THE RESTAURANT AND READ THE TEXTS TOLD MANAGERS AND THE INSPECTOR GENERAL  THAT SUPERVISOR STILL WORKS AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND IS APPEALING THE DEPARTMENTS DECISION TO MOVE HIM TO A DIFFERENT UNIT THE QUESTION THIS RAISES IS WHO DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE PRIORITIZE  MS  HARRIS SAID  RIGHT NOW  THEYRE WORRIED ABOUT BEING SUED BY HARASSERS  THEY SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT BEING SUED BY THE VICTIMS WHOSE CLAIMS ARE IGNORED  THAT WILL BE MUCH MORE DAMAGING TO THE DEPARTMENTS REPUTATION

20180501,business,market,10,WASHINGTON  IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE  IN APRIL  CHINA IS SAID TO HAVE TESTED AN INVISIBILITY CLOAK THAT WOULD ALLOW ORDINARY FIGHTER JETS TO SUDDENLY VANISH FROM RADAR SCREENS THIS ADVANCEMENT  WHICH COULD PROVE TO BE A CRITICAL INTELLIGENCE BREAKTHROUGH  IS ONE THAT AMERICAN OFFICIALS FEAR CHINA MAY HAVE GAINED IN PART FROM A CHINESE RESEARCHER WHO ROUSED SUSPICIONS WHILE WORKING ON A SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY AT A DUKE UNIVERSITY LABORATORY IN 2008  THE RESEARCHER  WHO WAS INVESTIGATED BY THE F B I  BUT NEVER CHARGED WITH A CRIME  ULTIMATELY RETURNED TO CHINA  BECAME A BILLIONAIRE AND OPENED A THRIVING RESEARCH INSTITUTE THAT WORKED ON SOME PROJECTS RELATED TO THOSE HE STUDIED AT DUKE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION  CONCERNED ABOUT CHINAS GROWING TECHNOLOGICAL PROWESS  IS CONSIDERING STRICT MEASURES TO BLOCK CHINESE CITIZENS FROM PERFORMING SENSITIVE RESEARCH AT AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES AND RESEARCH INSTITUTES OVER FEARS THEY MAY BE ACQUIRING INTELLECTUAL SECRETS  ACCORDING TO PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE DELIBERATIONS THE WHITE HOUSE IS DISCUSSING WHETHER TO LIMIT THE ACCESS OF CHINESE CITIZENS TO THE UNITED STATES  INCLUDING RESTRICTING CERTAIN TYPES OF VISAS AVAILABLE TO THEM AND GREATLY EXPANDING RULES PERTAINING TO CHINESE RESEARCHERS WHO WORK ON PROJECTS WITH MILITARY OR INTELLIGENCE VALUE AT AMERICAN COMPANIES AND UNIVERSITIES  THE EXACT TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ARE UNCLEAR  BUT THE MEASURES COULD CLAMP DOWN ON COLLABORATION IN ADVANCED MATERIALS  SOFTWARE AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES AT THE HEART OF BEIJINGS PLAN TO DOMINATE CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGIES LIKE ADVANCED MICROCHIPS  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND ELECTRIC CARS  KNOWN AS MADE IN CHINA 2025 THE POTENTIAL CURBS ARE PART OF A BROAD SET OF MEASURES THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS ARE NECESSARY TO COMBAT A GROWING NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT FROM CHINA  WHICH IT HAS ACCUSED OF  PRESSURING OR COERCING AMERICAN COMPANIES INTO HANDING OVER VALUABLE TRADE SECRETS  BUT BLOCKING CHINESE CITIZENS ACCESS TO AMERICAN LABORATORIES OVER FEARS OF SPYING WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT ESCALATION IN AN EMERGING COLD WAR WITH THE CHINESE OVER WHICH NATION WILL CLAIM TECHNOLOGICAL DOMINANCE THE DETAILS ARE STILL UNDER DISCUSSION AND IT IS NOT KNOWN HOW MANY PEOPLE COULD BE AFFECTED  BUT RESTRICTIONS WOULD PROBABLY FALL MOST HEAVILY ON GRADUATE STUDENTS  POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS AND EMPLOYEES OF TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES ON TEMPORARY VISAS  MORE THAN ONE MILLION FOREIGN STUDENTS STUDY IN THE UNITED STATES EACH YEAR  WITH ROUGHLY ONE THIRD COMING FROM CHINA THE RESTRICTIONS WOULD COVER CHINESE NATIONALS  BUT WITH TWO EXCEPTIONS  THOSE WITH GREEN CARDS  WHICH GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO PERMANENT RESIDENCY IN THE UNITED STATES  AND THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN GRANTED ASYLUM BECAUSE OF PERSECUTION IN THEIR HOME COUNTRY  ALSO EXEMPT WOULD BE FORMER CHINESE NATIONALS WHO RENOUNCE THEIR CITIZENSHIP AND BECOME NATURALIZED AMERICANS AN ATTEMPT TO CRACK DOWN ON CHINESE CITIZENS COULD FURTHER CHILL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS  WHOSE CLOSELY INTEGRATED MARKETS SUPPORT THE MOST PROMINENT COMPANIES AROUND THE GLOBE  TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES LIKE APPLE  QUALCOMM  IBM AND GENERAL ELECTRIC HAVE HITCHED THEIR FUTURE GROWTH TO ACCESS TO THE CHINESE MARKET  WHICH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS NOW THREATENING TO CURTAIL THIS WEEK  A DELEGATION OF ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS  INCLUDING THE TREASURY SECRETARY  STEVEN MNUCHIN  WILL HEAD TO CHINA FOR DISCUSSIONS TO HELP AVOID A BREWING TRADE WAR  BUT ADDITIONAL CURBS ON CHINESE CITIZENS COULD MAKE THOSE TOUGH DISCUSSIONS EVEN HARDER PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS THREATENED TARIFFS ON ROUGHLY  BILLION OF CHINESE GOODS IN RETALIATION FOR UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES  A PROPOSAL THAT SPARKED TARIFF THREATS OF CHINAS OWN  THE ADMINISTRATION IS EXPECTED TO DETAIL NEW PLANS FOR RESTRICTIONS ON CHINESE INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES BY THE END OF MAY  CONGRESS IS ALSO CONSIDERING GIVING THE UNITED STATES BROADER AUTHORITY TO RESTRICT CHINESE INVESTMENTS THESE MEASURES COULD PROMPT MORE DAMAGING RETALIATION FROM CHINA  WHICH HAS ALREADY PROMISED TO PLACE TARIFFS ON AT LEAST  BILLION OF AMERICAN PRODUCTS  THEY ALSO APPEAR TO BE FUELING ANTI AMERICAN SENTIMENT WITHIN CHINESE BORDERS  CHINA HAS TIGHTENED MEASURES AGAINST POSSIBLE SPYING  EVEN POSTING PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS IN SUBWAY TRAINS WARNING CITIZENS TO WATCH FOREIGNERS FOR SIGNS OF ESPIONAGE IN AMERICA  RESEARCH INSTITUTES LOOK PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO ESPIONAGE  ACCORDING TO DEFENSE DEPARTMENT STATISTICS  NEARLY A QUARTER OF ALL FOREIGN EFFORTS TO OBTAIN SENSITIVE OR CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IN 2014 WERE ROUTED THROUGH ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS  AT A CONGRESSIONAL HEARING IN APRIL  MICHELLE VAN CLEAVE  A FORMER NATIONAL COUNTERINTELLIGENCE EXECUTIVE  SAID THE FREEDOM AND OPENNESS OF THE UNITED STATES MADE THE COUNTRY A SPYS PARADISE  CHINESE AND RUSSIAN AGENTS BOTH COME TO THE UNITED STATES WITH DETAILED SHOPPING LISTS  SHE ADDED YET THROWING UP BARRIERS TO PROTECT AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY COULD COME AT A HIGH COST  RESTRICTING THE FREE FLOW OF PEOPLE AND INFORMATION COULD DISRUPT INNOVATION AT AMERICAN LABORATORIES  A KEY DESTINATION FOR TALENTED RESEARCHERS FROM AROUND THE GLOBE  IT COULD THREATEN THE SUBSTANTIAL PROFITS THAT AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES EARN FROM FOREIGN STUDENTS  WHO OFTEN PAY FULL TUITION AND IT COULD LEAD TO DISCRIMINATION  SOME FEAR THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATIONS COMPREHENSIVE CHALLENGE TO CHINA  ALWAYS AN EASY POLITICAL TARGET IN THE UNITED STATES  IS CULTIVATING A XENOPHOBIC  COLD WAR MENTALITY IN WASHINGTON THAT CASTS ALL CHINESE PEOPLE AS ENEMIES THE COMMITTEE OF 100  A GROUP OF PROMINENT CHINESE AMERICANS  HAS DENOUNCED GOVERNMENT ASSERTIONS THAT CHINESE PROFESSORS  SCIENTISTS AND STUDENTS IN THE UNITED STATES MAY BE GATHERING INTELLIGENCE FOR THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AS DISTURBING AND PREJUDICIAL AND WARNED THAT IT HAS OVERTONES OF ANTI JAPANESE SENTIMENT THAT WAS RAMPANT DURING WORLD WAR II TO TARGET A WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE AS BEING SUBJECT TO GREATER SUSPICION  BASED PURELY ON RACE AND NATIONAL ORIGIN  AND IN ADVANCE OF ANY FACTS OR EVIDENCE  GOES AGAINST THE FUNDAMENTAL AMERICAN IDEALS OF THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE  DUE PROCESS AND EQUAL PROTECTION FOR ALL  IT ALSO FANS THE FLAMES OF HYSTERIA  THE GROUP SAID IN A STATEMENT ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN DEBATING RESTRICTING VISAS OFFERED TO CHINESE NATIONALS FOR MONTHS AS PART OF THE BROAD PACKAGE OF MEASURES TARGETING CHINA ECONOMICALLY  BUT THE NEW PLAN UNDER DISCUSSION BY THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD BE A MUCH MORE TARGETED MEASURE  AND ONE WITH POTENTIALLY BIG CONSEQUENCES FOR AMERICAN INDUSTRY  WHILE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ALSO PROPOSED BARRING FOREIGN STUDENTS FROM COMPANY SPONSORED RESEARCH AT AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES WITH NATIONAL SECURITY IMPLICATIONS  THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATIONS MEASURES COULD APPLY MORE BROADLY TO PRIVATE RESEARCH FACILITIES AS WELL AS NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES THE UNITED STATES ALREADY RESTRICTS WHO CAN WORK ON SENSITIVE TECHNOLOGY  RESEARCHERS ON PROJECTS DEEMED CLASSIFIED ARE CAREFULLY VETTED AND MUST OBTAIN SECURITY CLEARANCES  THE NEXT LEVEL DOWN ARE RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO SO CALLED EXPORT CONTROLS  INCLUDING MANY WITH POTENTIAL MILITARY APPLICATIONS  SUCH AS COMPUTER PROGRAMS AND HARDWARE THAT MIGHT BE USED TO MODEL NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS  UNIVERSITIES AND COMPANIES WORKING ON THIS MATERIAL NEED TO OBTAIN A SPECIAL LICENSE FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO EMPLOY FOREIGN RESEARCHERS THESE PRODUCTS DO NOT NEED TO LEAVE THE UNITED STATES TO FALL UNDER EXPORT RULES  ALL IT TAKES TO TRIGGER EXPORT CONTROLS IS FOR CITIZENS FROM CERTAIN COUNTRIES  INCLUDING CHINA  RUSSIA AND MANY FORMER SOVIET REPUBLICS  TO BE INVOLVED IN ALMOST ANY WAY  THAT RANGES FROM PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF THE PRODUCT TO WRITTEN DESCRIPTIONS AND EVEN VERBAL DISCUSSIONS OF IT  THE ADMINISTRATION IS CONSIDERING BROADENING THE RANGE OF GOODS AND SERVICES TRADED WITH CHINA THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THESE SO CALLED DEEMED EXPORT RULES IF THE PROPOSAL IS APPROVED BY THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT  AND ULTIMATELY BY MR  TRUMP  AMERICAN COMPANIES AND UNIVERSITIES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN SPECIAL LICENSES FOR CHINESE NATIONALS WHO HAVE ANY CONTACT WHATSOEVER WITH A MUCH WIDER RANGE OF GOODS  MAKING IT HARDER FOR CHINESE CITIZENS TO WORK ON A RANGE OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS FUELING THE PUSH ARE INSTANCES LIKE THE ONE INVOLVING RUOPENG LIU  A CHINESE CITIZEN AND A PROMISING STUDENT AT DUKE WHO WAS HELPING TO DEVELOP A CLOAK THAT SHIELDS OBJECTS FROM A BROAD SPECTRUM OF WAVE FREQUENCIES  THE PROFESSOR LEADING THE PENTAGON FUNDED LAB  DAVID R  SMITH  BECAME SUSPICIOUS OF MR  LIU  WHO SEEMED INTENT ON COLLABORATING WITH OLD COLLEAGUES IN CHINA  AND EVEN INVITED THEM TO TOUR THE LAB AND PHOTOGRAPH DUKES EQUIPMENT IT BECAME CLEAR TO MR  SMITH THAT MR  LIU WAS TRYING TO SHARE THE CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY HE WAS STUDYING IN THE UNITED STATES WITH COLLEAGUES IN CHINA  THE INSTITUTE HE FOUNDED ON HIS RETURN TO CHINA EVENTUALLY RECEIVED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT  REGISTERED THOUSANDS OF PATENTS AND EVEN PLAYED HOST TO PRESIDENT XI JINPING OF CHINA MR  LIU DID NOT RESPOND TO INTERVIEW REQUESTS  BUT IN PAST INTERVIEWS  HE HAS MAINTAINED THAT HE DID NOTHING WRONG  BEYOND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF AN OPEN AND COLLABORATIVE UNIVERSITY ATMOSPHERE  LIKE MANY PROJECTS IN THE UNITED STATES  MOST OF MR  SMITHS WORK AT DUKE WAS EARLY STAGE RESEARCH THAT WAS NOT CLASSIFIED OR CATEGORIZED AS A DEEMED EXPORT DANIEL GOLDEN  WHO TELLS MR  LIUS STORY IN HIS BOOK  SPY SCHOOLS  SAID MR  LIU EXPLOITED A GRAY AREA THAT ALLOWS A LARGE AMOUNT OF SENSITIVE  TAXPAYER FUNDED TECHNOLOGY TO FLOW TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS  GLOBALIZATION HAS TRANSFORMED AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES INTO A FRONT LINE FOR ESPIONAGE  MR  GOLDEN SAID YET THE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY IS LIKELY TO PUSH BACK ON THE ADMINISTRATIONS EFFORTS OVER CONCERNS THAT TIGHTER CONTROLS ON CHINESE NATIONALS COULD HURT AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES ABILITY TO COLLABORATE ON CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH AND WIND UP BENEFITING CHINA EVEN MORE MANY STUDENTS AT GRADUATE PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE  PHYSICS  CHEMISTRY AND OTHER SCIENCES ARE FROM CHINA  IF THE UNITED STATES MAKES IT HARDER FOR AEROSPACE MANUFACTURERS  DEFENSE CONTRACTORS AND OTHERS TO EMPLOY CHINESE NATIONALS  MORE OF THESE RECENTLY TRAINED CHINESE GRADUATE STUDENTS MAY RETURN TO CHINA  TAKING THEIR SKILLS WITH THEM STEPHEN A  ORLINS  THE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON U S CHINA RELATIONS  SAID THAT RESTRICTING CHINESE RESEARCHERS WOULD BE TRAGIC FOR AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES  ITS IMPORTANT THAT WE DONT LET THE SECURITY FEARS OVERWHELM WHAT HAS MADE AMERICA GREAT  HE SAID EVEN MR  SMITH SAID HE DID NOT SUPPORT TOUGHER RESTRICTIONS ON CHINESE RESEARCHERS  INSTEAD  HE SAID  UNIVERSITIES SHOULD BETTER EDUCATE RESEARCHERS ABOUT EXISTING RULES AND WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT WITH REASONABLE SAFEGUARDS I THINK WE CAN MANAGE IT  HE SAID  IF WE WERE TO OVERREACT  I THINK IT COULD BE VERY DAMAGING TO OUR UNIVERSITIES
20180501,politics,election,3,GAIL COLLINS  BRET  WHENEVER WEIRD  CRAZY MAKING THINGS HAPPEN OVER THE WEEKEND IM COMFORTED BY THE FACT THAT AT LEAST ILL BE ABLE TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THEM FIRST  PRESIDENT TRUMPS SPEECH IN MICHIGAN  OR RANT  OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT WHEN HE IGNORES THE SCRIPT AND JUST YELLS A LOT TRUMP WENT ON AND ON ABOUT STOPPING IMMIGRATION AND BUILDING THE WALL  BUT THEN HE VEERED OFF TO ASSURE THE AUDIENCE  WHICH INCLUDED A LOT OF FARMERS  THAT THEY WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO IMPORT CHEAP FOREIGN LABOR TO PICK THEIR CROPS  AND THEN  NATURALLY  WHEN THE FROST COMES  THEY HAVE TO GO OUT SO THERE WOULD BE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE CROSSING THE BORDER EVERY SPRING  MAKING THEIR WAY TO THE UPPER MIDWEST  DOING ALL THE FARM LABOR  AND THEN PACKING UP EVERY FALL AND GOING BACK TO CENTRAL AMERICA  I GUESS ITS THE LEAST HE COULD OFFER GIVEN ALL THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS HES HAD WORKING FOR HIS OWN PROJECTS  BUT STILL  WHAT A HYPOCRITE BRET STEPHENS  IT WAS A DISGRACEFUL PERFORMANCE  THAT RALLY  THE INNUENDO ABOUT SENATOR JON TESTER OF MONTANA  I KNOW THINGS ABOUT THE SENATOR THAT I CAN SAY  TOO  THE USUAL SLURS ABOUT THE PRESS  THE CROWD SIZE FIXATION ON IMMIGRATION  IT SOUNDED LIKE TRUMP WAS PROPOSING SOMETHING LIKE THE BRACERO PROGRAM OF THE 1940S THROUGH THE EARLY 1960S  WHICH ALLOWED MEXICANS WHO WORK ON FARMS TO COME AND GO ON A SEASONAL BASIS  IT MET U S  NEEDS FOR LABOR  THE PROGRAM STARTED IN WORLD WAR II  AND OFFERED A REGULATED  SAFE WAY FOR MEXICANS TO COME AND GO ACROSS THE BORDER I WOULDNT BE AGAINST A NEW BRACERO PROGRAM IF MEXICAN WORKERS WERE TREATED FAIRLY AND IF IT WERE PART OF A PACKAGE OF REFORMS TO MAKE MIGRATION SANER  BETTER REGULATED  AND LESS REGULATED  BUT THATS NOT WHERE THIS ADMINISTRATION IS GOING  WHAT TRUMP HAS IN MIND IS THE EISENHOWER ERA OPERATION WETBACK OF MASS DEPORTATION RECEIVE THE DAYS MOST URGENT DEBATES RIGHT IN YOUR INBOX BY SUBSCRIBING TO THE OPINION TODAY NEWSLETTER GAIL  IM NOT A FAN OF A BRACERO REBOOT  BUT YOURE RIGHT  THERES NO POINT IN DISCUSSING WHETHER SOMETHING WOULD WORK IN THE CONTEXT OF SANE IMMIGRATION REFORM AT THIS POINT BRET  SPEAKING OF SPEECHES  THE ONE THAT GOT THE MOST ATTENTION RECENTLY WAS COMEDIAN MICHELLE WOLFS BARN BURNER AT THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS ASSOCIATION DINNER  SHES TAKING A LOT OF FLAK ABOUT IT  BUT I THINK SHES FUNNY AND I CANT FEEL TOO SORRY FOR SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS OR KELLYANNE CONWAY FOR FINDING THEMSELVES AT THE SHARP END OF HER ZINGERS  THEY REPRESENT A PRESIDENT WHO IS TWICE AS RUDE AND ONLY INADVERTENTLY FUNNY  WHAT DO YOU THINK GAIL  IVE NEVER LIKED THE IDEA OF JOURNALISTS AND POLITICIANS GETTING TOGETHER FOR A GALA BASH TO CELEBRATE THEIR INNER PALSHIP  LAST WEEKENDS EVENT WAS THE WORST POSSIBLE MIX  AN ABSENT PRESIDENT WHO MAKES HIS CAREER OUT OF CLAIMING THE MEDIA IS BIASED AND A BIG CHUNK OF THE WASHINGTON PRESS CORPS LAUGHING  SORT OF  WHILE A COMIC MAKES RAUCOUS JOKES ABOUT HIM AND THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR HIM I APPRECIATE WOLFS TALENT BUT GIVEN THE CONTEXT  THE WHOLE THING WAS JUST CRINGE WORTHY EXCEPT THE SHOWTIME CARTOON ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE IF TRUMP DID COME  FUN SKEWERING OF ALL SIDES AND AN EXCELLENT PICTURE OF YOU  BTW BRET  SOMEONE SENT ME THE REEL  I CRINGED GAIL  LETS TALK ABOUT SOMETHING LESS STRESSFUL  WE CONVERSE A LOT ABOUT OUR DEEP SEATED CONVICTIONS  BRET  ARE THERE SOME THINGS YOU BELIEVE IN  BUT JUST CANT GET ALL THAT EXERCISED ABOUT I DID A COLUMN LAST WEEK ABOUT PAUL RYAN FIRING THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES CHAPLAIN  WHICH I SAW AS ANOTHER LESSON IN THE OVERALL AWFULNESS OF OUR CURRENT SPEAKER  BUT A NUMBER OF READERS WROTE TO ARGUE THAT THERE ACTUALLY SHOULDNT BE A CHAPLAIN TO BEGIN WITH  THAT THE IDEA OF EMPLOYING A PRIEST OR MINISTER OR RABBI TO LEAD CONGRESS IN PRAYER WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT WHEN I WAS WRITING THE THOUGHT DEFINITELY CROSSED MY MIND  THIS IS AN INSTITUTION WE COULD DO WITHOUT  THEN I SORT OF MENTALLY SHRUGGED AND MOVED ON HOW ABOUT YOU BRET STEPHENS  I AGREE WITH YOU IN QUESTIONING THE NECESSITY FOR  AND WITH YOUR READERS IN DOUBTING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF  THAT CONGRESSIONAL CHAPLAINCY  JUST ANOTHER CASE OF BIG GOVERNMENT RUN AMOK  WHILE WERE AT IT  CAN WE ALSO GET RID OF THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE IN TOTO  AND MAYBE A GOOD CHUNK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE  ALSO  THE BUREAU OF ALCOHOL  TOBACCO AND FIREARMS COULD LOSE ITS FIRST TWO MISSIONS BUT IM GETTING CARRIED AWAY  AS FOR THINGS I CARE ABOUT  BUT NOT TOO MUCH  I CAN THINK OF A FEW  I THINK THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION IS A COLOSSAL WASTE OF MONEY BUT  HEY  ITS SORTA COOL  I THINK ITS LUDICROUS THAT THE MILITARY IS SO HEAVILY INVESTED IN FOOTBALL GAMES  BUT WHATEVER  AND  CLOSER TO HOME  I THINK BIKES ARE BECOMING A DANGER TO DRIVERS AND PEDESTRIANS ALIKE IN NEW YORK CITY  BUT IM NOT GOING TO SPEND A COLUMN ON IT  AT LEAST UNTIL IM INVOLVED IN A COLLISION GAIL  AH  YES  THE BIKE WARS  I NEVER WENT THERE EITHER I FIND THAT I BACK AWAY EVEN FROM ISSUES IM PASSIONATE ABOUT WHEN SOMEONE SUGGESTS AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION  I ENVISION A LONG  IMPOSSIBLE SLOG LIKE THE HEARTBREAKING ONE WE HAD WITH THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT IN THE 1970S AND 80S I JUST DONT BELIEVE THAT IN OUR CURRENT POLITICAL ERA  YOU CAN EVER GET 38 STATE LEGISLATURES TO AGREE ON ANYTHING MORE DIFFICULT THAN NATIONAL GOOD NEIGHBOR DAY  THERES A NEW E R A  MOVEMENT UNDERWAY NOW AND IT MAKES ME SO SAD TO SAY I THINK ITS A WASTE OF TIME ARE YOU STILL READY TO CRUSADE TO GET RID OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT BRET  YES  AND YOU OUGHT TO JOIN ME IN IT GAIL  REPEALING THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE AND TALKING ABOUT IT JUST GIVES THE N R A  ANOTHER PARANOIA POINT TO EXPLOIT  I SAY FOCUS ON THE REFORMS THAT COULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN  LIKE BANNING ASSAULT RIFLES  TIGHTENING BACKGROUND CHECKS BRET  IM A BELIEVER IN ADVOCATING SUPPOSEDLY IMPOSSIBLE IDEAS  AT LEAST EDITORIALLY  IF NOT US  WITH THE FANTASTIC FREEDOM AND REACH THAT THE TIMES GIVES US AS COLUMNISTS  THEN WHO  ANYWAY  ITS NOT AS IF THE N R A  WILL EVER LACK FOR PARANOID FANTASIES ABOUT THE DEEP STATE COMING FOR THEIR GUNS  SO  IF NOTHING ELSE  STARTING A SERIOUS MOVEMENT TO REPEAL THE SECOND AMENDMENT MIGHT SCARE THEM INTO ACCEPTING THE KIND OF SENSIBLE RESTRICTIONS YOU ADVOCATE GAIL  INSTEAD OF GIVING THE N R A  UM  AMMUNITION TO CLAIM WERE OUT TO TAKE AWAY EVERY HUNTING RIFLE  ID RATHER DEMAND THEY DEFEND TEENAGE GUN PURCHASES AND THEIR OPEN CARRY EDEN IN WHICH EVERY APPLEBEES PATRON IS PACKING HEAT BUT LET ME STOP FOR A MINUTE AND SAY THAT THIS DISCUSSION DOES HAVE ME RETHINKING THE CHAPLAIN COLUMN  I REALLY SHOULD HAVE POINTED OUT THAT ITS CRAZY FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO HIRE A MEMBER OF THE CLERGY TO LEAD CONGRESS IN PRAYER  UNLESS SOMEBODY REPEALED THE FIRST AMENDMENT WHILE I WAS DISTRACTED BRET  I USED TO THINK THAT THE LEFT WAS A LITTLE STRIDENT IN DEMANDING STRICT SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE  BUT MY VIEWS HAVE CHANGED AS IVE WATCHED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY CONSTANTLY TRY TO INJECT CHRISTIANITY INTO EVERYDAY POLITICAL LIFE  BEING JEWISH PROBABLY HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT  AND  IN TRUTH  MANY OF THE FOUNDERS WERE LUKEWARM THEISTS WITH DEEP DISTRUST OF RELIGIOUS DOGMA  THOMAS JEFFERSON WROTE HIS OWN VERSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT AND GOT RID OF ALL THE MIRACLES ANYWAY  WE DONT NEED A HOUSE CHAPLAIN SO THAT PAUL RYAN CAN FIRE HIM ON HIS OWN WAY OUT THE DOOR  AND SPEAKING OF THE HOUSE  WHATS YOUR WAGER ON IT FLIPPING IN NOVEMBER GAIL  OH  WOW  ARE YOU TAKING BETS  IF YOU TAKE THE REPUBLICANS HOLDING ON  ILL GIVE YOU 5 1  NO  10 1 BRET  NOT A BET IM GOING TO TAKE  CONSIDERING REPUBLICANS COULD BARELY HOLD ON TO TRENT FRANKSS SEAT IN ARIZONA LAST WEEK GAIL  THE REPUBLICANS REALLY THOUGHT THEY COULD RIDE TO RE ELECTION ON THOSE TAX CUTS  BUT THE PUBLIC IS MAINLY JUST SORT OF SHRUGGING WHICH TAKES US BACK TO THAT HOUSE CHAPLAIN  HE GOT IN TROUBLE FOR PRAYING THAT THE TAX BILL WOULD BE FAIR TO EVERYBODY  IF THERES REALLY REPUBLICAN RANCOR AT THE GUY  ITS BECAUSE THEYRE NOW SO SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT THEY SLASHED GOVERNMENT REVENUES  BLEW UP THE DEFICIT  AND AVERAGE VOTERS UNDERSTAND THEYRE NOT GETTING MUCH OUT OF IT BRET  IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE  BUT I SUSPECT THE REPUBLICANS WILL STILL GET SOME BENEFIT OUT OF THE TAX BILL  IN THE SENSE THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT MUCH WORSE FOR THEM ELECTORALLY IF THEY HAD FAILED TO PASS IT AND FURTHER TURNED OFF THEIR OWN BASE AS A RESULT GAIL  OH  THE BASE  DO YOU THINK WE COULD INVITE THE BASE TO LUNCH  OR OUT FOR A DRINK  TO SEE IF WE COULD ENCOURAGE THE BASE TO CHILL A LITTLE BRET  YEAH  BUT ONLY FOR LIGHT BEER WHERE I AGREE WITH YOU IS THAT THE TAX BILL SURE WASNT THE WONDER DRUG PAUL RYAN KEPT PROMISING IT WOULD BE  ECONOMIC GROWTH IS DOWN SOMEWHAT THIS QUARTER AND THE DOW IS PRETTY MUCH WHERE IT BEGAN THE YEAR  THOUGH THATS ARGUABLY DUE TO TRUMPS ATTEMPT TO START A TRADE WAR  CUTS IN PERSONAL RATES WERE MODEST  SO PEOPLE ARENT COMING OUT OF TAX SEASON FEELING RICHER AND MORE GRATEFUL  AND THOUGH I THINK IT WAS SMART TO SLASH CORPORATE TAX RATES  THE BENEFITS ARE FAIRLY ABSTRACT FROM THE VOTERS POINT OF VIEW I HAVE TO SAY  I WONT MIND AT ALL SEEING DEMOCRATS TAKE THE HOUSE  REPUBLICANS MADE THEIR PROVERBIAL BED WITH TRUMP AND NOW THEYLL GET TO LIE IN IT  AND A WAVE ELECTION FOR DEMOCRATS MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO ENCOURAGE A PRIMARY OR THIRD PARTY CHALLENGE TO TRUMP IN 2020  WHICH IS WHERE IM PINNING MOST OF MY POLITICAL HOPES THESE DAYS GAIL  WOW  WE HAVENT TALKED ABOUT YOUR 2020 DREAMS  ANYBODY IN PARTICULAR YOU HAVE IN MIND  IF YOU MENTION MITT ROMNEY I GET TO BRING UP HIS DOG BRET  LETS JUST LEAVE THE DOG ON THE CAR ROOF  SHALL WE AMONG REPUBLICANS  I WOULD LOVE TO SEE JOHN KASICH  BEN SASSE OR NIKKI HALEY CHALLENGE TRUMP IN THE PRIMARY  I THINK THEYVE ACQUITTED THEMSELVES PRETTY WELL  AND HALEY HAS PROVED HERSELF THE ONLY MEMBER OF TRUMPS CABINET WITH THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF MORAL SENSE AND SPINE ID ALSO BE HAPPY WITH MORE THAN A FEW DEMOCRATS  ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM PURPLE STATES  GOV  JOHN HICKENLOOPER OF COLORADO AND SENATOR MICHAEL BENNET  ALSO OF COLORADO  BOTH COME TO MIND   YES  THE SENATOR IS OUR BOSS JAMES BENNETS BROTHER  NO  IM NOT ANGLING FOR A RAISE I ALSO DONT THINK WE SHOULD RULE OUT A CREDIBLE THIRD PARTY BID FROM AN INDEPENDENTLY WEALTHY  CENTER OF THE ROAD FIGURE  YOU KNOW  MAYBE A THREE TERM FORMER BIG CITY MAYOR  NOT THAT I WANT TO NAME NAMES  THATS ESPECIALLY IF REPUBLICANS RENOMINATE TRUMP AND DEMOCRATS GO FOR SOMEONE IN THE BERNIE SANDERS MOLD  A THIRD PARTY CHALLENGER WHO TAKES NEW YORK  NEW JERSEY AND PERHAPS FLORIDA COULD THROW THE ELECTION TO THE HOUSE AND LEAD TO THE REVIVAL OF CENTRIST POLITICS IN THE UNITED STATES  WHICH IVE MISSED A LOT  HAVE I MENTIONED HOW MUCH GEORGE H  W  BUSH HAS GROWN IN MY ESTEEM LATELY GAIL  I HAVE A DISTINCT MEMORY OF H  W  TAKING A LOT OF HEAT FOR HIS DECISION NOT TO INVADE IRAQ AFTER KICKING SADDAM HUSSEIN OUT OF KUWAIT  IF HIS KID HAD FOLLOWED DADS EXAMPLE  IMAGINE WHAT A HAPPY PLACE WE MIGHT BE LIVING IN NOW  SO YEAH  ON H  W  I AM IN YOUR CORNER I DONT THINK WEVE EVER TALKED ABOUT THIRD PARTIES BUT NOW IM LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT

20180504,politics,politics,5,ANKARA  IRAN S HARDLINERS ARE PREPARING TO BRING PRESIDENT HASSAN ROUHANI TO HEEL IF U S  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SCRAPS TEHRAN S NUCLEAR DEAL WITH MAJOR POWERS  OFFICIALS AND ANALYSTS BELIEVE TRUMP HAS THREATENED TO ABROGATE THE 2015 AGREEMENT BY NOT EXTENDING SANCTIONS WAIVERS WHEN THEY EXPIRE ON MAY 12  IF BRITAIN  FRANCE AND GERMANY DO NOT  FIX  ITS  TERRIBLE FLAWS THIS SETS THE STAGE FOR A RESURGENCE OF POLITICAL INFIGHTING WITHIN IRAN S COMPLEX POWER STRUCTURE  IRANIAN OFFICIALS SAID  ANNULMENT OF THE ACCORD COULD TIP THE BALANCE OF POWER IN FAVOR OF HARDLINERS LOOKING TO CONSTRAIN THE RELATIVELY MODERATE ROUHANI S ABILITY TO OPEN UP TO THE WEST  WHILE THE SPOTLIGHT IS ON TRUMP S EVENTUAL DECISION THERE WILL BE A DISPLAY OF UNITY IN TEHRAN  A SENIOR IRANIAN OFFICIAL TOLD REUTERS  ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY BUT WHEN THE CRISIS IS OVER  HARDLINERS WILL TRY TO WEAKEN AND SIDELINE THE PRESIDENT  THE OFFICIAL SAID  NOR CAN THE PRESIDENT EXPECT ANY WEAKENING OF IRAN S SYSTEM OF CLERICAL RULE AS A RESULT OF THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE NUCLEAR DEAL  MEANING  ROUHANI WILL BE IN A NO WIN SITUATION  SAID A RELATIVE OF KHAMENEI  FOR ROUHANI THE STAKES ARE HIGH  IF THE DEAL FALLS APART  HE COULD BECOME POLITICALLY VULNERABLE FOR PROMOTING THE 2015 ACCORD  UNDER WHICH NON NUCLEAR SANCTIONS WERE LIFTED IN RETURN FOR TEHRAN CURBING ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM   IT WILL ALSO LEAD TO A BACKLASH AGAINST THE MODERATES AND PRO REFORMERS WHO BACKED ROUHANI S DETENTE POLICY WITH THE WEST   AND ANY HOPE FOR MODERATION AT HOME IN THE NEAR FUTURE WILL FIZZLE OUT  SAID POLITICAL ANALYST HAMID FARAHVASHIAN IT IS A DELICATE BALANCE  SUPREME LEADER AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI KNOWS THAT IRANIANS  MANY OF WHOM TOOK TO THE STREETS EARLIER THIS YEAR TO PROTEST AGAINST HIGH FOOD PRICES  CAN ONLY TAKE SO MUCH ECONOMIC PRESSURE  WEAKENEDBUT THE ESTABLISHMENT DOES NOT WANT TOO MUCH OF AN OPENING TO THE WEST  DESPITE THE LIKELY ECONOMIC BENEFITS  A WEAKENED ROUHANI  UNABLE TO PUSH SUCH POLICIES  IS LIKELY TO SERVE OUT HIS TERM  WHICH ENDS IN 2021  ANOTHER SENIOR OFFICIAL SAID   HIS REMOVAL WOULD BE A SIGN OF WEAKNESS FOR THE SYSTEM  IT WOULD HARM ITS LEGITIMACY ABROAD  THE OFFICIAL SAID   BUT HE WILL BE BLAMED AND PRESSURED FOR THE ECONOMIC MALAISE KHAMENEI GAVE GUARDED BACKING TO ROUHANI WHEN HE OPENED THE DOOR TO NUCLEAR DIPLOMACY WITH WORLD POWERS IN ORDER TO END IRAN S ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ISOLATION BUT THE SUPREME LEADER S AVERSION TO THE UNITED STATES REMAINS A FORMIDABLE BARRIER TO ANY DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION NOW  SO A TRUMP WITHDRAWAL WOULD MAKE IT HARD FOR ROUHANI TO PURSUE BETTER RELATIONS WITH THE WEST THE INTERNAL POLITICS WILL MAKE IT DIFFICULT  IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE  FOR ROUHANI TO PURSUE DETENTE WITH THE WEST AND MAKE CONCESSIONS IN RETURN FOR ECONOMIC GAINS  SAID ANOTHER IRANIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL  THE EUROPEAN SIGNATORIES OF THE DEAL HAVE TRIED TO PERSUADE TRUMP NOT ABANDON IT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO KEEP TRADING WITH IRAN DESPITE THREATS TO WALK AWAY IF TRUMP BURIES THE DEAL  SEVERAL IRANIAN OFFICIALS SAID THAT  AS LONG AS TEHRAN WAS NOT EXCLUDED FROM THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL AND TRADING SYSTEM  IT COULD CONSIDER RESPECTING THE ACCORD  GUARDSBUT MANY FOREIGN FIRMS ARE HESITANT TO INVEST IN IRAN  WORRIED BY UNILATERAL U S  SANCTIONS IMPOSED OVER HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS  TERRORISM  AND THE DOMINANT ROLE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY GUARD CORPS  IRGC  IN IRAN S ECONOMY THAT IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE ROUHANI IS EXPOSED  HE HAS SOUGHT WITHOUT MUCH SUCCESS TO CURB THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES OF THE IRGC IN ORDER TO ATTRACT FOREIGNINVESTMENT BUT UNDER THE COMMAND OF KHAMENEI  THE IRGC HAS IGNORED THE GOVERNMENT S ATTEMPTS TO LIMIT ITS INVOLVEMENT IN THE ECONOMY IF THE NUCLEAR DEAL COLLAPSES  WHAT POWER ROUHANI HAS TO LIMIT THAT INVOLVEMENT WILL DECLINE FURTHER  BOOSTING HARDLINERS WHO WANT TO SEE THE PRESIDENT S POWERS REINED IN THE IRGC HAS DONE WELL SINCE THE SANCTIONS RELATING TO THE NUCLEAR DEAL WERE LIFTED  USING FRONT COMPANIES WITH NO OBVIOUS LINK TO THE GUARD TO SERVE AS A CONDUIT FOR INVESTORS RETURNING TO IRAN IF SANCTIONS ARE REIMPOSED AS A RESULT OF THE COLLAPSE OF THE NUCLEAR DEAL  THE GUARD IS WELL PLACED TO EVADE THEM CONSIDERING THEIR VAST BUSINESS NETWORK AND POLITICAL AND MILITARY INFLUENCE  THE IRGC WILL BE BACK TO THE BUSINESS OF EVADING SANCTIONS AS THEY DID FOR YEARS IN THE PAST  SAID A WESTERN DIPLOMAT IN TEHRAN THE IRGC STEPPED IN WHEN EUROPEAN OIL COMPANIES ABANDONED ENERGY PROJECTS AFTER THE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION IMPOSED SANCTIONS IN 2012   SEPAH  THE IRGC  IS AN ASSET FOR IRAN  THEY PROTECT IRAN WHENEVER NEEDED   THEY RESCUED THE ECONOMY WHEN THE ENEMIES WANTED TO CRUSH US WITH SANCTIONS  SAID A HARDLINE POLITICIAN WHO DECLINED TO BE IDENTIFIED   IF EUROPEAN INVESTORS YIELD TO AMERICA S PRESSURE AND LEAVE IRAN  THEN SEPAH WILL TAKE OVER  HE SAID CONCERNS OVER POSSIBLE ISRAELI MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAN S NUCLEAR FACILITIES HAVE EMPOWERED THE IRGC  WHICH RUNS SECURITY AT HOME AND ABROAD BUT EXPERTS BELIEVE THAT EVEN UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF AN EMBOLDENED IRGC  HARDLINERS MIGHT HESITATE TO APPLY HARSH POLICIES  FEARING A REVIVAL OF THE ANTI GOVERNMENT PROTESTS IN JANUARY THAT SHOWED THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS VULNERABLE TO POPULAR ANGER FUELED BY ECONOMIC HARDSHIP   WRITING BY PARISA HAFEZI  EDITING BY GILES ELGOOD

20180504,politics,election,3,CELINA  OHIO  AS HE RUNS FOR THE SENATE  REPRESENTATIVE JAMES B  RENACCI IS PROMISING TO PUT OHIO FIRST  ECHOING PRESIDENT TRUMPS AMERICA FIRST SLOGAN HIS DEBUT TELEVISION AD PLACES THE PRESIDENT ONSCREEN WITHIN SECONDS  WHERE HE DECLARES OF THE CONGRESSMAN  HES BEEN BEHIND ME FROM DAY 1  AND ON SATURDAY  WHEN MR  TRUMP IS IN CLEVELAND PROMOTING DECEMBERS MAJOR TAX OVERHAUL  MR  RENACCI WILL BE RIGHT THERE WITH HIM AS HE TRIES TO UNSEAT SENATOR SHERROD BROWN  MR  RENACCI IS CLOAKING HIMSELF IN THE TRUMP AURA  HOPING THAT HE CAN REPLICATE THE SUCCESS THAT MR  TRUMP FOUND IN THIS STATE IN THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION  BUT IT IS A CLOAK THAT MAY REST UNCOMFORTABLY ON THE SHOULDERS OF AN AFFLUENT  SOFT SPOKEN BUSINESSMAN CUT FAR MORE FROM THE MOLD OF THE OLD REPUBLICAN PARTY THAN MR  TRUMPS NEW ONE AND IF MR  RENACCI CAN CLEAR THE HURDLE OF TUESDAYS REPUBLICAN SENATE PRIMARY HERE  HE WILL FACE ANOTHER  FAR HIGHER ONE IN MR  BROWN  A GRAVELLY VOICED POPULIST WHOSE LONGSTANDING SUPPORT FOR PROTECTIONIST TRADE POLICIES  INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING AND ENTITLEMENTS LIKE MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY IS MORE IN LINE WITH MR  TRUMP THAN THE JIM RENACCI WHO WAS ELECTED TO CONGRESS IN 2010 AS AN OLD LINE  SMALL GOVERNMENT CONSERVATIVE BUT AS MR  RENACCI SEES IT  AFTER HELPING TO SEND MR  TRUMP TO THE WHITE HOUSE  OHIO VOTERS NOW HAVE A CHANCE TO REMOVE ONE OF THE IMPEDIMENTS STANDING IN THE PRESIDENTS WAY BY DENYING MR  BROWN  A DEMOCRAT  FROM SERVING A THIRD TERM THE REASON WHY THE PRESIDENT ENDORSED ME AND ASKED ME TO RUN IS HE WANTS SOMEBODY WHO CAN HELP HIM GET HIS AGENDA DONE  NOT SOMEBODY WHOS GOING TO VOTE AGAINST HIM  MR  RENACCI SAID AS HE SAT IN A BOOTH AT A CHICKEN WING RESTAURANT HERE MR  RENACCI  WITH AN ESTIMATED NET WORTH OF AT LEAST  MILLION  ACCORDING TO ROLL CALL  HAS HAD A LONG AND VARIED BUSINESS CAREER  WITH INVOLVEMENT IN NURSING HOMES  HARLEY DAVIDSON DEALERSHIPS  A CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP AND PARTIAL OWNERSHIP OF AN ARENA FOOTBALL TEAM  HE HAS LENT  MILLION TO HIS SENATE CAMPAIGN  A QUIET  CASUAL DEMEANOR HELPED INGRATIATE HIM WITH WORKING CLASS VOTERS IN HIS HOUSE DISTRICT SOUTH OF CLEVELAND EVEN AS HE HELD ON TO THE TRADITIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE REPUBLICAN VOTE BUSINESSMEN AND BUSINESSWOMEN HAVE DIFFERENT STYLES  HE CONCEDED  IM MORE THE QUIET STYLE ALL OF THAT MAKES HIS EMBRACE OF MR  TRUMP AN IMPERFECT FIT  FOR ONE THING  MR  TRUMP PLEDGED TO DRAIN THE SWAMP  AND MR  RENACCI  WHO WAS FIRST ELECTED TO THE HOUSE NEARLY EIGHT YEARS AGO  IS TESTING JUST HOW LONG SOMEONE CAN BE IN WASHINGTON BEFORE BECOMING PART OF WHAT MUST BE DRAINED IN FACT  NOT TOO LONG AGO  MR  RENACCI WANTED OUT OF CONGRESS ENTIRELY  HE HAD BEEN RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR  BUT HE SWITCHED TO THE SENATE RACE AFTER JOSH MANDEL  THE REPUBLICAN STATE TREASURER  DROPPED OUT OF THE CONTEST THIS IS A GUY THAT DOESNT WORK THE ROOM  SAID DAVID B  COHEN  A POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF AKRON  ITS UNCLEAR WHETHER HE REALLY ENJOYS WHAT HE DOES FOR A LIVING RIGHT NOW IN TUESDAYS PRIMARY  MR  RENACCI FACES COMPETITION FOR TRUMP VOTERS WHO MIGHT AGAIN BE DRAWN TO SOMEONE WHO PRESENTS HIMSELF AS AN INSURGENT  HIS MAIN OPPONENT IS MIKE GIBBONS  A WEALTHY INVESTMENT BANKER WHO SPEAKS ADMIRINGLY OF MR  TRUMPS AGENDA AND RAISED MONEY FOR HIM WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IM AN OUTSIDER  AND IM BLUNT  AND I TELL THE TRUTH  MR  GIBBONS SAID AT A RALLY OUTSIDE CINCINNATI ON THURSDAY  WHERE HE APPEARED WITH SENATOR RAND PAUL  REPUBLICAN OF KENTUCKY   THE ESTABLISHMENT IS ALL BEHIND THE OTHER GUY  MR  PAUL SAID OF MR  RENACCI  NOT MEANING IT AS A COMPLIMENT IN AN INTERVIEW  MR  GIBBONS SAID MR  RENACCI SIMPLY DID NOT CONNECT WITH PEOPLE AND COULD NOT BEAT MR  BROWN  AT THE RALLY  HE WAS UNSPARING  ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I HAVE GOING FOR ME IS WHEN JIM RENACCI SPEAKS TO A GROUP  I GET MORE VOTES  HE SAID TO LAUGHS  ID LIKE TO INCREASE HIS SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS ANOTHER COMPLICATION IS THE ISSUE OF TRADE MR  BROWN VOTED AGAINST THE NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT AS A HOUSE MEMBER AND EVEN WROTE A BOOK CALLED MYTHS OF FREE TRADE  WHEN MR  TRUMP IMPOSED TARIFFS ON IMPORTED STEEL AND ALUMINUM THIS YEAR  MR  BROWN CHEERED HIM ON MR  RENACCI  BY CONTRAST  HAS VOTED FOR TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH SOUTH KOREA  COLOMBIA AND PANAMA  AND HE ALSO SUPPORTED GIVING PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA ENHANCED TRADE NEGOTIATING POWER THE TRADE ISSUE HAS BEEN DIFFICULT FOR RENACCI BECAUSE HE IS REALLY YOUR TYPICAL BIG BUSINESS REPUBLICAN  PROFESSOR COHEN SAID  TRUMPS MORE POPULIST TONE ON ISSUES LIKE TRADE DOVETAILS REALLY WELL WITH SHERROD BROWNS POSITION ON TRADE AND OTHER POPULIST ISSUES THAT BROWN HAS BEEN ADVOCATING FOR DECADES ASKED ABOUT TRADE  MR  RENACCI STRUGGLED  HE SUGGESTED THAT MR  BROWN WAS FOCUSED ON PROTECTING STEELWORKERS AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER INDUSTRIES  LIKE FARMING AND MANUFACTURING  PRECISELY THE CRITICISM LEVELED AT MR  TRUMP  HE THEN SUGGESTED THAT THE PRESIDENT IS COMING AROUND TO HIS VIEWS WHAT HES DOING IS HES LISTENING  LEARNING AND THEN HES GOING TO LEAD  SO IN THE END I THINK THE TARIFF POLICIES AND PROGRAMS WILL CHANGE  MR  RENACCI SAID OF MR  TRUMP  IN THE END  HELL GET CLOSER TO WHAT OHIO NEEDS MR  RENACCIS EMBRACE OF MR  TRUMP CARRIES AN OBVIOUS DANGER  TURNING OFF VOTERS WHO SEE A RISK THAT HE WOULD SIMPLY BE A RUBBER STAMP OUR PRESIDENTS GREAT  BUT HES NOT ALWAYS RIGHT  SAID CAROLYN ROBEY WARREN  THE PRESIDENT OF OHIO CARRY  A GUN RIGHTS GROUP THAT ENDORSED MR  GIBBONS  SHE BROUGHT UP AN EPISODE THIS YEAR WHEN MR  TRUMP MET WITH LAWMAKERS AFTER THE SCHOOL SHOOTING IN PARKLAND  FLA WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME OUT AND SAID  TAKE THE GUNS FIRST  WELL WORRY ABOUT DUE PROCESS LATER  WE WANT THE GUY THATS GOING TO SAY  HOLD ON NOW  SHE SAID  AND WERE AFRAID JIM RENACCI WILL SAY  YES  SIR MR  BROWN IS ONE OF 10 DEMOCRATIC SENATORS WHO ARE RUNNING IN NOVEMBER IN STATES WON BY MR  TRUMP  THOUGH THE OHIO RACE IS NOT GENERALLY SEEN AS ONE OF THE DEMOCRATS MOST IMPERILED SEATS IN A WESTERN OHIO COUNTY ALONG THE INDIANA BORDER THAT MR  TRUMP WON WITH 80 PERCENT OF THE VOTE  MR  RENACCI PREVIEWED IN AN INTERVIEW HOW HE PLANNED TO TURN VOTERS AGAINST MR  BROWN  HE DESCRIBED THE SENATOR AS A CAREER POLITICIAN AND SOMEONE FAR TOO LIBERAL FOR THE STATE THAT HE REPRESENTS IVE SAID ALL ALONG SHERROD PROBABLY COULD REPRESENT MASSACHUSETTS VERY WELL  HE SAID  PROBABLY REPRESENT NEW YORK  MAYBE  MAYBE EVEN CALIFORNIA  BUT HIS VOTES DONT REPRESENT OHIO PRESTON MADDOCK  A SPOKESMAN FOR THE BROWN CAMPAIGN  RESPONDED  WHILE CONGRESSMAN RENACCI FINDS NEW WAYS TO HELP HIMSELF GET AHEAD  SHERROD IS FIGHTING FOR OHIOANS EVERY DAY  INCLUDING WORKING WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION AND HIS REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE WHEN ITS BEST FOR OHIO

20180502,business,market,9,GLENDALE  ARIZ   THE LATEST WAVE OF FOREIGN WORKERS SWEEPING INTO AMERICAN JOBS BROUGHT DONATO SOBERANO FROM THE PHILIPPINES TO ARIZONA TWO YEARS AGO  HE HAD TO PAY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO A JOB BROKER AND LIVED FOR A TIME IN AN APARTMENT WITH FIVE OTHER FILIPINO WORKERS  THE LURE IS THE PAY  10 TIMES MORE THAN WHAT HE MADE DOING THE SAME WORK BACK HOME BUT MR  SOBERANO IS NOT A HOSPITALITY WORKER OR A HOME HEALTH AIDE  HE IS IN ANOTHER LINE OF WORK THAT INCREASINGLY PAYS TOO LITTLE TO ATTRACT ENOUGH AMERICANS  MR  SOBERANO IS A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER AS WALKOUTS BY TEACHERS PROTESTING LOW PAY AND EDUCATION FUNDING SHORTFALLS SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY  THE SMALL BUT GROWING MOVEMENT TO RECRUIT TEACHERS FROM OVERSEAS IS ANOTHER SIGN OF THE DIFFICULTY SOME DISTRICTS ARE HAVING PROVIDING THE BASICS TO PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS AMONG THE LATEST STATES HIT BY THE PROTESTS IS ARIZONA  WHERE TEACHER PAY IS MORE THAN  000 BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF  000 PER YEAR  THE PENDERGAST ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT  WHERE MR  SOBERANO WORKS  HAS RECRUITED MORE THAN 50 TEACHERS FROM THE PHILIPPINES SINCE 2015  THEY HOLD J 1 VISAS  WHICH ALLOW THEM TO WORK TEMPORARILY IN THE UNITED STATES  LIKE AU PAIRS OR CAMP COUNSELORS  BUT OFFER NO PATH TO CITIZENSHIP  MORE THAN 2 800 FOREIGN TEACHERS ARRIVED ON AMERICAN SOIL LAST YEAR THROUGH THE J 1  ACCORDING TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT  UP FROM ABOUT 1 200 IN 2010 IN THESE TIMES  YOU HAVE TO BE INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE IN RECRUITING  SAID PATRICIA DAVIS TUSSEY  PENDERGASTS HEAD OF HUMAN RESOURCES  WE EMBRACE DIVERSITY AND REALLY GAIN A LOT FROM THE CULTURAL EXCHANGE EXPERIENCE  OUR STUDENTS DO AS WELL THE DISTRICT  WHICH COVERS PARTS OF GLENDALE  AVONDALE AND NORTH PHOENIX  IS A HOTBED OF ACTIVISM IN THE TEACHER WALKOUT MOVEMENT  KNOWN AS  REDFORED  PICKETING EDUCATORS SAY THEY HAVE HAD TO MOVE IN WITH THEIR PARENTS  APPLY FOR FOOD STAMPS AND PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR CLASSROOM ESSENTIALS LIKE GRAPH PAPER AND SCIENCE SUPPLIES  THEY ARGUE THAT TAXES ARE TOO LOW TO ADEQUATELY FUND SCHOOLS  OR FOR TEACHERS TO SECURE A MIDDLE CLASS LIFESTYLE IN RESPONSE TO THE TEACHER WALKOUT  REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS INTRODUCED A BUDGET THAT PROVIDES NEW FUNDING FOR SALARIES AND CLASSROOMS  BUT LEADERS OF THE  REDFORED MOVEMENT SAID THE BILL FELL FAR SHORT OF THEIR DEMANDS  AND WOULD RESTORE ONLY ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE  1 BILLION IN ANNUAL CUTS THAT THEY SAY SCHOOLS HAVE WEATHERED SINCE THE LAST RECESSION READ  TEACHER STRIKES ARE ILLEGAL IN MANY OF THE WALKOUT STATES  THAT HASNT STOPPED EDUCATORS IN PENDERGAST  WHERE SALARIES OF AROUND  000 ARE A SOURCE OF PAIN AND PROTEST FOR THE DISTRICTS AMERICAN EDUCATORS  MR  SOBERANO IS THANKFUL FOR THE PAY MUCH LIKE OTHER FOREIGN WORKERS  HE WENT INTO DEBT TO FIND A JOB IN THE UNITED STATES  HE SAID HE USED SAVINGS AND A BANK LOAN TO PAY  500  ABOUT THREE YEARS WORTH OF HIS SALARY IN THE PHILIPPINES  TO PETRO FIL MANPOWER SERVICES  THAT IS A FILIPINO COMPANY OF LIGAYA AVENIDA  A CALIFORNIA BASED CONSULTANT WHO RECRUITS AND SCREENS TEACHERS FOR THE J 1 THE PAYMENT COVERED MR  SOBERANOS AIRFARE AND RENT FOR HIS FIRST FEW MONTHS IN ARIZONA  AS WELL

SACRIFICES TO LEAVE YOUR FAMILY WAY BACK HOME  MR  SOBERANO SAID  EVERY NIGHT  HE PREPARES LESSONS FOR HIS SEVENTH  AND EIGHTH GRADE SCIENCE STUDENTS  AND EVERY MORNING  HE WAKES UP AT 4 A M  TO VIDEO CHAT WITH HIS WIFE AND TWO TEENAGE DAUGHTERS  WHO ARE ENDING THEIR DAY IN MANILA  DESPITE THEIR SEPARATION  HE SAID THE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN REWARDING  TEACHING IN A DIFFERENT CULTURE  BUT ALSO  FINANCIALLY THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT RECRUIT TEACHERS LIKE MR  SOBERANO SAY THAT THEY HAVE FEW OTHER OPTIONS  BECAUSE THEY CANT FIND ENOUGH AMERICAN EDUCATORS WILLING TO WORK FOR THE PAY THATS OFFERED  THEY SAY THAT THE FOREIGN TEACHERS ARE BEING GIVEN VALUABLE OPPORTUNITIES  AND THAT AMERICAN STUDENTS ARE ENRICHED BY LEARNING FROM THEM  BUT CRITICS ARGUE THE TEACHERS ARE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF IN A PRACTICE THAT HELPS KEEP WAGES LOW AND PERPETUATES YEARSLONG AUSTERITY POLICIES READ  WHY ARE TEACHERS WALKING OUT  WHATS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A WALKOUT AND A STRIKE THOUGH J 1 TEACHERS ACCOUNT FOR ONLY A TINY SHARE OF ARIZONAS 60 000 PUBLIC SCHOOLTEACHERS  INTERNATIONAL RECRUITMENT HAS SPREAD QUICKLY IN RECENT YEARS  AS SPONSOR COMPANIES MARKET THEMSELVES TO DISTRICTS FACING SHORTAGES AND WORD SPREADS AMONG ADMINISTRATORS  ACCORDING TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT  183 ARIZONA TEACHERS WERE GRANTED NEW J 1 VISAS LAST YEAR  UP FROM 17 IN 2010 RATHER THAN INCREASE SALARIES  DISTRICTS MAY ONCE AGAIN RESORT TO RECRUITING INTERNATIONALLY AS A WAY TO SOLVE THE TEACHER SHORTAGE  RANDI WEINGARTEN  PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS  A NATIONAL TEACHERS UNION  SAID IN A STATEMENT  SHE ADDED THAT WHILE HER UNION WILL FIGHT FOR EVERYONE WORKING IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND EDUCATING OUR KIDS TO HAVE FAIR WAGES  RIGHTS AND WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEYRE FROM  THE USE OF THE J 1 VISA PROGRAM TO FILL LONG TERM SHORTAGES IS AN ABUSE OF AN EXCHANGE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS AND RESEARCHERS SAY EXPERIENCED FOREIGN EDUCATORS CAN BE A BETTER OPTION FOR STUDENTS THAN THE SUBSTITUTES WHO WOULD OTHERWISE FILL THESE POSITIONS  BUT RESEARCH IS CLEAR THAT TEACHER CHURN NEGATIVELY IMPACTS ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT  J 1 TEACHERS ARE  BECAUSE OF THE VISAS LIMITATIONS  TEMPORARY  AND WITHOUT HIGHER PAY AND REGULAR RAISES  ADMINISTRATORS IN THESE DISTRICTS SAY IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ATTRACT ENOUGH AMERICAN TEACHERS AND KEEP THEM IN THE CLASSROOM  RECRUITING IN MANILADURING THE RECESSION  DISTRICTS FOUND IT EASIER TO HIRE AMERICAN WORKERS  SINCE MORE OF THEM WERE LOOKING TO TEACH  BUT AS THE ECONOMY PICKED BACK UP  HIRING BECAME DIFFICULT IN STATES LIKE ARIZONA  WHICH HAVE PURSUED YEARS OF TAX CUTS THAT HAVE DAMPENED SCHOOL BUDGETS AND TEACHER PAY  THE PENDERGAST DISTRICT HAS LOST  6 MILLION OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS BECAUSE OF STATE AND LOCAL CUTS  ACCORDING TO ADMINISTRATORS THE SUPERINTENDENT  LILY MATOS DEBLIEUX  HAS SOUGHT PRIVATE DONATIONS TO FUND A SPANISH ENGLISH DUAL LANGUAGE PROGRAM  A MONTHLY LUNCH DISCUSSION TO HELP PARENTS NAVIGATE THEIR CHILDRENS EDUCATION AND MANY OTHER EFFORTS  WITH THE LITTLE WE HAVE  WE HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB  SHE SAID BUT HIRING REMAINS A CHALLENGE  EVEN WITH 48 J 1 VISA HOLDERS TEACHING THIS YEAR  PENDERGAST HAS STILL HAD TO RELY ON 20 LONG TERM SUBSTITUTES  SAID MS  DAVIS TUSSEY  THE CHIEF OF HUMAN RESOURCES IN ADDITION TO INTERVIEWING INTERNATIONAL CANDIDATES VIA SKYPE  DISTRICT STAFF MEMBERS HAVE TRAVELED TO MANILA SEVERAL TIMES SINCE 2015 TO INTERVIEW TEACHERS  MR  SOBERANO MET WITH THE DISTRICT THERE IN JUNE 2016  AND JUST TWO MONTHS LATER  ARRIVED IN ARIZONA TO

SENSE  MS  DAVIS TUSSEY SAID  MANY SHORT STAFFED SCHOOLS TURN TO TEACH FOR AMERICA  WHICH RECRUITS RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATES AND CAREER CHANGERS FOR TWO YEAR STINTS IN THE CLASSROOM  BUT TO HIRE A TEACH FOR AMERICA RECRUIT  WHO MAY HAVE NO TEACHING EXPERIENCE OR COURSEWORK IN EDUCATION  THE DISTRICT MUST PAY  000 PER TEACHER  IN ADDITION TO SALARIES FOR A SIMILAR AMOUNT  A SINGLE TRIP TO THE PHILIPPINES CAN NET DOZENS OF CANDIDATES  ALL OF WHOM  AS REQUIRED BY THE J 1 PROGRAM  HAVE DEGREES IN EDUCATION OR THE SUBJECTS THEY TEACH  AND AT LEAST TWO YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN A FILIPINO SCHOOL MR  SOBERANO HOLDS ONE BACHELORS DEGREE IN EDUCATION  WITH A FOCUS ON PHYSICS  AND ANOTHER IN PHILOSOPHY  HE HAS ALSO STUDIED THEOLOGY  HE HAS OVER 20 YEARS OF CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE MUKUL BAKHSHI  DIRECTOR OF THE ALLIANCE FOR ETHICAL INTERNATIONAL RECRUITMENT PRACTICES  IN PHILADELPHIA  SAID THE PHILIPPINES PURPOSEFULLY TRAINS TEACHERS  NURSES AND OTHER WORKERS IN A WAY THAT ITS EASY FOR THEM TO PASS MUSTER FROM LICENSING AUTHORITIES HERE  THEY OBVIOUSLY SPEAK ENGLISH  AND THEY ARE WILLING TO WORK  REMITTANCES FROM FOREIGN WORKERS ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 10 PERCENT OF THE PHILIPPINES GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT THE PENDERGAST DISTRICT DID NOT OWE ANY MONEY TO THE COMPANIES THAT CONNECTED IT WITH RECRUITS IN MANILA  THOSE COSTS WERE BORNE BY THE FILIPINO TEACHERS JAMES BELL  PRESIDENT OF ALLIANCE ABROAD  THE VISA SPONSOR  SAID A FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT LIKE MR  SOBERANOS IS JUST ONE OF SEVERAL MODELS THE COMPANY USES  AND THAT IN SOME CASES  SCHOOL DISTRICTS PAY VISA3 5 RENEWAL FEES  ALLIANCE ABROAD SPONSORS SEVERAL HUNDRED J 1 VISA HOLDERS EACH YEAR  ACCORDING TO MR  BELL  WORKING PRIMARILY IN ARIZONA  CALIFORNIA  NEVADA  TEXAS AND UTAH  HE SAID THE BIGGEST DEMAND WAS FOR SPECIAL

DISTRICT THE DISTRICT WORKS WITH MS  AVENIDA  THE CALIFORNIA BASED CONSULTANT  TO FIND THE TEACHERS AND INTERVIEW THEM VIA SKYPE  WE DONT PAY ANY MONEY FOR IT  MS  AMERSON SAID  THE RECRUITS PAY THE FEES MS  AVENIDA SAID HER COMPANY  WHICH USES THE NAME AVENIDA INTERNATIONAL CONSULTANTS IN THE UNITED STATES  RECRUITED 250 FILIPINO TEACHERS WITH J 1 VISAS IN 2017  ACCORDING TO STATE DEPARTMENT DATA  THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN HALF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF J 1 VISA HOLDERS WHO ARRIVED FROM THE PHILIPPINES LAST YEAR MS  AVENIDA JOINED UNION REPRESENTATIVES IN A WORKING GROUP  ASSEMBLED BY THE ALLIANCE FOR ETHICAL INTERNATIONAL RECRUITMENT PRACTICES  THAT DRAFTED A 2015 CODE OF CONDUCT FOR INTERNATIONAL TEACHER RECRUITMENT  THE CODE CALLS FOR DISTRICTS TO BEAR ALL RECRUITMENT AND LEGAL COSTS  AND FOR FOREIGN EDUCATORS NOT TO BE CHARGED MORE THAN A NOMINAL APPLICATION PROCESSING FEE  UNDER   IT HAS NOT BEEN WIDELY ADOPTED  AND MS  AVENIDA SAID SHE DISAGREED WITH THE GROUPS CONCLUSIONS SOMEBODY HAS TO FOOT THE BILL  SHE SAID  AND IN A CLIMATE OF TIGHT SCHOOL BUDGETS  THAT SOMEBODY IS THE TEACHER READ  HOW WILL THE PROTESTS AGAINST EDUCATION CUTS AFFECT THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS LESSONS AND CHALLENGESIN MR  SOBERANOS CASE  IT WAS NOT UNTIL HIS SECOND YEAR ON THE JOB THAT HE HAD PAID BACK THE MONEY HE OWED AND WAS ABLE TO BEGIN SENDING SOME HOME TO HIS FAMILY  HE HAS HAD TO LIVE AUSTERELY  IN HIS FIRST YEAR IN ARIZONA  HE SHARED AN APARTMENT WITH FIVE OTHER FILIPINO TEACHERS  AND HE NOW RENTS A ROOM IN THE HOME OF A FILIPINO AMERICAN FAMILY STILL  HE SAID HE WAS NOTHING BUT GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY  THE DISTRICT IS VERY SUPPORTIVE  HE SAID  PENDERGAST CREATED A WELCOME COMMITTEE TO ASSIST THE FILIPINO TEACHERS  AND COLLEAGUES PITCHED IN BY BUYING GROCERIES AND DRIVING THE NEWCOMERS TO WORK IN ADDITION TO FINANCIAL CHALLENGES  FOREIGN EDUCATORS FACE INSTRUCTIONAL ONES  ADMINISTRATORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO WORK WITH J 1 VISA HOLDERS SAY THE TEACHERS MUST LEARN THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENT FOR INCLUSION  WHICH REQUIRES THAT DISABLED CHILDREN BE TAUGHT ALONGSIDE NONDISABLED PEERS  IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT POSSIBLE AND CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES DIFFER ACROSS CULTURES  IN THE PHILIPPINES  THE TEACHER THERE IS REALLY AN AUTHORITY FIGURE  MR  SOBERANO SAID  ONCE I STOOD IN FRONT OF THE CLASS  EVERYBODY KEPT QUIET  THAT WASNT THE CASE IN ARIZONA ONE THING I ALSO LEARNED IS TO BE FRIENDS WITH THE STUDENTS  MR  SOBERANO ADDED  TO KNOW MORE ABOUT EACH ONE AND ESPECIALLY THEIR FAMILY  HOW ARE THEY DOING  WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THEM  I REMOVE THAT KIND OF PROBLEM STATE DEPARTMENT REGULATIONS REQUIRE J 1 TEACHERS TO ENGAGE IN CULTURAL EXCHANGE ACTIVITIES WITH THEIR STUDENTS  THE J 1 PROGRAM WAS CREATED BY THE 1961 FULBRIGHT HAYES ACT  WITH THE PURPOSE OF FOSTERING UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN NATIONS  MR  SOBERANO SAID THAT ONCE A MONTH  HE TEACHES A LESSON ON FILIPINO CULTURE  AND THAT HIS STUDENTS HAVE BEEN MOST INTERESTED IN DISCUSSING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FILIPINO AND AMERICAN EDUCATION SYSTEMS  IN THE PHILIPPINES  MR  SOBERANO TELLS THEM  SCHOOL IS STRICTER AND MORE ACADEMICALLY CHALLENGING NEW REGULATIONS FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT  WHICH WENT INTO EFFECT IN 2016  REQUIRE J 1 HOLDERS TO RETURN TO THEIR HOME COUNTRIES FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS AFTER THEIR VISAS EXPIRE BEFORE REAPPLYING  MR  SOBERANO SAID HE MAY DO THAT  BUT HIS WISH IS TO RESIDE LEGALLY IN THE UNITED STATES AND WORK LONG TERM AS A TEACHER  I WOULD LOVE TO BRING MY FAMILY HERE  HE SAID MS  WEINGARTEN  THE UNION PRESIDENT  SUGGESTED THAT THE H 1B VISA FOR HIGH SKILLED IMMIGRANTS  WHICH OFFERS A PATHWAY TOWARD PERMANENT RESIDENCE  WOULD BE A MORE APPROPRIATE VISA FOR A TEACHER LIKE MR  SOBERANO  BUT PENDERGAST AND OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS SAY LONG WAIT TIMES AND HIGH LEGAL COSTS CAN MAKE THE H 1B PROHIBITIVE  THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO TIGHTENED OVERSIGHT OF THAT PROGRAM IN DENVER PUBLIC SCHOOLS  20 BILINGUAL

20180501,business,money,3,THE DRUG KNOWN BY THE STREET NAMES ECSTASY OR MOLLY COULD BE A PROMISING TREATMENT FOR POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER  ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY RESEARCH PUBLISHED TUESDAY IN THE BRITISH JOURNAL THE LANCET PSYCHIATRY FOUND THAT AFTER TWO SESSIONS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY WITH THE PARTY DRUG  OFFICIALLY KNOWN AS MDMA  A MAJORITY OF 26 COMBAT VETERANS AND FIRST RESPONDERS WITH CHRONIC PTSD WHO HAD NOT BEEN HELPED BY TRADITIONAL METHODS SAW DRAMATIC DECREASES IN SYMPTOMS THE IMPROVEMENTS WERE SO DRAMATIC THAT 68 PERCENT OF THE PATIENTS NO LONGER MET THE CLINICAL CRITERIA FOR PTSD  PATIENTS TAKING THE DRUG ALSO EXPERIENCED DRASTIC IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP AND BECAME MORE CONSCIENTIOUS  ACCORDING TO THE STUDY THE RESULTS  WHICH MIRROR THOSE OF SIMILAR  SMALL SCALE STUDIES OF THE ILLEGAL DRUG IN RECENT YEARS  COME AS MDMA IS ABOUT TO ENTER LARGER  PHASE 3 TRIALS THIS SUMMER  BASED ON PREVIOUS RESULTS  THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION HAS GIVEN MDMA BREAKTHROUGH THERAPY STATUS  WHICH COULD SPEED APPROVAL  IF LARGE SCALE TRIALS CAN REPLICATE SAFETY AND EFFICACY RESULTS  THE DRUG COULD BE APPROVED FOR LEGAL USE BY 2021 I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO PROCESS ALL THE DARK STUFF THAT HAPPENED  NICHOLAS BLACKSTON  32  A STUDY PARTICIPANT WHO HAD BEEN A MARINE MACHINE GUNNER IN IRAQ  SAID IN AN INTERVIEW  I WAS ABLE TO FORGIVE MYSELF  IT WAS LIKE A CLEAN SWEEP BUT THE POSSIBLE LEGALIZATION OF A WIDELY ABUSED PARTY DRUG RAISES A LOT OF QUESTIONS HOW MIGHT MDMA THERAPY WORK NO ONE GOES HOME WITH A BOTTLE OF ECSTASY IF APPROVED BY THE F D A  MDMA WOULD ONLY BE ADMINISTERED BY A LICENSED THERAPIST  FIRST  A PATIENT GOES THROUGH THREE SESSIONS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY  IN THE FOURTH SESSION  THE PATIENT TAKES A PILL AFTER TAKING THE DRUG  THE PATIENT LIES ON A FUTON AMID CANDLES AND FRESH FLOWERS  LISTENING TO MUSIC  TWO THERAPISTS  ONE FEMALE  ONE MALE  SIT AT THE PATIENTS SIDE AS GUIDES  THAT SESSION LASTS EIGHT HOURS WE ENCOURAGE THEM TO SET ASIDE ALL EXPECTATION AND AGENDA AND BE OPEN  EXPERIENCES TEND TO BE VERY INDIVIDUAL  SAID DR  MICHAEL MITHOEFER  ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL RESEARCHERS THE DRUG FLOODS THE BRAIN WITH HORMONES AND NEUROTRANSMITTERS THAT EVOKE FEELINGS OF TRUST AND WELL BEING  USERS REPORT  RESEARCHERS SAY THIS ALLOWS PATIENTS TO RE EXAMINE TRAUMATIC MEMORIES IN FOLLOW UP PSYCHOTHERAPY  PATIENTS PROCESS EMOTIONS AND INSIGHTS BROUGHT UP DURING THE MDMA SESSION  THE CURRENT PROTOCOL CALLS FOR PATIENTS TO TAKE MDMA TWO OR THREE TIMES  EACH A MONTH APART  INTERSPERSED WITH PSYCHOTHERAPY THE MDMA ALONE OR THE THERAPY ALONE DONT APPEAR TO BE AS EFFECTIVE  DR  MITHOEFER SAID  THE MDMA SEEMS TO ACT AS A CATALYST THAT ALLOWS THE HEALING TO HAPPEN WHAT DO PATIENTS SAY ABOUT IT I WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO FORGIVE MYSELF  SAID NIGEL MCCOURRY  36 A MARINE VETERAN WHO WAS DEPLOYED IN 2004 TO FALLUJA  IRAQ  WHOSE EXPERIENCES MIRRORED THOSE OF THREE OTHER PATIENTS INTERVIEWED MR  MCCOURRY CAME HOME FROM WAR UNABLE TO ESCAPE SCENES OF AN EXPLOSION THAT NEARLY KILLED HIM  AND HAUNTED BY THE MEMORY OF TWO YOUNG GIRLS HE ACCIDENTALLY KILLED IN A FIRE FIGHT  HE STRUGGLED TO SLEEP  HE DRANK TO FORGET  RAGE ERODED MOST OF HIS RELATIONSHIPS HE TRIED HELP AT A VETERANS AFFAIRS HOSPITAL  BUT COULDNT LET HIS GUARD DOWN ENOUGH TO BENEFIT FROM STANDARD PSYCHOTHERAPY  A HANDFUL OF MEDICATIONS MEANT TO HELP LEFT HIM FEELING LIKE A ZOMBIE  AND HE GAVE THEM UP  HE WAS CONTEMPLATING SUICIDE WHEN HE TRIED MDMA WHEN IT KICKED IN  IT WAS LIKE AN EPIPHANY  HE SAID  I COULD SEE ALL THESE THINGS FROM COMBAT I WAS AFRAID TO LOOK AT BEFORE  AND I HAD A TOTALLY NEW PERSPECTIVE  I RELIVED THE PARTS OF ME I HAD LOST  I REALIZED I HAD VIEWED MYSELF AS A MONSTER  AND I WAS ABLE TO START TO HAVE SOME COMPASSION FOR MYSELF  IT WAS A TURNING POINT  AND FOR THE NEXT YEAR I CONTINUED TO GET BETTER THERE ARE ALSO STILL SOME CHALLENGES I HAVE TO FACE FROM TIME TO TIME RELATED TO THE PTSD  HE ADDED  BUT NOW I AM ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THEM WITHOUT GETTING STUCK BUT DOES IT ACTUALLY WORK THATS AN OPEN QUESTION LARGE SCALE TRIALS  WHICH WILL INCLUDE UP TO 300 PARTICIPANTS AT 14 SITES  MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REPLICATE THE SUCCESS OF PREVIOUS TRIALS  WHICH WERE LIMITED TO A FEW DOZEN PATIENTS  BUT SO FAR  RESULTS ARE ENCOURAGING  NEARLY ALL PATIENTS SAW CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN SYMPTOMS  AND A MAJORITY SAW SUCH DRASTIC REDUCTIONS THAT THEY NO LONGER MET THE CRITERIA FOR A PTSD DIAGNOSIS  IN THE 12 MONTHS AFTER MDMA THERAPY  PTSD SYMPTOMS GENERALLY CONTINUED TO DECREASE SIDE EFFECTS  INCLUDING ANXIETY  HEADACHE  FATIGUE  MUSCLE TENSION AND INSOMNIA  WERE GENERALLY MINOR AND LIMITED TO THE DAYS FOLLOWING THE MDMA SESSIONS OTHER RESEARCHERS  INTRIGUED BY THE RESULTS  ARE STARTING THEIR OWN STUDIES OF MDMA THERAPY  INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS SEEMS RISKY  ISNT THERE SOMETHING BETTER NOT REALLY  SAID DR  JOHN KRYSTAL  WHO HEADS THE NEUROSCIENCES DIVISION AT THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS NATIONAL CENTER FOR PTSD  HE DESCRIBED THE CURRENT LACK OF EFFECTIVE THERAPY AS A CRISIS THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE DONT HAVE MANY TREATMENTS AND WHAT WE HAVE DOESNT WORK THAT WELL  HE SAID ONLY ABOUT ONE IN THREE COMBAT VETERANS

20180503,politics,election,4,THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE HAS COME UNDER FIRE FOR INTERFERING IN A HANDFUL OF DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY RACES AROUND THE COUNTRY  IN TRYING TO CLEAR THE PRIMARY FIELD FOR THE MORE MODERATE CANDIDATE THEY THINK WILL BE THE STRONGEST IN THE GENERAL ELECTION  PARTY LEADERS HAVE DRAWN THE ANGER OF SOME PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS WHO THINK THAT THE MERE ATTEMPT TO DO SO IS CORRUPT AND UNDEMOCRATIC I BEG TO DIFFER NO OTHER POLITICAL PARTIES IN DEMOCRACIES IN THE WORLD HAVE ABDICATED THEIR LEADERSHIP ROLE AS MUCH AS AMERICAS HAVE  WEAKENING THEMSELVES AND THEIR ABILITY TO GOVERN IN THE PROCESS  PARTY LEADERS HAVE ESSENTIALLY GIVEN AWAY THE MOST IMPORTANT POWER THEY HAVE  TO DETERMINE WHO CAN RUN AND WIN UNDER THE PARTYS BANNER  THIS POWER NOW RESTS EXCLUSIVELY WITH PRIMARY VOTERS THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT THERE IS NO ROLE FOR PRIMARIES  BUT THE PENDULUM BETWEEN THE PARTYS LEADERS CHOOSING ITS CANDIDATES AND PRIMARY VOTERS CHOOSING THEM HAS SWUNG SO FAR IN THE DIRECTION OF THE VOTERS THAT EVEN THE SMALLEST  MOST MODEST EFFORTS TO INTERVENE IN NOMINATION RACES ARE DEEMED ILLEGITIMATE THE DEBATE OVER PARTY MEDDLING ERUPTED ANEW THIS WEEK WHEN THE HOUSE DEMOCRATIC WHIP  STENY HOYER  WAS SECRETLY TAPED BY LEVI TILLEMANN  A CANDIDATE IN COLORADOS SIXTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT PRIMARY  WHEN MR  TILLEMANN ASKED IF HE SHOULD STEP ASIDE FOR JASON CROW  AN ARMY VETERAN WHO MANY PEOPLE THINK IS THE STRONGER CANDIDATE  MR  HOYER AGREED THERE WERE ALSO COMPLAINTS IN FEBRUARY WHEN  THE D C C C  PAINTED LAURA MOSER  A PRIMARY CANDIDATE IN TEXAS SEVENTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT  AS A WASHINGTON INSIDER  IT WAS A HAM HANDED ATTEMPT TO PUSH HER OUT OF THE RACE  AND THE ATTENTION MAY HAVE HELPED HER SECURE A SPOT IN A RUNOFF MR  TILLEMANNS HANDING OVER OF THE TAPE TO THE PRESS SEEMS TO HAVE BACKFIRED  MELISSA BYRNE  A FORMER BERNIE SANDERS STAFF MEMBER AND LEADER IN THE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT  TWEETED HER AGREEMENT WITH MR  HOYER  CALLING MR  TILLEMANN  A GRANDSON OF FORMER REPRESENTATIVE TOM LANTOS OF CALIFORNIA  AN ENTITLED GUY EXPECTING TO GET SUPPORT BECAUSE OF FAMILY LEGACY BUT MS  BYRNE  LIKE OTHERS ON THE DEMOCRATIC LEFT  IS UNHAPPY WITH MUCH OF THE COMMITTEES INTERFERENCE  DEMOCRATIC LEADERS HAVE INTERVENED IN  BY MY COUNT  14 PRIMARY RACES  SUGGESTING  USUALLY GENTLY  THAT SOMEONE RUN FOR A DIFFERENT OFFICE OR CLEAR THE FIELD FOR A STRONGER CANDIDATE  IS THIS LEGITIMATE MY ANSWER IS AN UNQUALIFIED YES  THATS WHAT PARTY LEADERSHIP IS ALL ABOUT DEMOCRATIC LEADERS REMEMBER ALL TOO WELL THE FAILURE OF REPUBLICAN LEADERS IN 2010 TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE SENATE  IN THE 2010 MIDTERM ELECTIONS IT WAS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT WAS RIDING HIGH  FUELED BY THE ENERGY OF THE TEA PARTY MOVEMENT AND HOSTILITY TO PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMAS HEALTH CARE PLAN  THEY WON THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  BUT WHILE THEY PICKED UP SIX SEATS IN THE SENATE  THEY CAME UP SHORT OF CONTROL HAD REPUBLICAN LEADERS BEEN ABLE TO INTERVENE EFFECTIVELY IN THE PRIMARY RACES  THEY MAY VERY WELL HAVE TAKEN THE SENATE  IF NOT IN 2010  THEN IN 2012  IN DELAWARE  FOR EXAMPLE  HAD THEY BEEN ABLE TO NOMINATE FORMER GOV  MIKE CASTLE INSTEAD OF THE ACTIVIST CHRISTINE ODONNELL  THEY MIGHT HAVE TAKEN THE SEAT VACATED BY VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN  MS  ODONNELL MAY BE THE ONLY SENATE CANDIDATE EVER WHO SAID  IM NOT A WITCH  AND WHO DIDNT KNOW WHAT WAS IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT ARE PARTY LEADERS ALWAYS RIGHT  OF COURSE NOT  BUT THEY ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE ACTIVISTS WHO OFTEN DOMINATE THE PARTY PRIMARIES BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE CONCERNED WITH ELECTABILITY THAN WITH IDEOLOGICAL PURITY  PARTY LEADERS HAVE THE JOB OF WINNING NATIONALLY  DEMOCRATS ARE PAINFULLY AWARE THAT NOT ALL CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS ARE BERKELEY  CALIF  IN 2018  ROUGHLY 55 CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS ARE POTENTIAL SWING DISTRICTS  ACCORDING TO THE COOK POLITICAL REPORT A QUICK LOOK AT THOSE DISTRICTS SHOWS WHY  OF THE 14 THE D C C C  HAS INTERVENED IN  ONLY FIVE HAVE A POSITIVE DEMOCRATIC PARTISAN VOTER INDEX  A MEASURE DEVISED BY THE POLITICAL ANALYST CHARLIE COOK TO SHOW THE HISTORICAL TENDENCY OF A CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT TO VOTE FOR ONE PARTY OR THE OTHER  AND THE TILT IS SLIGHT  RANGING FROM  1 DEMOCRATIC TO  3 DEMOCRATIC  ONE DISTRICT IS EVENLY TIED THE OTHER EIGHT DISTRICTS AVERAGE ABOUT  6 REPUBLICAN  IN THOSE DISTRICTS  THE RIGHT CANDIDATE CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE LEFT WING DEMOCRATS FREQUENTLY ARGUE ABOUT THE NEED TO MOBILIZE THE BASE AS A REASON TO RUN PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATES  BUT THE STRONGEST PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC BASE CONSISTS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS  AND AMONG THE DISTRICTS THE COMMITTEE HAS INTERVENED IN  ONLY TWO HAVE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATION PERCENTAGE THAT IS IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS  THE AVERAGE IS ONLY ABOUT 7 PERCENT  THE HISPANIC POPULATION IN MANY OF THESE SWING DISTRICTS IS LARGER  AS HIGH AS 42 PERCENT  AND DEMOCRATS MAY BE COUNTING ON THEM TO VOTE DEMOCRATIC IN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT TRUMPS IMMIGRATION POLICIES IN THOSE DISTRICTS  THE NAME OF THE GAME WILL BE TO TURN OUT THE DEMOCRATIC BASE BUT ALSO TO MOVE SOME WHITE VOTERS INTO THE DEMOCRATIC COLUMN  IF EVER THERE WAS A YEAR FOR DEMOCRATS TO PULL THIS OFF  2018 IS IT  AS THE SPECIAL ELECTIONS OF MODERATES IN VIRGINIA  ALABAMA AND PENNSYLVANIA HAVE SHOWN  PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS COULD FIND THEMSELVES CELEBRATING IN NOVEMBER IF THEY LET THE PARTY LEADERS DO THEIR JOB

20180504,politics,politics,4,IN A LESSER KNOWN NOVEL  CLAUDIUS BOMBARNAC  JULES VERNE DESCRIBES THE ADVENTURES OF THE TITULAR FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT AS HE RIDES THE GRAND TRANSASIATIC RAILWAY FROM THE EUROPEAN FRONTIER TO THE CAPITAL OF THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE  A CAST OF INTERNATIONAL CHARACTERS  BY TURNS COMICAL  CURIOUS AND SHADY  ACCOMPANIES THE FRENCH REPORTER BY TRAIN FROM THE CASPIAN SEA TO PEKING  NARROWLY ESCAPING BANDITS AND DELIVERING A MYSTERIOUS CARGO WHEN FIRST PUBLISHED IN 1893  THE BOOK WAS FUTURISTIC FICTION  THERE WAS NO CONTINUOUS RAIL LINK ACROSS EURASIA  THERE STILL ISNT  BUT 125 YEARS LATER CHINA NOW ENVISIONS FINANCING AND BUILDING MULTIPLE SUCH OVERLAND ROUTES  WITH MUCH FASTER TRAINS  THATS FOR THE BELT PORTION OF WHAT IT CALLS THE ONE BELT  ONE ROAD INITIATIVE  IT IS ALSO DEVELOPING A STRING OF NEW PORTS  FROM THE SOUTH CHINA SEA THROUGH THE INDIAN OCEAN TO AFRICA AND THE MEDITERRANEAN THE NUMBER AND SCALE OF THE PROJECTS PROPOSED ARE BREATHTAKING  FAR SURPASSING EVEN THE IMAGINATION OF A SCI FI WRITER  THEY HAVE STIMULATED AWE AND  MORE OFTEN  DARK SUSPICIONS AMONG MANY FOREIGN OBSERVERS JUST AFTER VERNE WAS WRITING  CHINAS FIRST MAIN RAILWAYS WERE BEING BUILT BY WESTERN COMPANIES  FINANCED BY WESTERN LOANS TO A NEARLY BANKRUPT QING DYNASTY  WITHIN TWO DECADES  STRUGGLES OVER FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF CHINESE RAIL HAD TOUCHED OFF A REVOLUTION THAT BROUGHT DOWN THE DYNASTY IN 1912  TODAY  THE FORMER VICTIM OF WESTERN RAILWAY IMPERIALISM IS LENDING BILLIONS TO COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT ASIA  AFRICA AND EUROPE TO CONSTRUCT NOT ONLY RAILROADS BUT ALSO HIGHWAYS  PORTS  POWER PLANTS AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE CHINAS ECONOMIC PROGRESS OVER THE PAST CENTURY HAS BEEN PHENOMENAL  LIFTING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF CHINESE OUT OF POVERTY  SO WHEN THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT OFFERS TO SHARE ITS EXPERIENCE IN DEVELOPMENT  A PROMINENT THEME IN ITS OFFICIAL SPEECHES AND DOCUMENTS  IT SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY BUT THE HISTORICAL ECHOES ARE WORRISOME  ALREADY  SRI LANKA  UNABLE TO PAY BACK THE  BILLION IT OWES CHINESE STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES FOR BUILDING MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE ON ITS TERRITORY  HAS AGREED TO LEASE ITS PORT IN HAMBANTOTA TO CHINA FOR 99 YEARS  THAT IS PRECISELY THE TERM FOR WHICH ANOTHER STRATEGIC PORT  HONG KONG  WAS LEASED BY THE QING TO THE BRITISH IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT EPITOMIZE COLONIALISM SO ONE WONDERS  IS CHINA PRESENTING A NEW MODEL OF DEVELOPMENT TO A WORLD THAT COULD USE ONE  OR IS ONE BELT  ONE ROAD ITSELF THE NEW COLONIALISM BECAUSE THESE RAIL AND OTHER PROJECTS REQUIRE SECURITY  THEY EXTEND THE CHINESE GOVERNMENTS POLITICAL REACH INTO CENTRAL ASIA  PAKISTAN AND THE MIDDLE EAST  AND AS BEIJING TURNS THE SOUTH CHINA SEA INTO A VAST GAME OF GO  ITS NEW PORTS IN BANGLADESH  SRI LANKA  PAKISTAN AND  POTENTIALLY  THE MALDIVES START TO LOOK LIKE STILL MORE PLAYING TOKENS CHINAS PRETTY TALK OF DEVELOPMENT AND COOPERATION SOUNDS LIKE COVER FOR A STRATEGIC ADVANCE  AND OF COURSE IT IS THAT  BUT BESIDES INVESTING FINANCIALLY IN INFRASTRUCTURE  ONE BELT  ONE ROAD ALSO INVESTS CHINAS PRESTIGE IN A GLOBALIST MESSAGE THAT SOUNDS ALL THE RIGHT NOTES  PEACE  MULTICULTURAL TOLERANCE  MUTUAL PROSPERITY  AND THAT RHETORIC SETS STANDARDS BY WHICH TO HOLD CHINA ACCOUNTABLE THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS ROLLED OUT THE INITIATIVE WITH FANFARE  CASTING IT AS PRESIDENT XI JINPINGS SIGNATURE FOREIGN POLICY PROJECT  AND OUTSIDERS HAVE IN TURN TREATED IT AS A MONOLITHIC VENTURE  IN FACT  IT IS MADE UP OF MANY ELEMENTS  CULTURAL  DIPLOMATIC  DEVELOPMENTAL  AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL AND STRATEGIC  YOU CANT GIVE THUMBS UP OR THUMBS DOWN TO THE WHOLE PACKAGE  BECAUSE ONE BELT  ONE ROAD IS NOTHING LESS THAN THE REBRANDING OF CHINAS ENTIRE FOREIGN POLICY  IN ALL ITS COMPLEXITY FOR EXAMPLE  COMPLEMENTING THE INITIATIVES HARDER EDGE IS A CULTURAL COMPONENT THAT OBSERVERS OFTEN OVERLOOK  NUMEROUS SCHOOL PROGRAMS  CULTURAL EXCHANGES  ART SHOWS  MUSEUM EXHIBITIONS  MUSICAL PERFORMANCES  DANCE CONCERTS  ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXPLORATIONS AND UNESCO COLLABORATIONS  THESE EXTENSIONS OF CHINESE SOFT POWER PLAY ON THE IDEA OF THE SILK ROAD  THAT MYTHICAL ANCIENT GOLDEN AGE OF UNTRAMMELED TRADE AND CROSS CULTURAL SYNERGY  IN FACT  THERE NEVER REALLY WAS A SINGLE SILK ROAD  NOR SEVERAL ROADS  LINKING EAST TO WEST THAT YOU COULD DRAW ON A MAP  RATHER  TRADE FANNED OUT IN NETWORKS ACROSS THE BREADTH OF EURASIA  AS IT DID ELSEWHERE  AND MACHINATIONS OF EMPIRES ALWAYS PLAYED A LARGER ROLE IN PROMOTING EXCHANGES THAN DID INTREPID PRIVATE TRADERS BUT THE IDEA OF THE SILK ROAD  UNLIKE  SAY  THE IDEA OF THE GREAT GAME  IS NONTHREATENING  A SEPIA TINGED VISION OF CAMELS AND BAZAARS FULL OF EXOTIC LUXURIES  CHINA HAS CLEVERLY PINNED ITS FOREIGN POLICY TO A PLEASANT HISTORICAL MYTH THAT UNITES THE PEOPLES OF AFRO EURASIA  IT IS A FABLE THAT CAN LITERALLY BE TOLD AS A BEDTIME STORY ABOUT SHARING AND GIRAFFES TO THE CYNICAL  THIS IS JUST SO MUCH PROPAGANDISTIC TREACLE  BUT CHINA IS ALSO NOW LOUDLY SPEAKING THE LANGUAGE OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT  IT HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT IS STEPPING UP TO BE A GLOBAL GOOD CITIZEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE ECONOMIC WELL BEING OF ITS NEIGHBORS  SINCERE OR NOT  THE MESSAGE IS AT LEAST SUPRANATIONAL  IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE PROTECTIONISM AND XENOPHOBIA DISPLAYED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP AND EMERGING NATIONALISTIC IDEOLOGIES IN EUROPE  INDIA AND ELSEWHERE THE GEORGE W  BUSH ADMINISTRATIONS 2005 CALL FOR CHINA TO BECOME A RESPONSIBLE STAKEHOLDER IN WORLD AFFAIRS MAY HAVE BEEN PATRONIZING  BUT IT WAS ALSO FORWARD LOOKING  ONE BELT  ONE ROAD IS BEIJINGS FULL THROATED ANSWER TO THAT CHALLENGE  EVEN IF IT ASSERTS CHINAS INDEPENDENCE FROM AN AMERICA CENTERED WORLD ORDER  RATHER THAN A CONVERGENCE WITH IT IS A NEW APPROACH  BY A NEW PLAYER  SUCH A BAD THING  THE ECONOMIC ORTHODOXY LONG IMPOSED BY THE UNITED STATES DOMINATED WORLD BANK AND INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND ON DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IN CRISIS  A REFORM PACKAGE KNOWN AS THE WASHINGTON CONSENSUS  HAS ENJOYED A MIXED RECORD AT BEST  AND IN AFRICA  FOR EXAMPLE  WESTERN INVESTMENT REMAINS SMALL  GIVEN THE CONTINENTS SIZE  POPULATION AND NEEDS CHINA  FOR ITS PART  HAS EMBRACED AFRICA  ALTHOUGH SOME OF ITS PROJECTS HAVE CODDLED CORRUPT DICTATORS IN ORDER TO HAUL OFF AFRICAN RAW MATERIALS  OTHERS HAVE DELIVERED CONCRETE ECONOMIC BENEFITS LOCALLY  MOREOVER  SOME CHINESE GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATE INVESTORS HAVE PROVED WILLING TO TAKE RISKS THAT WESTERN CORPORATIONS AND COUNTRIES HAVE CONSISTENTLY AVOIDED SOME OF CHINAS SILK ROAD PROJECTS WILL BE BOONDOGGLES  SOME WILL PRODUCE ECONOMIC BENEFITS  SOME MAY BE EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING POVERTY  SOME WILL PROMOTE CHINESE STATE AND CORPORATE INTERESTS  ONE BELT  ONE ROAD  WITH ITS MANY FACES  IS NEITHER A NEFARIOUS PLOT FOR WORLD DOMINATION NOR THE ANSWER TO ALL THE WORLDS PROBLEMS  WE SHOULD EVALUATE ITS PROJECTS INDIVIDUALLY AND HOLD THEM TO THE GOAL THAT THE BROADER INITIATIVE HAS SET FOR ITSELF  TO BUILD A BETTER FUTURE MODELED ON AN IDEALIZED PAST

20180503,business,market,2,SUNPOWER IS THE NATIONS NO  2 COMMERCIAL SOLAR POWER COMPANY  EMPLOYING THOUSANDS OF WORKERS DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY  BUT IT MAKES MOST OF ITS SOLAR PANELS ABROAD  AND WITH THE TARIFFS RECENTLY IMPOSED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP COSTING IT AS MUCH AS  MILLION A WEEK  SUNPOWER IS FIGHTING FOR AN EXEMPTION ONE OF ITS RIVALS  SOLARWORLD AMERICAS  PRODUCES PANELS DOMESTICALLY  BUFFETED BY FOREIGN COMPETITION  IT WAS BEHIND THE ORIGINAL PUSH FOR THE TARIFFS NOW THE TWO AMERICAN COMPANIES ARE MERGING ITS ALL PART OF THE DISRUPTION  DISTORTION AND UNCERTAINTY FROM AN ESCALATING TRADE OFFENSIVE AIMED PRIMARILY AT CHINA  IN BARELY THREE MONTHS  THE TARIFFS  THE FIRST SHOT FIRED BY MR  TRUMP IN THAT CAMPAIGN  ARE FUNDAMENTALLY RESHAPING THE SOLAR INDUSTRY AND ITS PROSPECTS A CHINESE PLAYER ANNOUNCED PLANS TO OPEN A FACTORY IN FLORIDA AS EARLY AS THIS FALL  WITH ITS SOLARWORLD ACQUISITION  SUNPOWER MOVED TO PREVENT FURTHER LOSS TO ITS BUSINESS BY LOCATING A BIGGER SHARE OF ITS PRODUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES  BOTH COMPANIES ARE BEING HIT WITH TARIFFS ON HIGH EFFICIENCY PANELS THEY PRODUCE IN MALAYSIA THOSE EFFORTS ONLY BLUNT THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THE INDUSTRY FALLOUT  WHILE PRODUCING MORE PANELS IN THE UNITED STATES WILL CREATE A FEW HUNDRED JOBS  THE TARIFFS COULD COST TENS OF THOUSANDS  LARGELY ON THE INSTALLATION SIDE OF THE BUSINESS  DOZENS OF SOLAR COMPANIES ARE NOW PETITIONING TO BE EXEMPTED FROM THE TARIFFS  AND A BIPARTISAN GROUP IN CONGRESS HAS INTRODUCED A BILL TO OVERTURN THEM ALTOGETHER I THINK THAT ANY ACTION THAT BRINGS NEW INVESTMENT TO THE UNITED STATES IS WELCOME  SAID ABIGAIL ROSS HOPPER  PRESIDENT OF THE SOLAR ENERGY INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION  BUT THE TARIFFS HAVE SLOWED DOWN THE GROWTH OF OUR INDUSTRY  THE GROWTH HAS BEEN MUTED  AND THAT MEANS JOBS ARE NOT BEING CREATED  HER GROUP SAID THE TARIFFS COULD COST AS MANY AS 23 000 AMERICAN JOBS THIS YEAR IN ADDITION  THE 30 PERCENT TARIFFS ARE GOING TO MAKE IT MORE EXPENSIVE FOR CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO PURSUE THEIR GOAL OF PROMOTING SOLAR POWER AS A WAY TO CURB CARBON POLLUTION THE SOLAR INDUSTRY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE ADDING INSTALLATIONS  BUT GROWTH IS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 11 PERCENT LOWER THAN PROJECTIONS BEFORE THE TARIFFS THOSE DIMINISHED PROSPECTS ARE WHAT PROMPTED SUNPOWER TO BULK UP ITS OPERATIONS BY PURSUING THE PURCHASE OF SOLARWORLD  BASED IN HILLSBORO  ORE  WE UNDERSTAND THE GOAL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE GOAL OF THIS ADMINISTRATION  SAID TOM WERNER  SUNPOWERS CHIEF EXECUTIVE  WE DECIDED THAT WE WILL BE A LEADER  AND WE WILL TAKE A BOLD MOVE AND BUY AN AMERICAN ENTERPRISE THE OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE  WHICH IS HANDLING THE TARIFFS  IS REVIEWING THE REQUESTS FROM SUNPOWER AND OTHER COMPANIES FOR EXEMPTIONS  NO TIME FRAME FOR A DECISION HAS BEEN SET TO BE EXCLUDED  THE COMPANIES MUST SHOW THAT THEY HAVE A UNIQUE TECHNOLOGY OR OFFERING  SUNPOWER  BASED IN SAN JOSE  CALIF  SAID ITS PRODUCTS SERVED A NEED UNMET BY EXISTING AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS  AND WERE MADE OVERSEAS FOR PROXIMITY TO ITS SUPPLIERS  LARGELY IN ASIA  MAKING THE SOLAR PANELS CHEAPER WERE KIND OF COLLATERAL DAMAGE  MR  WERNER SAID OF THE TARIFFS THE UPHEAVAL EXTENDS TO THE CONSUMERS OF SOLAR PRODUCTS  NOT JUST THE MAKERS  THE INDUSTRY IS IN A SCRAMBLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ALL OF THE IMPACTS ARE  SAID ROB FREEMAN  CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF TRADEWIND ENERGY  WHICH IS BASED IN KANSAS OUTSIDE KANSAS CITY AND DEVELOPS INDUSTRIAL SCALE SOLAR AND WIND PROJECTS  I THINK ITS FAIR TO SAY IT COULD BE WORSE  I THINK ITS FAIR TO SAY ITS A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE THE EFFECT OF THE TARIFFS ON THE COST OF IMPORTED SOLAR PANELS MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO COMPETE WITH OTHER SOURCES OF POWER LIKE WIND  OR EVEN MAKES FOSSIL FUEL PLANTS LOOK ATTRACTIVE AGAIN  MR  FREEMAN SAID  IT TIPS IT BACK IN FAVOR OF OTHER ALTERNATIVES  HE ADDED AND THEN THERE ARE THE JOBS SUNPOWER  WHICH IS TAKING OVER AN OPERATION WITH 280 EMPLOYEES  SAID IT HAD NOT DETERMINED HOW MANY JOBS IT MIGHT ADD  THE COMPANY SAID JINKOSOLAR  A SHANGHAI COMPANY  ANNOUNCED THIS YEAR THAT IT WOULD START MANUFACTURING IN JACKSONVILLE  FLA  AND CREATE ABOUT 200 JOBS  IT ALREADY HAS A DEAL WITH FLORIDA BASED NEXTERA ENERGY TO SUPPLY THE PARENT COMPANY OF FLORIDAS LARGEST UTILITY WITH SEVEN MILLION PANELS OVER FOUR YEARS  ONE OF THE LARGEST ORDERS TO DATE JINKOSOLAR SAID IT STILL NEEDED EXCLUSION FROM THE TARIFFS TO BRING ANY SIGNIFICANT SCALE TO ITS AMERICAN OPERATIONS  WHILE IT WILL ASSEMBLE PANELS IN THE UNITED STATES  THE SOLAR CELLS WILL CONTINUE TO BE PRODUCED IN ASIA AND SUBJECT TO TARIFFS WE WOULD NOT EXPAND IT IF WE DONT GET ALLOWED TARIFF FREE CELLS  SAID NIGEL COCKROFT  THE COMPANYS UNITED STATES GENERAL MANAGER EVEN AS THOSE PROJECTS BRING PROSPECTIVE JOBS  THE SOLAR ENERGY INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION POINTED TO THE POTENTIAL JOB LOSSES FROM THE SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF SOLAR PROJECTS BECAUSE OF HIGHER COSTS  IT SAID DOMESTIC OPERATIONS ALONE COULD NOT MEET THE PREVIOUS LEVEL OF DEMAND IN SOME WAYS  THIS IS SHOWING THAT THE TARIFF IS HAVING SOME KIND OF EFFECT  BUT IT DOESNT NECESSARILY GROW THE U S  MANUFACTURING MARKET  SAID MJ SHIAO  GLOBAL LEAD FOR RENEWABLES AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AT WOOD MACKENZIE  A RESEARCH AND CONSULTING FIRM WITH UNITED STATES HEADQUARTERS IN HOUSTON THE PROJECTS NO LONGER PENCIL OUT  MR  SHIAO SAID SOLAR ENERGY ENJOYED A BANNER YEAR IN 2016  WHEN THERE WAS A RUSH TO GET PROJECTS GOING BEFORE A FEDERAL TAX CREDIT ON SOLAR PROJECTS WAS TO EXPIRE  IN THAT YEAR  IT BECAME THE NATIONS LEADING SOURCE OF NEW ELECTRICITY GENERATION BUT AFTER THAT FLURRY  SOLAR YIELDED ITS NO  1 SPOT EVEN THOUGH CONGRESS EXTENDED THE 30 PERCENT TAX CREDIT THROUGH 2019  NOW THE TARIFFS HAVE ADDED ANOTHER BUMP IN THE ROAD FOR SOLAR POWER BEFORE THE TARIFFS  THE INDUSTRY WAS EXPECTED TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO POWER 13 7 MILLION HOMES NATIONWIDE BY 2022  ACCORDING TO THE SOLAR INDUSTRY GROUP  THAT ESTIMATE HAS BEEN REVISED DOWNWARD BY MORE THAN 10 PERCENT THERE MIGHT BE SOME PLACES WHERE SOLAR WOULD HAVE WON FOR NEW GENERATION THAT NOW MIGHT REVERT BACK TO WIND OR NATURAL GAS  MR  SHIAO SAID  IN SOME CASES NOTHING IS GOING TO FILL THAT VOID MS  HOPPER OF THE INDUSTRY GROUP SAID SHE HOPED THAT CONGRESS WOULD REPEAL THE TARIFFS WITH A BILL NOW BEFORE LAWMAKERS  REPRESENTATIVE JACKY ROSEN  A NEVADA DEMOCRAT  INTRODUCED THE BILL OUT OF CONCERN OVER THE LOSS OF JOBS IN HER STATE  TWO SOUTH CAROLINA REPUBLICANS  REPRESENTATIVES MARK SANFORD AND RALPH NORMAN  BACKED THE LEGISLATION  CITING NOT ONLY JOBS BUT ALSO THE ADDED COST THE TARIFFS IMPOSED ON BUSINESS  THE BIPARTISAN NATURE OF THE EFFORT GIVES THE INDUSTRY HOPE THAT IT MIGHT FIND SUPPORT SOLAR POWER  WHICH NOW GENERATES ALMOST 2 PERCENT OF THE NATIONS ELECTRICITY  HAS BECOME POPULAR AMONG DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ALIKE  AS PEOPLE CONSIDER WAYS TO HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR ENERGY USE AND TO REDUCE POLLUTION AS WELL AS CREATE JOBS WE THINK THAT THE INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO GROW  MS  HOPPER SAID  I THINK THAT THE OUTLOOK IS STILL POSITIVE BUT NOT QUITE AS POSITIVE AS IT COULD BE

TRACK DOWN A SUSPECTED CALIFORNIA SERIAL KILLER  RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT HOW ELSE OUR MOST INTIMATE INFORMATION COULD BE WIELDED BY THE STATE  AND AS DNA TEST RESULTS ARE SHARED PUBLICLY  SPAWNING THEIR OWN YOUTUBE GENRE  AM I REALLY HISPANIC  DNA TEST RESULTS  AND TWITTER MEMES  THEY TRANSFORM INTO A TOOL FOR TALKING NOT JUST ABOUT OURSELVES  BUT ABOUT RACE  OFTEN IN WAYS THAT OBSCURE ITS

WHITE SUPREMACISTS ARE DRAWN TO DNA TESTING TO PROVE THEIR RACIAL PURITY  EXCITEDLY PUBLICIZING THEIR EXCLUSIVELY EUROPEAN ANCESTRIES  OR ELSE DISMISSING ANY TRACE OF OUTSIDE DNA AS A JEWISH

THAT THE AFRICAN DNA WAS INTRODUCED IN MR  HABERSBERGERS BLOODLINE BETWEEN 1720 AND 1810  THE MOOD SOURS  AS MR  KORNFELD PUTS IT  I THOUGHT THIS WAS REAL COOL UNTIL I REMEMBERED WHAT THE BRITISH WERE DOING IN THE 1700S  AND NOW IM THINKING ITS LESS COOL EVEN IN VIDEOS THAT SEEK TO DISPEL RACISM THROUGH MULTICULTURAL CELEBRATION  HISTORICAL REALITIES SNEAK IN  AND THAT LEADS TO ANOTHER FORM OF

20180506,business,economy,7,WHITTIER  CALIF   FOR ANYONE WONDERING ABOUT THE STATE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN CALIFORNIA THESE DAYS  CONSIDER THIS  THERE MAY BE NO REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR OR UNITED STATES SENATOR ON THE STATES BALLOT THIS NOVEMBER THAT DISPIRITING POSSIBILITY IS BEGINNING TO SINK IN FOR CALIFORNIA REPUBLICANS  AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF A DIVISIVE DEBATE AMONG ITS CANDIDATES AND LEADERS ON HOW THE EMBATTLED PARTY CAN BECOME COMPETITIVE AGAIN IN A STATE WHERE RONALD REAGAN WAS ELECTED TWICE AS GOVERNOR AND THAT RICHARD M  NIXON CALLED HOME ITS NO SECRET THE STATES REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS BEEN IN A DECLINE FOR 20 YEARS  ITS CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN AGGRAVATED BY THE ELECTION OF PRESIDENT TRUMP  AS HE HAS PUSHED TOUGHER POLICIES ON SUCH ISSUES AS IMMIGRATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT  RUNNING UP AGAINST STRONG AND OFTEN BIPARTISAN SENTIMENT IN CALIFORNIA A FIELD OF REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND GOVERNOR IS STRUGGLING AGAINST THESE HEADWINDS AS THEY SEEK TO END A MORE THAN 10 YEAR DROUGHT AND ELECT A PARTY MEMBER TO STATEWIDE OFFICE  UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ELECTION SYSTEM  CANDIDATES COMPETE IN AN OPEN  NONPARTISAN PRIMARY ON JUNE 5  THE TWO CANDIDATES WHO GET THE MOST VOTES  REGARDLESS OF PARTY  ADVANCE TO THE NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTION IF REPUBLICANS FALL SHORT IN CAPTURING ONE OF THOSE TWO NOVEMBER SLOTS NEXT MONTH  WHICH MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES SAY IS A STRONG POSSIBILITY  IT WOULD APPARENTLY BE THE FIRST ELECTION SINCE 1914 WHERE A MAJOR PARTY HAD NO CANDIDATE IN EITHER THE RACE FOR SENATOR OR FOR GOVERNOR REPUBLICAN HOPES OF GETTING A SPOT ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT SUFFERED ANOTHER SETBACK ON SUNDAY WHEN PARTY LEADERS  MEETING IN SAN DIEGO  FAILED TO AGREE ON ANYONE TO ENDORSE IN THE JUNE PRIMARY MAYBE HITTING ROCK BOTTOM IS GETTING SHUT OUT OF BOTH STATE RACES THIS YEAR  SAID BILL WHALEN  A RESEARCH FELLOW AT THE HOOVER INSTITUTION AND A FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO PETE WILSON  A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR  YOU WOULD THINK THAT IF REPUBLICANS ARE SHUT OUT  IT WILL BE TIME FOR SOME SERIOUS SOUL SEARCHING THE PARTY  IF FAR FROM THE DOMINANT POWER IT WAS ONCE IN CALIFORNIA  IS STILL A FORCE  TWO OF THE MOST POWERFUL REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP REPRESENT CENTRAL CALIFORNIA  KEVIN MCCARTHY  A CLOSE ALLY OF MR  TRUMP  WHO IS IN LINE TO BECOME THE NEXT SPEAKER SHOULD REPUBLICANS HOLD THE HOUSE THIS NOVEMBER  AND DEVIN NUNES  THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE  BOTH ARE POPULAR IN THEIR DISTRICTS AND WIELD PLENTY OF INFLUENCE IN WASHINGTON THERE ARE POCKETS OF REPUBLICAN STRENGTH ACROSS THE STATE  IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA  THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND SOME SUBURBS  A REMNANT OF WHEN IT WAS DOMINANT STATEWIDE BUT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HOLDS NO STATEWIDE OFFICES  DEMOCRATS CONTROL BOTH HOUSES OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE  PARTY REGISTRATION IS ON THE DECLINE  AND ONE OF THE POTENTIAL REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES FOR SENATE WHO SOME POLLS SUGGEST HAS AT LEAST A THEORETICAL SHOT OF MAKING IT TO THE NOVEMBER BALLOT IS PATRICK LITTLE  AN EXTREMIST WHO HAS CALLED FOR THE COUNTRY TO BE FREE FROM JEWS THERE HAVE BEEN HARD LINE STRAINS IN THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY FOR YEARS  CENTERED AROUND LAW AND ORDER  TAXES AND IMMIGRATION ISSUES  BUT THIS IS ALSO A STATE WITH A MODERATE WING A GROUP OF REPUBLICANS LED BY ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER  THE FORMER REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR  AND CHAD MAYES  THE FORMER REPUBLICAN ASSEMBLY LEADER  HAVE BEGUN A CAMPAIGN TO MOVE THE PARTY TO THE CENTER  ARGUING THAT WOULD MAKE IT MORE COMPETITIVE BY INCREASING ITS APPEAL TO INDEPENDENT VOTERS AND DISAFFECTED DEMOCRATS BUT THAT EFFORT HAS RUN UP AGAINST REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES AND ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO HAVE TIED THEIR SUCCESS TO MR  TRUMP AND HIS ADMINISTRATIONS POLICIES ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER AND REPUBLICANS LIKE MAYES ARE COMPLETELY WRONG  TRAVIS ALLEN  A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR AND MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY  SAID IN AN INTERVIEW  CALIFORNIAN REPUBLICANS NEED TO STAND UP FOR COMMON SENSE AND THE RULE OF LAW AND THE FISCAL CONSERVATISM THAT HAS BEEN SORELY LACKING IN OUR STATE FOR DECADES  MAYES AND SCHWARZENEGGER HAVE DONE A DISSERVICE TO EVERY CALIFORNIAN WHO BELIEVES IN LIMITED GOVERNMENT  RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND FISCAL SANITY THIS IS WHY REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN LOSING FOR DECADES IN CALIFORNIA  HE SAID  THESE SO CALLED REPUBLICAN LITES THAT ARE PANDERING TO DEMOCRAT POLICIES AND POLITICIANS ARE WHY CALIFORNIANS ARE NOW REGISTERING AS DECLINE TO STATE IN EVER INCREASING NUMBERS INDEED  THE MODERATE POLITICAL LINE BEING ADVOCATED BY MR  SCHWARZENEGGER AND MR  MAYES IS NOT REFLECTED BY ANY OF THE LIMITED NUMBER OF VIABLE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES FOR STATEWIDE OFFICE THE DIVISION OVER THE FUTURE OF THE PARTY WAS ON FULL DISPLAY THE OTHER NIGHT AT A FORUM SPONSORED BY THE NORTH ORANGE COUNTY REPUBLICAN WOMENS FEDERATED DINNER FOR MR  ALLEN AND ANOTHER REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR  JOHN COX  A BUSINESSMAN  THE ONLY TWO REPUBLICANS IN A VERY CROWDED FIELD WHO APPEAR TO HAVE A CHANCE TO CAPTURE ONE OF THE TOP TWO SPOTS IN THE PRIMARY RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP  MR  ALLEN SAID FROM THE STAGE AS MOST OF THE HANDS WENT UP  IN 2016 WE TOOK BACK OUR COUNTRY  IN 2018 WE ARE TAKING BACK CALIFORNIA A FEW MOMENTS LATER  BOTH CANDIDATES TOLD THE MODERATOR THAT THEY FIRMLY SUPPORTED MR  TRUMPS CALL TO BUILD A WALL ALONG THE MEXICAN BORDER  A BORDER WALL SHOULD NOT BE CONTROVERSIAL AT ALL  MR  COX SAID  THAT SHOULD BE THE NO  1 THING WE DO  WE HAVE A COUNTRY TO THE SOUTH OF US THAT IS RELATIVELY UNGOVERNED NOW I SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT  BY THE WAY  100 PERCENT  HE SAID  IM GLAD HES PRESIDENT MR  MAYES  WHO WAS OUSTED AS THE REPUBLICAN LEADER OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY AFTER HE NEGOTIATED A REPUBLICAN VOTE DELIVERING COMPROMISE WITH GOV  JERRY BROWN  A DEMOCRAT  ON LEGISLATION TO CURB GREENHOUSE EMISSIONS  SAID THAT SENTIMENT THREATENED TO FURTHER DISTANCE THE PARTY FROM VOTERS WE WENT FROM HAVING AN APPROACH UNDER RONALD REAGAN AND GEORGE H W  BUSH WHERE WE LOVED AND CARED ABOUT PEOPLE AND WE WENT OUT OF OUR WAY TO MAKE PEOPLES LIVES WERE BETTER TO THIS US VERSUS THEM MENTALITY  HE SAID WE HAVE TO STOP MAKING EXCUSES FOR NOT WINNING IN CALIFORNIA  MR  MAYES ADDED  WE NEED TO COME TO GRIPS WITH REALITY AND UNDERSTAND THE ELECTORATE IN CALIFORNIA HAS CHANGED  WE HAVE TO GO TO THEM  WE ARE NOT GOING TO WIN ELECTIONS UNTIL WE FIGURE THAT OUT BUT MANY REPUBLICANS ECHO THE CONCERNS BEING EXPRESSED BY CANDIDATES THIS CAMPAIGN SEASON ABOUT IMMIGRATION  AS WELL AS THEIR SUPPORT FOR MR  TRUMP  JIM DE MARTINI  A FARMER AND LOCAL REPUBLICAN COUNTY LEADER IN STANISLAUS COUNTY  SAID HE THOUGHT THE PRESIDENT AND HIS POLICIES  ON THE ECONOMY  IMMIGRATION AND FOREIGN POLICY  WOULD RESONATE FOR VOTERS HERE  HES DONE A GREAT JOB ON THE ECONOMY  HE SAID  TAX CUTS  PROMOTING BUSINESS MR  DE MARTINI  REFLECTING WHAT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN A SOURCE OF REPUBLICAN STRENGTH IN THE STATE  SAID THE PARTY SHOULD BE FOCUSING AS WELL ON WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS OVERSPENDING AND OVERREGULATION BY DEMOCRATS WHO CONTROL THE STATE GOVERNMENT THE ECONOMY IS ALWAYS THE BIG ISSUE BECAUSE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN IRRESPONSIBLE IN ITS BUDGET  BANKRUPTING THE STATE  AND OVERREGULATING  HE SAID  IT IS DESTROYING THE STATE THE PROSPECT THAT THERE MAY BE NO REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR SENATE OR GOVERNOR THIS NOVEMBER CASTS BOTH SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM THREATS FOR THE PARTY FOR THIS ELECTION  IT COULD COMPLICATE EFFORTS TO DRAW REPUBLICANS TO THE POLLS IN A YEAR WHEN DEMOCRATS ARE LOOKING TO OUST AS MANY AS SEVEN ENDANGERED REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS  TO TRY TO COUNTER THAT  REPUBLICANS  INCLUDING MR  MCCARTHY  ARE PUSHING AN INITIATIVE FOR THE NOVEMBER BALLOT TO REPEAL A GASOLINE TAX INSTITUTED BY DEMOCRATS IN THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR  FOR THE LONG TERM  IT IS A REMINDER OF JUST HOW LITTLE INFLUENCE THE PARTY HAS STATEWIDE  REPUBLICANS FAILED TO WIN A SPOT ON THE 2016 BALLOT FOR SENATE AS WELL ITS IMPORTANT THAT WE START TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT ISSUES  SAID ROCKY CHAVEZ  A REPUBLICAN MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY WHO IS RUNNING FOR A CONGRESSIONAL SEAT LEFT OPEN BY THE RETIREMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE DARRELL ISSA OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY  THE ENVIRONMENT IS AN IMPORTANT THING IN CALIFORNIA  THATS NOT SOMETHING REPUBLICANS ALWAYS TALK ABOUT BUT MR  CHAVEZS ARGUMENT FAILED TO WIN HIM THE SUPPORT OF THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY REPUBLICAN PARTY AND MR  ISSA  IT INSTEAD BACKED DIANE HARKEY  A FORMER MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY WHO HAS  LIKE MR  ISSA  STRUCK A MORE HARDENED CONSERVATIVE LINE ONE OF THE KEY POINTS OF CONTENTION WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN THE STATE IS IMMIGRATION  IT HAS BEEN A COMPLICATION FOR REPUBLICANS SINCE CALIFORNIA VOTERS PASSED AN INITIATIVE PUSHED BY THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR  PETE WILSON  IN 1994 TO PROHIBIT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM GETTING STATE SOCIAL SERVICES  THAT INITIATIVE  WHICH WAS THROWN OUT IN COURT  WAS SEEN AS ONE OF THE CRITICAL REASONS FOR THE PARTYS DECLINE  AS THE LATINO POPULATION IN THIS STATE HAS CONTINUED TO GROW  AND AS CALIFORNIA BECAME MORE DEMOCRATIC DEMOCRATS MAKE UP NEARLY 45 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF REGISTERED VOTERS IN THE STATE  REPUBLICANS ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 25 PERCENT  JUST SLIGHTLY AHEAD OF THE PERCENTAGE OF VOTERS WHO DECLINED TO PICK A PARTY REGISTRATION GIVEN THE CHANGING POLITICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC TIDES  MANY REPUBLICANS HAVE  SINCE 1994  SOUGHT TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE TOUGHER IMMIGRATION POSITIONS IN AN EFFORT TO EXPAND THE PARTYS APPEAL  BUT MR  TRUMP PUSHED IMMIGRATION BACK TO THE FRONT BURNER  AND DEMOCRATS RESPONDED BY PASSING SO CALLED SANCTUARY STATE LAWS INTENDED TO HAMPER EFFORTS BY FEDERAL IMMIGRATION OFFICERS THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS THE SANCTUARY STATE THING  SAID MR  COX  THE BUSINESSMAN RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR  THE POLITICIANS SEEM TO BE FAVORING CRIMINALS MORE THAN LAW ABIDING CITIZENS FINALLY  MR  TRUMP HIMSELF HAS EMERGED AS A CRITICAL ISSUE AS REPUBLICANS TRY TO CHART A PATH FORWARD  MR  TRUMP LOST CALIFORNIA BY NEARLY FOUR MILLION VOTES  AND HE REMAINS CONSISTENTLY UNPOPULAR OVERALL  BUT HE IS POPULAR WITH REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS  AND CANDIDATES HAVE LINED UP BEHIND HIM IM AT A FORUM A FEW WEEKS AGO AND IM LISTENING

20180505,politics,election,8,SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM ONCE DESCRIBED HIS FRIEND JOHN MCCAIN AS SOMEONE WHO WOULD RUN ACROSS THE STREET TO GET IN A GOOD FIGHT MCCAINS FINAL BATTLE CAME STRAIGHT TO HIM IM NOT TALKING ABOUT THE ONE AGAINST BRAIN CANCER  WHICH HAS KEPT THE 81 YEAR OLD SENATOR AT HOME IN ARIZONA FOR MONTHS AND PROMPTED MANY FRIENDS  INCLUDING JOE BIDEN  TO TRAVEL THERE RECENTLY TO SEE HIM  POSSIBLY FOR THE LAST TIME  IM TALKING ABOUT THE ONE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP MCCAIN HAS WAGED IT IN PUBLIC REMARKS SINCE TRUMPS ELECTION  INCLUDING A SPEECH IN PHILADELPHIA LAST OCTOBER  WHEN HE PUSHED BACK AGAINST THE HALF BAKED  SPURIOUS NATIONALISM THAT WAS GRIPPING TOO MANY AMERICANS AND LAMENTED THE ABDICATION OF AMERICAS MORAL LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD HE WAGES IT IN A FORTHCOMING BOOK  THE RESTLESS WAVE  AN ADVANCE EXCERPT OF WHICH INCLUDES HIS COMPLAINT THAT TRUMP FAILS TO DISTINGUISH THE ACTIONS OF OUR GOVERNMENT FROM THE CRIMES OF DESPOTIC ONES AND THAT HE PRIORITIZES A REALITY SHOW FACSIMILE OF TOUGHNESS OVER ANY OF OUR VALUES THE FIGHT ISNT REALLY BETWEEN TWO MEN  ITS BETWEEN TWO TAKES ON WHAT MATTERS MOST IN THIS MESSY WORLD  I MIGHT AS WELL BE BLUNT  ITS BETWEEN THE HIGH ROAD AND THE GUTTER  MCCAIN HAS ALWAYS BELIEVED  TO HIS CORE  IN SACRIFICE  HONOR AND ALLEGIANCE TO SOMETHING LARGER THAN ONESELF  TRUMP BELIEVES IN TRUMP  AND WHATEVER WRECKAGE HE CAUSES IN DEFERENCE TO THAT GOD IS OF NO CONCERN TRUMP IS IN EVERY SINGLE WAY THE OPPOSITE OF JOHN MCCAIN  BOB KERREY TOLD ME RECENTLY  HE MAY BE THE OPPOSITE OF EVERY PRESIDENT WE EVER HAD  KERREY AND MCCAIN BOTH SERVED IN VIETNAM  THEY OVERLAPPED IN THE SENATE AND THEY STAY IN TOUCH  SO KERREY KNOWS THAT TRUMP HAS CAUSED MCCAIN NO SMALL MEASURE OF ANGUISH  BUT LESS BECAUSE OF TRUMPS CRASSNESS AND THE DAILY TRAGICOMEDY OF HIS ADMINISTRATION  THIS  TOO  SHALL PASS  THAN BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT ON DEMOCRACY  IT COULD BE ENDURING  AND IT COULD BE PROFOUND THATS WHY A PATRIOT LIKE HIM COULD NEVER SIT THIS ONE OUT TRUMP FINDS MCCAINS BIOGRAPHY AND EXAMPLE THREATENING  THAT WAS OBVIOUS IN AN INSULT IN THE SUMMER OF 2015  JUST A MONTH INTO TRUMPS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  AT A FORUM IN IOWA  TRUMP MOCKED MCCAINS MANY YEARS AS A PRISONER OF WAR IN VIETNAM  YEARS DURING WHICH MCCAIN REFUSED OFFERS OF RELEASE BECAUSE HE DIDNT WANT TO BE A TOOL OF NORTH VIETNAMESE PROPAGANDA  BY SAYING  HES NOT A WAR HERO  HES A WAR HERO BECAUSE HE WAS CAPTURED  I LIKE PEOPLE THAT WERENT CAPTURED MCCAIN BRUSHED IT OFF  HE NEVER MENTIONED IT  GEN  DAVID PETRAEUS  WHO SITS ON THE BOARD OF THE MCCAIN INSTITUTE FOR INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP AT ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY  TOLD ME  I RAISED IT WITH HIM ONE TIME  I SAID  I JUST WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT EVERYONE I KNOW  AND I  REGARD YOU AS AN EXTRAORDINARY HERO  HE SAID  I KNOW  ITS NOTHING ITS ALL TOO EASY  IN THE CONTEXT OF TRUMP  TO IDEALIZE POLITICAL LEADERS WHO CAME BEFORE HIM AND AIRBRUSH THEIR FLAWS  MCCAIN HAS HIS SHARE  INCLUDING THE OCCASIONAL RASHNESS REFLECTED IN HIS SELECTION OF SARAH PALIN AS A RUNNING MATE IN 2008  DID SHE HELP PAVE THE WAY FOR TRUMP  WHAT A CRUEL IRONY IF SO BUT ITS ALSO TRUE THAT TWO REPUBLICAN TITANS NEAR THE END OF THEIR DAYS PROVIDE CRYSTALLINE COUNTERPOINTS TO TRUMP  THEYRE STATESMEN TO HIS SALESMAN  ONE IS GEORGE H  W  BUSH  THE FORMER PRESIDENT  AND MY COLLEAGUE BRET STEPHENS RECENTLY WROTE A GORGEOUS MEDITATION ON THE DICHOTOMY OF BUSHS VERSUS TRUMPS APPROACH TO LEADERSHIP THE OTHER IS MCCAIN  WHO PRESENTS A SIMILAR DICHOTOMY CNN REPORTED WEDNESDAY THAT TRUMP  TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS HEALTH WHEN HE WAS A CANDIDATE  DICTATED THAT LUDICROUS  HALF PAGE DOCTORS NOTE THAT RAVED ABOUT HIS ASTONISHINGLY EXCELLENT CONDITION  MCCAIN ANSWERED HEALTH QUESTIONS DURING THE 2008 CAMPAIGN BY MAKING SEVERAL DOCTORS FROM THE MAYO CLINIC AVAILABLE TO REPORTERS AND BY GIVING SOME REPORTERS A LOOK  ALBEIT TIME LIMITED  AT PAGES UPON PAGES OF HIS ACTUAL MEDICAL RECORDS TRUMP CITED BONE SPURS IN HIS HEELS TO AVOID VIETNAM  MCCAIN  A NAVY PILOT  HAD AN ARM BROKEN AND RIBS CRACKED DURING THE TORTURE THAT HE ENDURED WHILE IMPRISONED BY THE NORTH VIETNAMESE TRUMP JUMP STARTED HIS POLITICAL CAREER WITH THE LIE THAT BARACK OBAMA WAS BORN OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND THUS AN ILLEGITIMATE PRESIDENT  DURING THE LAST WEEKS OF TRUMPS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  HE BRANDED HILLARY CLINTON A CRIMINAL AND ENCOURAGED SUPPORTERS TO CHANT  LOCK HER UP DURING THE LAST WEEKS OF MCCAINS 2008 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  HE GREW SO CONCERNED ABOUT SUPPORTERS HOSTILITY TO AND MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT OBAMA THAT HE CORRECTED AND ESSENTIALLY CHIDED THEM  HE IS A DECENT PERSON  HE TOLD A MAN WHO HAD VOLUNTEERED THAT HE WAS SCARED OF AN OBAMA PRESIDENCY  WHEN A WOMAN AT THAT SAME CAMPAIGN EVENT CHIMED IN THAT OBAMA WAS AN ARAB  MCCAIN TOLD HER THAT SHE WAS WRONG  HES A DECENT FAMILY MAN  HE ADDED TRUMP IS NEVER TO BLAME AND QUICK TO MALIGN ONETIME ALLIES WHO HAVE GROWN INCONVENIENT  MCCAIN NEVER BADMOUTHED PALIN  DESPITE AMPLE REASON  JOHN MCCAIN DOESNT THROW PEOPLE UNDER THE BUS FOR HIS DECISIONS  PETRAEUS SAID  ADDING  WHEN I ASKED HIM HOW RARE THAT WAS  OH  MAN  JUST LOOK AROUND TRUMP DEMANDS INSTANT GRATIFICATION  MCCAIN SERVED FOR FOUR YEARS IN THE HOUSE BEFORE HIS THREE DECADES IN THE SENATE  DURING WHICH HE WORKED HIS WAY UP TO HIS CHERISHED POST AS CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE  HE TRIED  AND FAILED  TO GET THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION IN 2000 BEFORE SUCCEEDING EIGHT YEARS LATER TRUMP INVITES PITY FOR ALL THE SLIGHTS HE SUFFERS PLUS PLENTY THAT HE ONLY IMAGINES  AND HE READILY BOASTS ABOUT ACHIEVEMENTS ACTUAL AND HALLUCINATED  I DONT HAVE A COMPLAINT  MCCAIN SAYS IN HIS BOOK  WHICH WAS WRITTEN WITH MARK SALTER AND WILL BE RELEASED ON MAY 22  HES GRATEFUL  HE ADDS  THAT HE MADE A SMALL PLACE FOR MYSELF IN THE STORY OF AMERICA  A SMALL PLACE  I SOMETIMES FORGET  THANKS TO TRUMP  WHAT THE MUSIC OF UNDERSTATEMENT SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS A SCARCITY OF HUMILITY IN POLITICS THESE DAYS  MCCAIN WRITES  I WONDER IF HE HAS ANYONE PARTICULAR IN MIND  NO  THATS A LIE  ALL OF US KNOW PRECISELY WHICH SOMEONE HE HAS IN MIND  THE SAME PERSON IN HIS THOUGHTS WHEN  IN MUNICH IN FEBRUARY 2017  HE EXPRESSED ALARM ABOUT AN INCREASING TURN AWAY FROM UNIVERSAL VALUES AND TOWARD OLD TIES OF BLOOD AND RACE  ABOUT THE HARDENING RESENTMENT WE SEE TOWARD IMMIGRANTS AND ABOUT THE GROWING INABILITYAND EVEN UNWILLINGNESSTO SEPARATE TRUTH FROM LIES IN HIS NEW BOOK HE CALLS OUT TRUMP BY NAME  SAYING THAT THE PRESIDENTS CRIES OF FAKE NEWS ARE COPIED BY AUTOCRATS WHO WANT TO DISCREDIT AND CONTROL A FREE PRESS AND THAT HIS LACK OF EMPATHY FOR REFUGEES IS APPALLING  THE WORLD EXPECTS US TO BE CONCERNED WITH THE CONDITION OF HUMANITY  MCCAIN WRITES  WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF THAT REPUTATION  IM NOT SURE THE PRESIDENT UNDERSTANDS THAT KERREY SAID THAT HISTORY IS NOT GOING TO BE KIND TO THOSE WHO WERE SILENT ABOUT TRUMPS ATTACK ON TRUTH  NORMS  CIVILITY AND SO MUCH ELSE  HAS MCCAIN BEEN QUITE VOCAL ENOUGH  I THINK HISTORY WILL SAY THAT HE WAS IN THE TOP 10 PERCENT OF THE CLASS  KERREY SAID  COULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER DONALD CRITCHLOW  A PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AT ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY  TOLD ME  IF TRUMPS PRESIDENCY FAILS  SENATOR MCCAIN WILL BE REMEMBERED AS A JEREMIAH WHO WARNED THAT THE PARTY HAD TAKEN A ROAD TO PERDITION  AND IF IT SUCCEEDS  THEN HE IS PART OF AN OLD GUARD VAINLY RESISTING A NEW DAY  CRITCHLOW SAID EITHER WAY HE HAS MY GRATITUDE  ALTHOUGH I DISAGREE WITH MANY OF HIS POLITICAL VIEWS  INCLUDING HIS TOO KEEN ITCH FOR FOREIGN INTERVENTION  THAT DOESNT PREVENT ME FROM ADMIRING HIM ENORMOUSLY  NOR SHOULD IT  A POINT THAT HE MAKES IN HIS BOOK I DONT REMEMBER ANOTHER TIME IN MY LIFE WHEN SO MANY AMERICANS CONSIDERED SOMEONES PARTISAN AFFILIATION A TEST OF WHETHER THAT PERSON WAS ENTITLED TO THEIR RESPECT  HE WRITES  RUEFULLY  ADDING THAT WHILE BIDEN  TED KENNEDY AND OTHER DEMOCRATIC FRIENDS OF HIS NEVER VOTED FOR THE SAME

PERCENT RAISE FOR TEACHERS IN WEST VIRGINIA  WHO HAD SHUT DOWN SCHOOLS FOR ALMOST TWO WEEKS THE TEACHERS WERE INTENT ON MAKING A STATEMENT  NO FUNDING  NO FUTURE  THEY CHANTED IN OKLAHOMA  AND THEIR MANTRA SEEMED TO CARRY THE DAY THAT ALL THIS TOOK PLACE IN SO CALLED RIGHT TO WORK STATES  WHERE THE POWER OF UNIONS IS LIMITED  RAISES SOME INTERESTING QUESTIONS  DO WEAK UNIONS GO HAND IN HAND WITH MORE EFFECTIVE POLITICAL ACTIVISM  WOULD STRONG ORGANIZED LABOR PREVENT TEACHERS FROM GETTING THEIR WAY  AFTER ALL  IN WISCONSIN  A STATE WHERE UNIONS WERE FAMOUSLY POWERFUL  PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS SUFFERED A HISTORIC DEFEAT AT THE HANDS OF GOV  SCOTT WALKER IN 2011 YET THE REALITY IS CLOSER TO THE OPPOSITE STRONG UNIONS TEND TO BE EFFECTIVE AT SECURING GAINS FOR WORKERS  WEAK UNIONS OFTEN SHORTCHANGE THE RANK AND FILE  THE DATA SHOW THAT WORKERS IN HEAVILY UNIONIZED AREAS EARN A SIGNIFICANT PREMIUM OVER WORKERS IN LIGHTLY UNIONIZED AREAS  AND UNLESS THE TEACHER MOVEMENTS IN WEST VIRGINIA  OKLAHOMA AND ARIZONA BREATHE NEW LIFE INTO UNIONS  OR BIRTH LASTING INSTITUTIONS TO REPLACE THEM  THEY ARE LIKELY TO BE SHORT LIVED PERHAPS COUNTERINTUITIVELY  ONE NEED LOOK NO FURTHER THAN WISCONSIN TO APPRECIATE THE BENEFITS OF STRONG UNIONS  THE MEASURES ENACTED BY GOVERNOR WALKER  WHICH ENDED TEACHERS ABILITY TO BARGAIN COLLECTIVELY OVER ANYTHING BUT BASE WAGES AND REQUIRED THE UNIONS TO WIN ANNUAL RECERTIFICATION VOTES TO OFFICIALLY STAY INTACT  SHOULD BY ALL RIGHTS HAVE DESTROYED PUBLIC EMPLOYEE UNIONS ACROSS THE STATE  BY SOME MEASURES THEY DID  MEMBERSHIP COLLAPSED AFTER 2011  FROM HALF OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES TO JUST OVER ONE QUARTER WITHIN FIVE YEARS BUT IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE  THE UNIONS HAVE NOT ONLY REMAINED VIABLE  THEYVE BECOME MORE AGGRESSIVE CONSIDER RACINE  A CITY OF ABOUT 75 000 IN SOUTHEASTERN WISCONSIN  WHOSE TEACHERS HAVE VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY TO RETAIN THEIR UNION JUST BEFORE THE WALKER MEASURES WERE ENACTED  THE UNION SECURED A TWO YEAR EXTENSION OF ITS FAVORABLE CONTRACT  WITH STRICT RULES ON CLASS SIZE  STAFFING AND EVALUATION PROCEDURES  WHEN THAT CONTRACT ENDED  THE UNION SAW TO IT THAT MOST OF THE KEY ELEMENTS WERE INSERTED INTO A HANDBOOK  SAID PETER KNOTEK  A RECENT PRESIDENT  THAT INCLUDED A REQUIREMENT THAT THE DISTRICT CONSULT WITH THE UNION ON POLICY CHANGES IN 2015  THE PRESIDENT OF THE RACINE SCHOOL BOARD TRIED TO ELIMINATE THIS PROVISION  HIS EFFORT NARROWLY FAILED  BUT THE TEACHERS WERE NOT SO FORGIVING  THE UNION RECRUITED CANDIDATES FOR THE NINE SCHOOL BOARD SEATS AND LOCKED DOWN EIGHT OF THEM IN THE NEXT YEARS ELECTION WE WERE PURSUING AN AGENDA OF GROWING POWER INDEPENDENT OF ANY OTHER INSTITUTION IN THE COMMUNITY  AARON EICK  ONE OF MR  KNOTEKS SUCCESSORS AS UNION PRESIDENT  SAID IN AN INTERVIEW LAST WEEK THE TEACHERS UNION IN RACINE IS PROOF THAT STRONG UNIONS PROVIDE MORE THAN JUST WAGE INCREASES AND PROTECTION FROM ARBITRARY BOSSES  THEY PROVIDE A KIND OF SOCIAL GLUE  MAKING MEMBERS FEEL INVESTED IN A LARGER MISSION AND PROMOTING A SENSE OF SOLIDARITY  THANKS TO THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE UNION  RACINE TEACHERS IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTOOD THE THREAT THAT GOVERNOR WALKERS PLAN POSED  HUNDREDS TROOPED TO THE CAPITAL TO RESIST IT VERY SCARED AND CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE WERE LIKE  ALL RIGHT  FINE  MR  EICK SAID  PEOPLE WHO YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WOULD PARTICIPATE GOT INVOLVED IN WEST VIRGINIA  BY CONTRAST  IT WAS YEARS BEFORE TEACHERS ROSE UP TO PROTEST THEIR ERODING STANDARD OF LIVING BEGINNING IN 2014  AFTER THE REPUBLICAN CONTROLLED LEGISLATURE REFUSED TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR HEALTH INSURANCE  FOISTING BENEFIT CUTS AND COST INCREASES ONTO PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS  THE TEACHERS UNIONS PLEADED THEIR CASE TO LAWMAKERS  BUT THE UNIONS WERE INEFFECTUAL BECAUSE THEY STRUGGLED TO RILE UP THEIR MEMBERSHIP  EVEN IN MANY COUNTIES WHERE THE UNIONS WERE ACTIVE  MOST MEMBERS WERE DISENGAGED NICOLE MCCORMICK  A MUSIC TEACHER WHO HELPS LEAD THE MERCER COUNTY LOCAL  SAID  IT WAS LIKE THE SAME 15 FACES AT EVERY MEETING  EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF MEMBERS  FOR THE REST  SHE ADDED  I WAS HAVING TO SAY THE SAME THING 25 TIMES AND THEY STILL WOULDNT UNDERSTAND  WHAT DO YOU MEAN  WHAT LEGISLATION WORSE  THE LACK OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS SET TEACHERS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER  DISTRACTING THEM FROM EXTERNAL THREATS  WITHOUT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING  NO ONE UNION CAN OPERATE AS THE EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE OF TEACHERS IN A COUNTY  IN THAT VACUUM  AT LEAST TWO UNIONS COMPETED TO SCARE UP MEMBERS THE UNIONS SPEND A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO OUT RECRUIT THE OTHER ONE  SAID JAY ONEAL  A SEVENTH GRADE ENGLISH TEACHER FROM CHARLESTON WHO WAS A LEADER OF THE PROTEST MOVEMENT MR  ONEAL AND HIS COLLEAGUES WERE REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL AT BUILDING MOMENTUM FOR THE WALKOUT THROUGH A FACEBOOK GROUP  BUT THEY WON ONLY A DOWN PAYMENT ON WHAT THEYD HOPED FOR  THE HEALTH INSURANCE ISSUE WAS DEFERRED TO A TASK FORCE THAT BEGAN PUBLIC HEARINGS LAST WEEK  NOT COINCIDENTALLY  LONG AFTER THE FERVOR HAD SUBSIDED MR  ONEAL OBSERVED THAT WEVE SEEN PEOPLE FALL OFF  NOT BE AS INVOLVED SINCE THE STRIKE WAS RESOLVED IN MARCH  POINTING TO ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH WEAK UNIONS  IT IS MUCH EASIER TO ROUSE PEOPLE FOR A SINGLE  HIGH PROFILE FIGHT THAN FOR SUSTAINED ADVOCACY  FOR THAT YOU NEED INSTITUTIONS THAT CARRY ON THE STRUGGLE WHILE WORKERS GET ON WITH THEIR DAILY LIVES I THINK SOMETIMES ITS A LITTLE GLIB FOR PEOPLE ON THE POLITICAL LEFT TO SAY WE SHOULD JUST HAVE A MORE FIRED UP BASE  SAID JOSEPH SLATER  AN EXPERT ON PUBLIC EMPLOYEE UNIONS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO COLLEGE OF LAW  WORKERS HAVE FULL TIME JOBS OF COURSE  STRONG UNIONS CAN BRING THEIR OWN BAGGAGE  LEADERS CAN GROW REMOTE FROM THEIR MEMBERSHIP  A UNIONS STRENGTH MAY GIVE IT IRRATIONAL CONFIDENCE THAT IT CAN DEFEAT THREATS THROUGH CONVENTIONAL POLITICS  LIKE ELECTIONS AND LOBBYING  RATHER THAN MORE RADICAL MEASURES  LIKE WORK STOPPAGES IN WEST VIRGINIA  BY CONTRAST  THE WEAKNESS OF THE UNIONS LEFT WORKERS NO CHOICE BUT TO TAKE THE LEAD  AND THE UNIONS WERE IN NO POSITION TO RESIST  I SAID THE UNIONS WONT START THE MOVEMENT  BUT IF IT HITS CRITICAL MASS  THEYLL HAVE TO JOIN IN  SAID RYAN FRANKENBERRY  WEST VIRGINIA DIRECTOR OF THE WORKING FAMILIES PARTY  WHO ADVISED MR  ONEAL AND HIS COLLEAGUES BUT  IN THE END  THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR A STRONG UNION IN A LONG TERM STRUGGLE AGAINST POWERFUL ANTAGONISTS  AND EVEN THE WEST VIRGINIA WALKOUT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT THE UNIONS  WHICH PRESIDED OVER AN AUTHORIZATION VOTE IN EVERY COUNTY  YOU CANT ORGANIZE A STRIKE ON FACEBOOK  EVEN IF EVERYONE SOUNDS REALLY EXCITED  SAID CATHY KUNKEL  AN ORGANIZER WITH THE PROGRESSIVE GROUP RISE UP WEST VIRGINIA WHO HELPED TEACHERS STRATEGIZE TO REALLY GET TEACHERS MARCHING IN LOCK STEP  MS  KUNKEL SAID  THEY NEEDED THE HEFT OF A UNION

ITS RELIANCE ON RESOURCE INDUSTRIES AND TOWARD IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH INDIGENOUS PEOPLES WHOSE TERRITORIES ARE IMPERILED BY ENERGY PROJECTS  YET MORE THAN HALFWAY THROUGH HIS MANDATE  HE HAS ADOPTED THE BACKWARD ENERGY AND ECONOMIC POLICIES OF HIS PREDECESSOR STEPHEN HARPER  AN ARDENT FOSSIL FUEL PROMOTER  MR  TRUDEAU HAS REVEALED HIMSELF TO BE NOT A CLIMATE CRUSADER  BUT A PIPELINE PITCHMAN WHO TELLS THE WORLD ONE THING WHILE DOING THE OPPOSITE AT HOME WITHIN A YEAR OF COMMITTING IN PARIS TO AMBITIOUS TARGETS  MR  TRUDEAU AND HIS FEDERAL LIBERAL PARTY HAD RENDERED HIS PLEDGE MEANINGLESS  THE GOVERNMENT APPROVED A PAIR OF HEAVY OIL PIPELINES AND A LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS PLANT  ITS MEMBERS SECRETLY CHEERED AS DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED  AND MOVED TOWARD RESURRECTING THE KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE   TWO OTHER PIPELINE PROJECTS WERE TERMINATED EARLIER IN MR  TRUDEAUS TERM  BUT HE CANT TAKE CREDIT  ONE WAS QUASHED IN COURT AND THE OTHER WAS CANCELED BY THE COMPANY HANGING IN THE BALANCE NOW IS THE TRANS MOUNTAIN PIPELINE EXPANSION FROM EDMONTON  ALBERTA  TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF THIS CITY  THE PROJECT  LED BY A SUBSIDIARY OF THE TEXAS BASED ENERGY COMPANY KINDER MORGAN  AND WITH INVESTMENT FROM CANADIAN BANKS  WOULD TRIPLE THE FLOW OF BITUMEN TO THE COAST TO 890 000 BARRELS A DAY AND PRODUCE A SEVENFOLD BUMP IN TANKER TRAFFIC  A HEAVY OIL SPILL COULD BE CATASTROPHIC FOR CANADAS LARGEST WILD SALMON RUN  MANY WHALE SPECIES AND BRITISH COLUMBIAS MULTIBILLION DOLLAR TOURISM INDUSTRY  THE ESTIMATED CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECT WOULD EQUATE TO ADDING ABOUT 3 MILLION CARS A YEAR TO THE ROAD  ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS HAVE WARRIORED UP THE TRUDEAU GOVERNMENT IS NOW BEING PRESSURED TO ANSWER AN ULTIMATUM BY MONTHS END FROM THE COMPANY  WHICH IS THREATENING TO QUIT THE PROJECT  SAID TO COST 7 4 BILLION CANADIAN DOLLARS  9 BILLION WHILE CAMPAIGNING  MR  TRUDEAU MADE ASSURANCES ABOUT FIXING THE FARCICAL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS FOR PROSPECTIVE ENERGY PROJECTS THAT WAS CULTIVATED BY MR  HARPERS CONSERVATIVES  THE LIBERAL GOVERNMENT LATER ANNOUNCED IT WOULD ADHERE TO THE UNITED NATIONS DECLARATION ON THE RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES  WHICH REQUIRES FREE  PRIOR AND INFORMED CONSENT FROM FIRST NATIONS WHERE AN INDUSTRIAL PROJECT THREATENS THEIR TRADITIONAL LANDS AND WATERS  CANADIANS HAD GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE HE WOULD TAKE REAL STEPS TOWARD CHANGE YET THE PRIME MINISTER WAS ENGAGING IN DOUBLESPEAK ALL ALONG  AS EARLY AS 2014  MR  TRUDEAU STATED HE WAS VERY INTERESTED IN KINDER MORGANS PIPELINE  A YEAR BEFORE  HE HAD TRUMPETED THE KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE IN A SPEECH TO EXECUTIVES AT THE CALGARY PETROLEUM CLUB  HIS BIGGEST GRIPE WITH PRIME MINISTER HARPER WAS LITTLE MORE THAN DIVISIVENESS  WHERE MR  HARPER SOUGHT TO CRIMINALIZE OPPONENTS AS ECO TERRORISTS  MR  TRUDEAUS BIG IDEA WAS TO REBRAND THE ENERGY CONVERSATION WITH FRIENDLINESS AND DIPLOMACY  IT HAS BEEN LONG EVIDENT HE WOULD STAY LOYAL TO A FOSSIL FUEL BASED ECONOMY KINDER MORGANS OPPONENTS IN BRITISH COLUMBIA  THE PROVINCE WHERE THE PIPELINE WOULD TERMINATE  FELT DUMBFOUNDED AND BETRAYED WHEN IN LATE 2016 THE TRUDEAU GOVERNMENT APPROVED THE PROJECT AND THEN DOUBLED DOWN  TENS

INITIATED PREPARATORY WORK  OPPONENTS ORGANIZED MORE MUSCULAR DEFIANCE  IN MARCH  THE ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE ARRESTED MORE THAN 170 PEOPLE WHO WERE BLOCKING KINDER MORGAN EQUIPMENT  INCLUDING INDIGENOUS DEMONSTRATORS AND THE FEDERAL GREEN PARTY LEADER ELIZABETH MAY THE COMPANY HAS NOW DEMANDED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DELIVER FINAL CERTAINTY ABOUT THE PIPELINES FUTURE BY MAY 31  THE PRIME MINISTER IMMEDIATELY CALLED EMERGENCY MEETINGS WITH HIS CABINET AND THE PREMIERS OF BRITISH COLUMBIA AND ALBERTA  WHO HAVE ANTIPODEAN HOPES FOR THE OUTCOME MR  TRUDEAU NOW HAS ONLY LIMITED OPTIONS  FORGE AHEAD  PREPARING TO USE SUSTAINED POLICE FORCE AGAINST DEMONSTRATORS AND DESIGNATING PUBLIC FUNDS TO MINIMIZE KINDER MORGANS RISK  OR LET THE PROJECT EXPIRE AND MAKE GOOD ON THE PARIS COMMITMENTS ON THE HOME FRONT  MR  TRUDEAU ASSERTS THAT PRESSING FORWARD SERVES THE NATIONAL INTEREST  HE HAS REPEATEDLY DECLARED THE PIPELINE WILL GET BUILT BY CITING A CLAUSE IN CANADAS CONSTITUTION THE GOVERNMENT COULD EMPLOY TO OVERRIDE PROVINCES FOR PROJECTS OF NATIONWIDE IMPORTANCE  YET CANADIANS LARGELY WOULDNT BENEFIT UNDER THIS SCHEME BECAUSE MOST OIL REVENUES DONT FLOW TO PUBLIC COFFERS  RATHER  INCREASINGLY TO FOREIGN COMPANIES  EVEN THE SUPPOSED ASIAN DEMAND HAS BEEN VASTLY EXAGGERATED  EXPORTING RAW BITUMEN ALSO WOULD SHIP AWAY POTENTIAL REFINERY JOBS  AND LEGAL EXPERTS ARGUE THAT SO CALLED NATIONAL INTEREST DOESNT TRUMP ABORIGINAL RIGHTS THAT ARE EQUALLY ENSHRINED IN THE CONSTITUTION BIG FOOTING BRITISH COLUMBIA AND ITS FIRST NATIONS  EVEN IF CONSTITUTIONALLY VIABLE  WOULD LIKELY DAMAGE MR  TRUDEAU POLITICALLY  IS HE WILLING TO TARNISH HIS IMAGE AND CANADAS PEACEFUL REPUTATION BY DEPLOYING THE MILITARY  HES NOW IN A FAMILIAR STANDOFF AGAINST SOME OF THE COUNTRYS MOST TENACIOUS ENVIRONMENTALISTS  REARED IN THE BIRTHPLACE OF GREENPEACE  IN THE 1990S  THE WAR IN THE WOODS PROTESTS AGAINST THE LOGGING OF OLD GROWTH TREES IN CLAYOQUOT SOUND PROMPTED MAJOR CHANGES TO PROVINCIAL FORESTRY POLICY  IT WAS ULTIMATELY NAMED A UNESCO BIOSPHERE RESERVE  FIFTEEN YEARS LATER  PITTING THE ARMY AGAINST INDIGENOUS GRANDMOTHERS AND TEENAGERS SIMPLY FOR PROTECTING THEIR WATERS AND THE EARTH COULD JEOPARDIZE 18 OF HIS PARTYS PARLIAMENTARY SEATS MR  TRUDEAU ALL THE WHILE IS KEEPING UP APPEARANCES ABROAD  LIKE RECENTLY VOWING TO REDOUBLE CLIMATE EFFORTS WITH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON OF FRANCE  THAT SMACKS OF DUPLICITY WHEN A DAY EARLIER HE OFFERED PUBLIC MONEY TO BACKSTOP THE PIPELINE  SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE INVESTMENT  THE COMPANY COULD ATTEMPT CONSTRUCTION WITH MINIMIZED RISK  AND IF THAT FAILS  HEAD HOME WHILE CASTING CANADAS POLITICIANS AS AN INEPT SCAPEGOAT  AND POTENTIALLY SETTING UP A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR LAWSUIT AGAINST CANADA UNDER NAFTA  BUT ITS A LONG SHOT FOR SURETIES SO SOON SALVAGING THE EMBATTLED PIPELINE WITH TAX DOLLARS WOULD BE FOOLISH AND WASTEFUL  IT WONT HALT CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE THAT COULD STRETCH CONSTRUCTION FOR YEARS  NOR BEAT MOUNTING LEGAL CHALLENGES BY SEVEN FIRST NATIONS  TWO CONSERVATION GROUPS AND THE CITIES OF VANCOUVER AND BURNABY  THE LAWSUITS THEMSELVES POSE AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT  CONTENDING ABORIGINAL GROUPS WERE NOT ADEQUATELY CONSULTED  ECOSYSTEMS AND DRINKING WATER COULD BE POLLUTED  AND ORCA AND OTHER ENDANGERED SPECIES WILL BE HARMED   KINDER MORGAN HAS ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED IN DISCLOSURES TO SHAREHOLDERS THAT ITS PERMITS COULD BE VOIDED WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR NOT  MR  TRUDEAU IS LEFT WITH BUT ONE VIABLE OPTION  DISCARD THE PIPELINE AND FOCUS ON GREENER PASTURES  TO CREATE JOBS  HE SHOULD RAMP UP THE

20180501,business,market,6,DURHAM  N C   DOWNTOWN JUST AINT BLACK ENOUGH FOR ME  PAUL SCOTT WROTE IN THE DURHAM HERALD SUN A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO  A MINISTER AND LOCAL NEWSPAPER COLUMNIST  MR  SCOTT WAS ECHOING A SENTIMENT VOICED BY MANY OF THE CITYS LONGTIME AFRICAN AMERICAN RESIDENTS  THE CITY CENTER DOES NOT FEEL WELCOMING TO THEM ANYMORE MY CONCERN IS THAT WHEN YOU GO DOWNTOWN ON ANY GIVEN EVENING OR ON A WEEKEND  YOU DONT SEE A WHOLE LOT OF BLACK FACES THERE  MR  SCOTT SAID LATER IN AN INTERVIEW THIS CITY HAS SEEN AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF CHANGE OVER THE PAST DECADE  ITS CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT HAS GONE FROM EMPTY AND LACKING INVESTMENT TO THRIVING  AND MORE DEVELOPMENT IS ON THE WAY AS A RESULT OF THE GROWTH  LOCAL OFFICIALS FIND THEMSELVES GRAPPLING WITH A CRISIS OVER AFFORDABLE HOUSING  BUT WHAT HAS BEEN LARGELY OVERLOOKED IS THE CULTURAL DISPLACEMENT THAT CAN ACCOMPANY RAPID URBAN CHANGE  THE SENSE THAT HOME IS NOT HOME ANYMORE  AT LEAST FOR A PORTION OF THE POPULATION IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT SOME DURHAM RESIDENTS ARE FEELING DISORIENTED  IN THE EARLY PART OF THE LAST CENTURY  THE CITY  ONCE A HUB FOR TOBACCO AND TEXTILE INDUSTRIES  WAS NATIONALLY KNOWN FOR ITS STRONG BUSINESSES OWNED BY AFRICAN AMERICANS  IT WENT BY THE MONIKER CAPITAL OF THE BLACK MIDDLE CLASS  AND THAT GROUP SURVIVED EVEN AS THE CITYS DOWNTOWN EXPERIENCED A POPULATION SHIFT TO THE SUBURBS  BY THE 1970S  THOUGH  DURHAM WAS THE POOREST OF THE THREE MAIN MUNICIPALITIES IN THE REGION  WHICH INCLUDES CHAPEL HILL AND RALEIGH  AND IT HAD DEVELOPED A REPUTATION FOR CRIME BUT PUBLIC PRIVATE INVESTMENTS JUMP STARTED SOME GROWTH A FEW YEARS AGO  JUST IN TIME FOR THE GROWING INTEREST IN URBAN LIVING  ARTISTS  PROFESSIONALS AND YOUNG FAMILIES BEGAN FLOCKING TO DURHAM  ATTRACTED TO ITS LOW HOUSING PRICES AND DOWNTOWN INFRASTRUCTURE  A BIG PART OF THE APPEAL  TOO  WAS THE CITYS RACIAL DIVERSITY  BLACKS AND WHITES EACH MAKE UP ABOUT 40 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION SINCE THEN  HOWEVER  HOUSING PRICES HAVE SKYROCKETED  INVESTORS ARE RENOVATING HOMES IN LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS NEAR THE CENTER OF TOWN AND SELLING THEM FOR SEVERAL TIMES WHAT THEY INITIALLY PAID  TOBACCO WAREHOUSES AND TEXTILE MILLS HAVE BECOME UPSCALE CONDOMINIUM AND OFFICE BUILDINGS NOW  DURHAM IS ON THE CUSP OF MAJOR NEW DEVELOPMENT  ONE OF THE BIGGEST IS ONE CITY CENTER  AN  MILLION PROJECT BY AUSTIN LAWRENCE PARTNERS  A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT FIRM BASED IN ASPEN  COLO  THE BUILDING WILL RISE 27 STORIES ABOVE DOWNTOWN AND OFFER RETAIL SPACE  OFFICES AND HIGH END RESIDENCES AND THERE ARE MANY OTHERS  INCLUDING THE DURHAM INNOVATION DISTRICT  A  MILLION PROJECT BY LONGFELLOW REAL ESTATE PARTNERS  A DEVELOPER BASED IN BOSTON  THE PROJECT CONSISTS OF 350 000 SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE AND LABORATORY SPACE  WITH GROUND FLOOR RETAIL  IN TWO SEVEN STORY BUILDINGS  ONE HAS ALREADY BEEN LEASED TO THE DUKE CLINICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE  THE BUILDINGS ARE ALMOST COMPLETE  AND EVENTUALLY THE PROJECT WILL ALSO INCLUDE A TOWER DEVOTED TO LAB SPACE  BRINGING THE DEVELOPMENT TO 900 000 SQUARE FEET NORTHWOOD RAVIN  A DEVELOPER BASED IN NORTH CAROLINA  IS BUILDING TWO PROJECTS JUST SOUTH OF DOWNTOWN  THE VAN ALEN  AN  MILLION  12 STORY BUILDING THAT WILL HOLD ROUGHLY 400 RESIDENTIAL UNITS  AND 555 MANGUM  AN 11 STORY  240 000 SQUARE FOOT OFFICE TOWER WITH GROUND FLOOR RETAIL IN TOTAL  THE PROJECTS WILL BRING MORE THAN 1 2 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE SPACE  1 500 RESIDENTIAL UNITS AND 100 000 SQUARE FEET OF RETAIL SPACE TO DURHAM THERE ARE ALREADY FAR MORE PEOPLE ON MAIN STREET HERE THAN THERE HAVE BEEN IN SEVERAL DECADES  AND THAT NUMBER WILL SOON INCREASE IMMENSELY  IN PARTICULAR  THE ADDITION OF SO MANY UPSCALE RESIDENTIAL UNITS MEANS AN ENTIRELY NEW POPULATION DOWNTOWN  LARGELY WEALTHY AND WHITE  PLUS NEW RESTAURANTS AND SERVICES CATERING TO THAT DEMOGRAPHIC BUT THE GROWTH IS MAKING SOME LONGTIME RESIDENTS UNCOMFORTABLE IVE NOTICED A LOT OF CHANGES  BUT NONE OF THEM HAVE TRULY BEEN FOR BLACK PEOPLE  IN MY OPINION  SAID VANESSA EVANS  A COMMUNITY LEADER IN THE BRAGGTOWN AREA OF DURHAM WHOSE FAMILY HAS LIVED IN THE CITY FOR GENERATIONS  DOWNTOWN DOESNT LOOK ANYTHING LIKE ME  OR LIKE IT USED TO LOOK COMMUNITY LEADERS POINT OUT THAT SEVERAL AFRICAN AMERICAN EVENTS  LIKE THE POPULAR BIMB CULTURAL ARTS FESTIVAL  HAVE BEEN MOVED TO THE CITYS OUTER FRINGES  OTHERS SAY THAT DURHAMS DIVERSITY IS STILL USED AS A SELLING POINT  BUT THAT THE CONCEPT OF WHATS CONSIDERED HIP IN THE CITY HAS BEGUN TO SHIFT WHAT MADE DURHAM COOL WAS THE RACIAL MIX  SAID DORIAN BOLDEN  OWNER OF BEYU CAFFE  A DOWNTOWN RESTAURANT  WHAT CREATED THE SPARK IS BEING REDEFINED AS A DIFFERENT KIND OF COOL THAT MAY NOT HAVE THE SAME RACIAL INCLUSION THAT WE ALL FELL IN LOVE WITH AT THE BEGINNING LONGTIME BLACK RESIDENTS FREQUENTLY ASSERT THAT ONLY A COUPLE OF BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES ARE LEFT IN THE CITY CENTER  BUT DOWNTOWN DURHAM  AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GROUP  RECENTLY DETERMINED THAT MORE THAN 60 MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES WERE IN THE AREA  ALTHOUGH MANY WERE PROFESSIONAL OFFICES NOT VISIBLE FROM THE STREET NICOLE J  THOMPSON  DOWNTOWN DURHAMS CHIEF EXECUTIVE  ALSO POINTED OUT THAT BLACKS APPEARED TO BE WELL REPRESENTED ON DOWNTOWN SIDEWALKS  I RECENTLY MADE A POINT TO COME DOWNTOWN  AS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MYSELF  AND SEE  SHE SAID  I HAD TO RAISE MY EYEBROWS  ITS NOT ALL WHITE FACES STILL  MANY OF DURHAMS AFRICAN AMERICAN RESIDENTS FEEL THEY HAVE LITTLE CONTROL OVER HOW IT TRANSFORMS CITY OFFICIALS SAY THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM  AND THAT MAINTAINING A SENSE OF INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY IS IMPORTANT TO THEM WE DONT WANT A DOWNTOWN WHERE ONLY RICH PEOPLE AND WHITE PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE  SAID JILLIAN JOHNSON  MAYOR PRO TEMPORE ON THE CITY COUNCIL  LEFT TO ITS OWN DEVICES  THIS MARKET WILL TREND TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE MOST MONEY TO SPEND  IN ORDER TO MAKE DOWNTOWN ACCESSIBLE AND COMFORTABLE  THERE HAS TO BE MORE OF AN INTENTIONAL PUSH TO MAINTAIN SOME OF THAT RACIAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC DIVERSITY BUT KATHRYN L  S  PETTIT  A RESEARCHER AT THE URBAN INSTITUTE  SAID THAT THE SOONER CITY LEADERS BEGAN TO ACT  THE BETTER  LAND COSTS CAN RISE STEEPLY WITH TIME  SHE SAID  REDUCING THE OPTIONS IF THE CITY WAITS TOO LONG TO MAKE DECISIONS THE CITY NEEDS TO EXAMINE THE BEST USES OF ITS LAND THAT WOULD BENEFIT A VARIETY OF RESIDENTS  MS  PETTIT SAID  IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR THE CITY TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE IN ALL OF ITS LAND USE DECISIONS  PARTICULARLY WITH BIG PARCELS  SHE ADDED  BECAUSE THAT CAN HELP HEAD OFF DISAGREEMENTS AND THE SENSE OF BEING LEFT OUT OTHER SOLUTIONS ARE AVAILABLE  SAID DEREK HYRA  A PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND POLICY AT AMERICAN UNIVERSITY AND THE AUTHOR OF RACE  CLASS  AND POLITICS IN THE CAPPUCCINO CITY  HE POINTED TO A PROGRAM PROPOSED BY A DISTRICT COUNCIL MEMBER IN WASHINGTON THAT WOULD PROVIDE GRANTS TO HELP LONGTIME BUSINESSES REMAIN AND STAY COMPETITIVE PROFESSOR HYRA HAS ALSO OBSERVED PROJECTS IN WHICH DEVELOPERS AGREED TO ACCOMMODATE LOCAL BUSINESSES BECAUSE OF PRESSURE FROM ACTIVISTS AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE TO GET INVOLVED  MOBILIZED  AND HAVE TO PUT PRESSURE ON DEVELOPERS AND POLITICIANS TO DIVERT MONEY TO SMALL BUSINESSES  HE SAID  IT WONT JUST NATURALLY HAPPEN

WAS IN THE WORST POSSIBLE SHAPE TO TAKE IN ONE MORE CONCERT  EXCEPT THAT THE PERFORMANCE WAS SLEEP  MAX RICHTERS EIGHT HOUR SOUNDTRACK ENGINEERED  WITH THE HELP OF SCIENTIFIC CONSULTANTS  TO PROVOKE A RELAXING NIGHT BY DOZING OFF  ID BE DOING MY JOB OUR LIVES ARE VERY DATA SATURATED NOW  MR  RICHTER SAID IN AN INTERVIEW LAST WEEK  WERE ALWAYS ON OUR SCREENS  AND MOSTLY WERE BEING SOLD STUFF  IT SQUEEZES OUT A LOT OF RICHNESS OF WHAT WE ARE A CALM  RELAXING  VERY  VERY LONG WORK LIKE HIS  HE ADDED  COULD ACT AS A SORT OF PROTEST SONG BUT SLEEP  WHICH UNFOLDED ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AT SPRING STUDIOS IN MANHATTAN AFTER RECENTLY BEING RELEASED ON STREAMING PLATFORMS FOR EASY HOME CONSUMPTION  WAS PERHAPS NOT THE MOST ROBUST PROTEST AGAINST RAMPANT MATERIALISM  FOR ONE THING  TICKETS COST   FOR ANOTHER  THE SHOW ENDED UP LOOKING LIKE A PROLONGED AD FOR BEAUTYREST  WHICH PROVIDED THE AUDIENCES MATTRESSES  TO BE DONATED LATER TO A CHARITY FOR CHILDREN WHO HAVE TROUBLE SLEEPING  MR  RICHTER SAID  AND STAMPED ITS BRAND ON EVERYTHING  LINENS  SLEEP MASKS  SWAG BAGS THE SPACE  IN A CORNER OF TRIBECA BRISTLING WITH NEW HIGH RISES  WAS TRICKED OUT LIKE AN UPSCALE DISASTER SHELTER  MARINA ABRAMOVICS GOLDBERG  A HIGH END SENSORY DEPRIVATION TREATMENT OF BACHS GOLDBERG VARIATIONS AT THE PARK AVENUE ARMORY A FEW YEARS AGO  CAME TO MIND BUT BEFORE THAT BACH PERFORMANCE  ALL BELONGINGS  EVEN WATCHES  WERE SHUT INTO LOCKERS SO THAT AUDIENCE MEMBERS COULD BE  IN THEORY  FULLY PRESENT  AT SLEEP THERE WERE NO SUCH RESTRICTIONS  AND THE DATA SATURATED LISTENERS  OSTENSIBLY APPROACHING MR  RICHTERS MAGIC MOUNTAIN TO BRIEFLY SHUN MODERNITY  OFTEN HAD THEIR PHONES OUT  BUSILY DOCUMENTING THE NIGHT IN TEXT MESSAGES AND POSTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA SOME PEOPLE STOOD IN THE CENTER AISLE TO POSE FOR

THE CITYSCAPE AS AN ALLURING BACKDROP FOR PAJAMA CLAD SELFIES  FOR SOME REASON  WATER WASNT AVAILABLE AT THE BAR I PUT AWAY MY NOTEBOOK AND TRIED TO LISTEN TO SLEEP AS MR  RICHTER INTENDED  FOR THE FIRST HALF HOUR  IT WAS JUST HIM AT THE PIANO  PLAYING A SLOW  PULSING LULLABY  HIS RHYTHMIC PRECISION WAS ADMIRABLE  GIVEN THAT HIS SCORE WAS JUST STRETCHES OF WHOLE NOTES  HE PLAYED WITH THE FOCUS OF A DYED IN THE WOOL MINIMALIST COMPOSERS FROM THAT MOVEMENT WERE MR  RICHTERS EARLIEST INSPIRATIONS  AS A BOY IN SMALL TOWN BRITAIN IN THE 1970S  HE WOULD GET RECORDS FROM HIS FAMILYS MILKMAN  AN ARTIST WHO WAS TAPPED INTO THE MUSIC OF LA MONTE YOUNG  TERRY RILEY AND PHILIP GLASS  HE FELL IN LOVE WITH SATIES FURNITURE MUSIC  AND  EVENTUALLY  THE AMBIENT SOUNDSCAPES OF BRIAN ENO ALL OF THIS FACTORED INTO SLEEP  WHICH WAS FIRST RELEASED IN 2015  BUT THE PIECE IS ALSO A HOMAGE TO BACHS GOLDBERG VARIATIONS   THE TWO WORKS HAVE THE SAME NUMBER OF SECTIONS  WHILE AWARE THAT THE PIECES ORIGIN STORY IS APOCRYPHAL  MR  RICHTER WAS INTRIGUED THAT THE GOLDBERGS WERE SUPPOSEDLY WRITTEN FOR A COUNT WITH INSOMNIA BACH  IT NEEDS BE SAID  THIS AINT  SLEEP IS RIFE WITH THE HALLMARKS OF MR  RICHTERS STYLE  A CLARITY THAT CAN SEEM LIKE SUPERFICIALITY  AN EARNESTNESS AND EMOTIONALITY THAT OFTEN COME OFF AS MORE ERSATZ AND MANIPULATIVE THAN PERSONAL  AND ITS DIFFICULT TO BUY INTO AN EIGHT HOUR EXERCISE IN MINDFULNESS WHEN  AGAINST MR  RICHTERS BEST INTENTIONS  IT OPENED ITSELF TO BEING MORE OF A SOCIAL MEDIA SENSATION ASKED WHETHER THE PERFORMANCE COULD FALL VICTIM TO THE VERY THING IT WAS TRYING TO RESIST  MR  RICHTER SAID  ITS FRAUGHT WITH IRONIES  BUT HE SAID HE ALSO HOPED THAT THE PIECE COULD HELP A COMMUNITY BUILD TOWARD A SILENCE SILENCE DID REIGN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT  WHEN THE PIECE REACHED ITS ENCHANTING APEX  AROUND ME PEOPLE SLEPT  OR LAY AWAKE AS IF IN A TRANCE  THE LOFTS AND OFFICE TOWERS OF TRIBECA RESTED  TOO  THERE WERE NO STARS IN THE SKY  BUT THE LIGHTS TWINKLED IN THE CHOPPY WAVES OF THE HUDSON RIVER I FELL ASLEEP  AND DREAMED THAT SOMEONE WAS WALKING AMONG THE MATTRESSES  HANDING OUT WATER AROUND 5 30 IN THE MORNING  THE SUN BEGAN TO RISE  GRADUALLY FILLING THE ROOM WITH LIGHT AS THE SLEEP ORCHESTRA PLAYED OBVIOUS MUSIC TO MATCH IT  AN INCREASINGLY LOUD  RADIANT MAJOR CHORD  IF THE EARLIER LULLABY MUSIC HAD BEEN PURPOSEFULLY LOW AND MANTRALIKE  BASED ON SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INTO WHAT PUTS US TO SLEEP  THIS GENTLE REVEILLE ALSO HAD AN EXPERIMENTAL BASIS  HIGHER FREQUENCIES WAKE US UP AS PEOPLE AWOKE  THEY GRABBED THEIR PHONES TO CAPTURE THE SUNRISE  A COUPLE KISSED AND SAID GOOD MORNING  AS IF AT HOME AND NOT SURROUNDED BY 100 STRANGERS SLEEP ENDED WITH A FADE OUT  IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY THE VOICE OF A BEAUTYREST STAFF

WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA NOWHERE IS THAT TRUER THAN IN WASHINGTON  WHICH SENT  BILLION IN GOODS TO CHINA LAST YEAR  MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE  A CONGRESSIONAL RACE HERE HAS BECOME A CRUCIAL TEST OF WHETHER MR  TRUMPS UPENDING OF THE NORMS OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE WILL COME AT THE EXPENSE OF REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES THE SPAT WITH BEIJING HAS RATTLED THE STATES JUGGERNAUT AEROSPACE INDUSTRY  AS WORKERS AND BUSINESS OWNERS RECKON WITH THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEIR LIVELIHOOD COULD BE AT RISK  BOEING SHARES ECONOMIC DOMINANCE WITH GIANTS LIKE AMAZON AND MICROSOFT  BUT TRADE STILL SUPPORTS 40

ESTIMATE  THEY ARE WONDERING AND WORRYING HOW ITS GOING TO PLAY OUT THAT ANXIETY IS PARTICULARLY ACUTE IN THE EIGHTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT  A COMMA SHAPED EXPANSE THAT WILL HOLD ONE OF THE MOST CLOSELY WATCHED MIDTERM RACES IN NOVEMBER AS THE DEMOCRATS BATTLE TO WIN BACK THE HOUSE  SEVERAL POLITICAL HANDICAPPERS RATE THE RACE AS A TOSSUP THE DISTRICTS QUIRKY BOUNDARY  WHICH ENCOMPASSES THE VAST AIRPLANE MAKING ECOSYSTEM TO THE WEST AND THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF CHERRY AND APPLE FARMS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CASCADE MOUNTAINS  MAKES THE TERRITORY UNIQUELY VULNERABLE TO THE PRESIDENTS ACTIONS ON TRADE  BOEING IS PROBABLY THE AMERICAN COMPANY WITH THE MOST RIDING ON A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP WITH BEIJING CHINA IS PROJECTED TO BUY MORE THAN 7 000 PLANES WORTH AROUND  TRILLION IN THE NEXT 20 YEARS  MORE THAN BOEINGS CURRENT BACKLOG FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD  MOST COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT IN CHINA ARE MADE BY BOEING  THE COMPANY SAYS  BUT IF THE TRADE PRESSURES ESCALATE  CHINA COULD CHOOSE TO AWARD MORE WORK TO EUROPES AIRBUS FOR NOW  BEIJING HAS THREATENED TO RETALIATE WITH TARIFFS ON SOME AIRPLANES  INCLUDING OLDER 737 MODELS MADE IN THE RENTON FACTORY WHERE MR  CESMAT WORKS  WHICH IS JUST OUTSIDE THE DISTRICT CHINA KNEW EXACTLY WHERE TO TARGET  SAID KIM SCHRIER  THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE WHO HAS BUILT THE BIGGEST CAMPAIGN WAR CHEST AHEAD OF THE AUG  7 PRIMARY  THEYRE TARGETING DISTRICTS WHERE THIS COULD BE PROBLEMATIC FOR REPUBLICANS MS  SCHRIER IS AMONG HALF A DOZEN OR SO DEMOCRATS GUNNING FOR A SEAT THAT BECAME CATNIP FOR THE PARTY THE MOMENT THAT THE SEVEN TERM REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT  DAVE REICHERT  ANNOUNCED HIS RETIREMENT IN SEPTEMBER  DESPITE MR  REICHERTS SUCCESS  THE DISTRICT FAVORED HILLARY CLINTON BY THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS OVER MR  TRUMP  AND IT WENT TWICE FOR BARACK OBAMA  MS  SCHRIER  A PEDIATRICIAN AND FIRST TIME CANDIDATE  HAS BEEN HAMMERING DINO ROSSI  THE LIKELY REPUBLICAN NOMINEE  ON THE TARIFF ISSUE THESE TARIFFS ARE A DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE POLICIES OF A PRESIDENT YOU HELPED ELECT  DONT YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY  SHE TWEETED TO MR  ROSSI LAST MONTH MR  ROSSI  A FORMER STATE SENATOR  IS CAREFUL TO NOTE THAT THE BLUSTER COULD BE PART OF MR  TRUMPS NEGOTIATING STYLE  BUT HE SAID HE UNDERSTOOD WHY EVERYONE WAS SO WORRIED  YOU REALLY CANT GET DOWN TO A TRADE WAR  IN THE END IT WILL BE VERY DISRUPTIVE  HE SAID IN AN INTERVIEW  HOPEFULLY THIS IS MORE POSTURING THAN ANYTHING BUT VOTERS IN THE DISTRICT SAY THE ESCALATING TRADE DRAMA HAS ALREADY BEGUN TO COMPLICATE THEIR DAILY LIVES  COMPANIES THAT SUPPLY CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS HAVE SUSPENDED ORDERS  WAITING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO METAL PRICES  EMPLOYEES AT A BUILDER OF TRUCK COMPONENTS SAY MANAGERS HAVE BEEN HASTILY REASSESSING SUPPLY CHAINS THAT RUN THROUGH CHINA AND MEXICO  A LOCAL HARD CIDER BREWER IS RECONSIDERING AN EXPANSION AFTER THE STEEL AND ALUMINUM TARIFFS MADE NEW TANKS AND CANS MORE EXPENSIVE AND AT BOEING  A COMPANY THAT EMPLOYS GRANDFATHERS NEXT TO GRANDDAUGHTERS AND HAS INTRODUCED GENERATIONS OF WASHINGTONIANS TO THEIR SPOUSES  THE UNEASE HAS BEEN EVIDENT FROM THE EXECUTIVE SUITE TO THE FACTORY FLOOR MR  TRUMPS HARD LINE ON TRADE DIDNT USED TO INSPIRE SO MUCH TEETH GRINDING AMONG BOEING WORKERS  A LOT OF UNION MECHANICS WERE HAPPY LAST YEAR WHEN HE PULLED OUT OF THE TRANS PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP  WHICH WOULD HAVE REINFORCED THE NATIONS EMBRACE OF FREE TRADE  AND THE PRESIDENT EARNED A LOT OF FANS IN WASHINGTON WHEN HE CRITICIZED THE COMPANY ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL IN 2015 FOR SETTING UP A NEW PLANT OUTSIDE SHANGHAI  SAYING IT WOULD END UP TAKING A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF JOBS AWAY FROM THE UNITED STATES JIM MCKENZIE  A UNION MACHINERY REPAIRMAN  REMEMBERED THAT COMMENT WHEN  SEVERAL MONTHS AGO  HE CAME ACROSS A PACKAGE OF DORSAL FIN PARTS AT THE BOEING PLANT IN AUBURN WHERE HE WORKS  MR  MCKENZIE PULLED BACK THE BUBBLE WRAP AND SAW A LABEL THAT MADE HIM FEEL AS IF HE WERE SINKING INTO QUICKSAND  BOEING CHINA WE DRILL IT AND ASSEMBLE IT  BUT THEY SHIP THE PARTS IN FROM CHINA  MR  MCKENZIE SAID  THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED HERE FOR 25 YEARS MAKING THOSE PARTS  AND THEYRE PROUD OF THAT BUT MR  MCKENZIE  56  ISNT EAGER TO BLOW UP THE BEIJING RELATIONSHIP  CHINA WILL JUST BUY ALL THEIR PLANES FROM AIRBUS  HE SAID  LEANING HIS CHAIR BACK AGAINST A WALL IN THE MACHINISTS UNION HALL IN AUBURN HE DOESNT HAVE MUCH HOPE THAT MR  TRUMP WILL DO ANYTHING TO STOP BOEING FROM SETTING UP SHOP IN CHINA  HE SAW HOW CARRIER SHIPPED WORK FROM INDIANAPOLIS TO MEXICO EVEN THOUGH THE PRESIDENT HAD RAILED AGAINST THE MOVE  IN BOEINGS CASE  MR  MCKENZIE SAID  HIRING SOME CHINESE WORKERS MIGHT BE UNAVOIDABLE  YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE THEM JOBS TO SELL THEM AIRPLANES  HE SAID MS  SCHRIER RECENTLY WON THE ENDORSEMENT OF THE MACHINISTS UNION  WHICH REPRESENTS MORE THAN 26 000 BOEING WORKERS  MR  CESMAT  27  PLANS TO VOLUNTEER FOR HER CAMPAIGN  SHE PLEDGED TO SUPPORT OUR JOBS  HE SAID BOEINGS POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE DONATED  000 TO MR  REICHERTS CAMPAIGN  BUT HASNT CONTRIBUTED TO ANY CANDIDATES VYING TO SUCCEED HIM  ACCORDING TO THE CENTER FOR RESPONSIVE POLITICS  A NONPARTISAN RESEARCH GROUP  IT DID DONATE  000 TO CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS  WHO IS FACING A STRONG DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGE IN HER QUEST FOR RE ELECTION IN WASHINGTONS FIFTH DISTRICT THE FEAR OVER TRADE TENSIONS HAS SPREAD BEYOND BOEINGS HULKING FACTORIES  ALL THE WAY TO SCHILLING CIDER  A HARD CIDER COMPANY FOUNDED HERE FIVE YEARS AGO BY TWO FRIENDS  MARK KORNEI AND COLIN SCHILLING  THE BUSINESS GREW QUICKLY  THANKS IN PART TO THE STATES ABUNDANT APPLE ORCHARDS  BUT NOW ITS STARING DOWN AN UNCOMFORTABLE NEW REALITY THE COMPANY THAT SELLS MR  KORNEI STAINLESS STEEL TANKS TOLD HIM RECENTLY THAT PRICES FOR ITS RAW MATERIALS MIGHT RISE BY 20 PERCENT  A SINGLE TANK COSTS AROUND  000  HE HAS ALSO HEARD FROM THE MANUFACTURER OF HIS ALUMINUM CANS THAT PRICES COULD INCREASE BY 10 PERCENT  MR  KORNEI WILL BUY 11 MILLION OF THEM THIS YEAR  SO THAT UPTICK ALONE COULD COST HIM MORE THAN  000  HE SAID STIRRING THE POT UNNECESSARILY DOESNT HELP BUSINESS WHATSOEVER  MR  KORNEI SAID  GIVE US A STEADY SET OF RULES SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO MR  ROSSI ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SOME OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS AND DOES CAN AT TIMES MAKE IT HARDER FOR HIM ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL  BUT HE HAS RAISED MORE THAN  MILLION  ABOUT TWICE AS MUCH AS MS  SCHRIER THE REPUBLICAN TAX CUTS ARE A BIG SELLING POINT FOR MR  ROSSI  WHO HAS A READY FIGURE FOR EXACTLY HOW MUCH A TYPICAL HOUSEHOLD WILL SAVE BECAUSE OF THE LAW  357  THATS REAL MONEY  HES ALSO COUNTING ON A

20180505,business,economy,9,TOKYO  HOW MUCH DOES AN ARTIST OWE HIS MUSE LAST MONTH A MODEL WHO POSED FOR NOBUYOSHI ARAKI  JAPANS MOST NOTORIOUS PHOTOGRAPHER  ACCUSED HIM OF EXPLOITING AND BULLYING HER FOR 16 YEARS NOW  WITH A NEW YORK EXHIBITION FEATURING THE WORK OF MR  ARAKI  KNOWN FOR HIS SEXUALLY EXPLICIT IMAGES OF WOMEN  THE ACCUSATIONS ARE RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POWER DYNAMICS BETWEEN A PHOTOGRAPHER AND HIS SUBJECT IN A BLOG POST PUBLISHED IN JAPANESE IN EARLY APRIL AFTER THE INCOMPLETE ARAKI OPENED AT THE MUSEUM OF SEX IN MANHATTAN  THE MODEL  KAORI  WHO USES ONLY HER FIRST NAME  SAID THAT OVER THEIR WORKING RELATIONSHIP  MR  ARAKI NEVER SIGNED HER TO A PROFESSIONAL CONTRACT  IGNORED HER REQUESTS FOR PRIVACY DURING PHOTO SHOOTS  NEGLECTED TO INFORM HER WHEN PICTURES OF HER WERE PUBLISHED OR DISPLAYED  AND OFTEN DID NOT PAY HER HE TREATED ME LIKE AN OBJECT  SHE WROTE IN AN INTERVIEW IN TOKYO  KAORI  WHO STOPPED WORKING WITH MR  ARAKI TWO YEARS AGO  SAID SHE FELT EMPOWERED TO SPEAK OUT BY THE INTERNATIONAL RECKONING ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT KNOWN AS THE  METOO MOVEMENT KAORI  WHO BEGAN POSING FOR MR  ARAKI  NOW 77  IN HER EARLY 20S  HAS NOT ACCUSED HIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT  INSTEAD  SHE SAID SHE FELT EMOTIONALLY BULLIED BY AN ARTIST WHO NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED HER AS A CREATIVE PARTNER I WANT THEM TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST BETWEEN ME AND ARAKI  KAORI SAID LAST MONTH  I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO SPEAK OUT  PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW  AND THEY SHOULD LOOK  MR  ARAKI DECLINED REPEATED REQUESTS TO COMMENT MR  ARAKIS WORK HAS LONG IGNITED CONTROVERSY  GIVEN THE PROVOCATIVE NATURE OF HIS IMAGES  WHICH INCLUDE PHOTOGRAPHS OF NUDE WOMEN BOUND UP IN A JAPANESE TECHNIQUE KNOWN AS KINBAKU BI  HE HAS BEEN FINED ON OBSCENITY CHARGES IN JAPAN  AND WHILE SOME CRITICS CONSIDER HIM A MAESTRO  OTHERS DEEM HIS WORK PORNOGRAPHY MAGGIE MUSTARD  CO CURATOR OF THE MUSEUM OF SEX EXHIBITION  SAID KAORIS ALLEGATIONS WERE FORCING A NEW CONVERSATION ABOUT MODELS RIGHTS THIS GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO A MUSE  AND I USE THAT WORD WITH AIR QUOTES  WHEN SHE DOESNT HAVE A CONTRACT OR A SENSE OF ECONOMIC OR LEGAL AGENCY ABOUT HOW HER IMAGE WAS USED  MS  MUSTARD SAID IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW MS  MUSTARD ADDED THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN WITH KAORI AND WOULD INCORPORATE HER COMMENTS INTO THE EXHIBITIONS PROGRAMMING MATERIALS  ALREADY  THE WALL TEXT MENTIONS ANOTHER MODELS ANONYMOUS ALLEGATIONS OF INAPPROPRIATE SEXUAL CONTACT BY MR  ARAKI  NOTING THAT THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING ARAKIS WORK HAS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BEEN ABOUT RECEPTION AND MEANING  AND FAR LESS ABOUT THE ISSUES OF CONSENT AND THE POTENTIAL ABUSES OF POWER THAT CAN BE AT THE FOUNDATION OF ARTISTIC PRACTICE AND ARTISTIC PRODUCTION THE CONTENTIOUS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ARTIST AND MODEL GOES BACK CENTURIES  WITH MEN LIKE PICASSO OR SCHIELE KNOWN FOR MISTREATING WOMEN  MORE RECENTLY  POTENTIAL PORTRAIT MODELS FOR CHUCK CLOSE HAVE ACCUSED HIM OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT ART HISTORIANS ARGUE THAT IT MIGHT BE TIME FOR ARTISTS TO RETHINK THE BASIS ON WHICH THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE BUILT  MODELS SHOULD HAVE MORE AGENCY IN TERMS OF AUTHORSHIP OF THE WORK ITSELF  SAID REBECCA ZORACH  A PROFESSOR OF ART HISTORY AT NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY THE ART WORLD HAS A TENDENCY TO ERASE WOMEN AS MAKERS  AND HISTORICALLY IT JUST HAPPENS OVER AND OVER AGAIN  SHE SAID IN JAPAN  KAORIS DISCLOSURES COME AS WOMEN ARE JUST STARTING TO RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT MALE POWER  SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT LAST YEAR  WHEN ONE OF JAPANS BEST KNOWN TELEVISION JOURNALISTS WAS ACCUSED OF RAPE  HIS ACCUSER RECEIVED ONLY A SMATTERING OF ATTENTION IN THE JAPANESE MEDIA  LAST MONTH AFTER A TELEVISION REPORTER ANONYMOUSLY ASSERTED THAT A HIGH LEVEL CIVIL SERVANT IN THE FINANCE MINISTRY HAD SEXUALLY HARASSED SEVERAL WOMEN  THE OFFICIAL RESIGNED  ALTHOUGH HE HAS DENIED THE CHARGES  THE MINISTRY HAS ACKNOWLEDGED HE HARASSED A REPORTER IN THIS STAUNCHLY PATRIARCHAL CULTURE  WOMEN ARE OFTEN SUBSERVIENT TO MEN  JAPAN CONSISTENTLY RANKS LOW AMONG DEVELOPED COUNTRIES ON GENDER EQUALITY IN HEALTH  EDUCATION AND THE ECONOMY AND HAS ONE OF THE WORLDS WORST RECORDS FOR WOMEN IN POLITICS FOR MODELS WORKING IN JAPANS ART WORLD  IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE DEMANDS OF A MALE ARTIST I CAN IMAGINE THAT AS A MALE PHOTOGRAPHER WHO IS MORE THAN 70 YEARS OLD  HE UNCONSCIOUSLY HAS THE PERSPECTIVE TOWARDS WOMEN THAT HE CAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS  SAID YUKIE KAMIYA  HEAD OF THE JAPAN SOCIETY GALLERY IN NEW YORK  SPEAKING OF MR  ARAKI  MALE POWER IS SUCH A COMMON UNDERSTANDING  AND WOMEN DONT HAVE MUCH OF A VOICE KAORI  WHO TRAINED IN PARIS AS A DANCER  BEGAN POSING FOR MR  ARAKI AFTER MEETING HIM AT A PARTY IN 2001 SHE SAID HE PAID HER 100 000 YEN  ABOUT   TO POSE IN THE STUDIO WEARING A KIMONO OR PERFORMING DANCES THAT MR  ARAKI WOULD PHOTOGRAPH  FOR NUDE PROJECTS  HE TOOK HER TO SO CALLED LOVE HOTELS AND PAID HER ABOUT 50 000 YEN FOR EACH ASSIGNMENT BUT SHE SAID HE ALSO CALLED HER FOR IMPROMPTU  UNPAID SESSIONS WHERE HE TOOK PHOTOS WHILE SHE WALKED IN A PARK OR SAT IN A BAR AT HIS COMMAND IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE A LIVING  ASKED HOW SHE SUPPLEMENTED HER INCOME  KAORI DEMURRED  I DONT WANT TO SAY  SHE SAID IN PUBLIC  MR  ARAKI DESCRIBED HER AS HIS MUSE  BUT SHE SAID HE DID NOT TELL HER WHEN OR WHERE THE WORK WOULD BE PUBLISHED OR EXHIBITED  AND SHE HAD NO SAY IN HOW THE IMAGES WERE COMPOSED  FOR HIM  A MUSE MEANS SOMEONE WHO DOESNT SPEAK OR HAVE ANY OF HER OWN OPINIONS AND JUST KEEPS OBEYING HIS ORDERS  SHE SAID EARLY ON  THE TWO DID HAVE A CONSENSUAL SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP  KAORI SAID DURING ONE PHOTO SESSION  SHE BALKED WHEN HE SNAPPED POLAROID PICTURES OF HER AND SOLD EACH INDIVIDUALLY WITHOUT PAYING HER ANY ROYALTIES  THAT MONEY THAT HE EARNED IS BASED ON MY CONTRIBUTION  KAORI SAID HE SAYS  I AM ARAKI  AND YOU MUST BE HAPPY AND HONORED THAT I AM TAKING A PICTURE OF YOU  SHE SAID KAZUKO ITO  A LAWYER WHOM KAORI CONSULTED LAST NOVEMBER  SAID KAORI TOLD HER THAT AFTER NUDE PHOTOS APPEARED WITHOUT HER PERMISSION  A STALKER BROKE INTO HER HOME  KAORI ASKED THE LAWYER FOR HELP OBTAINING SOME RIGHTS TO THE PHOTOS  BUT MS  ITO SAID THAT SUCH DISPUTES WERE VERY RARE IN JAPAN AND THAT SHE WAS UNLIKELY TO WIN IN COURT MS  ITO SAID SHE HAD HEARD SIMILAR COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER MODELS FOR MR  ARAKI OF COURSE  POWER INEQUITIES BETWEEN ARTISTS AND MODELS ARE NOT UNIQUE TO HIM  THERE HAS BEEN NO PUBLIC DISCOURSE ABOUT THIS STRUCTURAL PROBLEM WITHIN THE INDUSTRY AND THE PHOTOGRAPHER MODEL RELATIONSHIP  SAID MICHIO HAYASHI  A PROFESSOR OF ART HISTORY AT SOPHIA UNIVERSITY IN TOKYO KAORI DESCRIBED ONE INCIDENT WHEN FOREIGN PHOTOGRAPHERS CAME TO OBSERVE MR  ARAKI AS HE TOOK PICTURES OF HER  SHE DID NOT WANT TO APPEAR NUDE IN FRONT OF STRANGERS  SHE SAID  BUT MR  ARAKI TOLD HER  THEY ARENT HERE TO PHOTOGRAPH YOU  THEYRE HERE TO PHOTOGRAPH ME BUT WHEN PICTURES FROM THAT SESSION CAME OUT IN PRINT  KAORI APPEARED IN THEM  NAKED  HE INVITED MANY PHOTOGRAPHERS INTO THE STUDIO AND HE ORDERED ME TO SPREAD MY LEGS IN FRONT OF THAT BIG AUDIENCE  SHE SAID  I DIDNT LIKE THAT STILL  IT TOOK HER A LONG TIME TO QUIT AS MR  ARAKIS MODEL  SHE STARTED WORKING WITH HIM WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG  AND HE WAS ALREADY FAMOUS  WHEN HE WAS HOSPITALIZED  SHE DID NOT WANT TO ABANDON HIM LOOKING BACK NOW  EVERYTHING WAS EXCESSIVE AND EXTREME  SHE WROTE ON HER BLOG  SOMETHING IN ME WAS NUMB  HE ASKED ME TO DO ABNORMAL THINGS  AND I DID THEM AS IF THEY WERE NORMAL  AT ONE POINT  SHE BECAME SUICIDAL BY 2015  THE RELATIONSHIP HAD SOURED SO BADLY THAT MR  ARAKI INSISTED SHE SIGN A DOCUMENT VOWING NOT TO DEFAME HIM OR HIS BUSINESS  IN 2016  KAORI  WHO BY THEN WAS RUNNING HER OWN BALLET SCHOOL  STOPPED WORKING WITH HIM WHEN SHE REQUESTED THAT HE STOP REPUBLISHING OR EXHIBITING SOME PHOTOGRAPHS OF HER  HE WARNED IN A MARCH 2017 LETTER THAT SHE HAD NO RIGHTS  ALL MODELS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL FOR UNLIMITED USE OF THE WORK  HE WROTE IN THE LETTER  SEEN BY THE NEW YORK TIMES  I WILL DECIDE WHICH PUBLICATION  WHICH EXHIBITION  WHEN TO PUBLISH AND WHAT KIND OF PRODUCTS I WILL GIVE PERMISSION TO USE MY WORK  ITS ALL UP TO ME KAORI IS NOT THE ONLY MODEL TO HAVE OBJECTED TO MR  ARAKI S DISTRIBUTION OF PHOTOS  IN AN INTERVIEW  ANOTHER WOMAN WHO OCCASIONALLY MODELED FOR HIM BETWEEN 2003 AND 2013  WHO REQUESTED ANONYMITY BECAUSE SHE DID NOT WANT HER FAMILY TO KNOW SHE HAD POSED  SAID THAT WHEN FRIENDS DISCOVERED NUDE PHOTOS OF HER ONLINE THAT SHE HAD NOT KNOWN ABOUT  SHE ASKED MR  ARAKI TO TAKE THEM DOWN  I DONT UNDERSTAND THE INTERNET  HE TOLD HER THE MODEL SAID A GALLERY THAT REPRESENTS MR  ARAKI  TAKA ISHII IN TOKYO  EVENTUALLY REMOVED THE IMAGES FROM VARIOUS WEBSITES AS FOR KAORI  SHE HAD STARTED TO MOVE ON WITH THE SUPPORT OF A NEW PARTNER  BUT WHEN  METOO BEGAN AND THE MUSEUM OF SEX MOUNTED ITS ARAKI RETROSPECTIVE  THEY INSPIRED HER TO GO PUBLIC MANY OF THE COMMENTS ON HER BLOG OFFERED ENCOURAGEMENT AND CALLED HER COURAGEOUS  IT MUST HAVE BEEN A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE  ONE COMMENTATOR WROTE KAORI SAID SHE DID NOT EXPECT AN APOLOGY FROM MR  ARAKI  AND SHE IS NOT ASKING THE MUSEUM OF SEX TO REMOVE THE THREE PHOTOS OF HER IT IS DISPLAYING THE WORK  SHE SAID  SHOULD SERVE AS A REMINDER  ALL SHE WANTS  SHE SAID  IS FOR VISITORS TO KNOW MY SAD BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENC

TEAMS IN THE LEAGUE STRUGGLING TO MAKE A PROFIT IN A GIVEN YEAR  IT IS UNCLEAR IF OWNERS ARE WILLING TO RAISE THE CAP AND RISK FURTHER FINANCIAL INSTABILITY PENNY TOLER  THE SPARKS GENERAL MANAGER

20180505,politics,trump,1,WE IN THE COMMENTARIAT COMPLAIN ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP  BUT WERE LOCKED IN A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM NEWS ORGANIZATIONS  ESPECIALLY CABLE TELEVISION CHANNELS  FEED OFF TRUMP  LIKE OXPECKERS ON A RHINOS BACK  FOR HE IS PART OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL IN 2018  AS LONG AS OUR FOCUS IS ON TRUMP  AUDIENCES FOLLOW ITS NOT OPTIMAL TO HAVE AS PRESIDENT AN AUTHORITARIAN WHO DENOUNCES JOURNALISTS AS ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE  BUT HE HAS GIVEN US A SENSE OF MISSION AND A TRUMP BUMP  EVERY TIME HE DENOUNCES US WE GET MORE SUBSCRIPTIONS IF YOURE READING THIS  PRESIDENT TRUMP  ID APPRECIATE A GOOD  THUNDEROUS EXCORIATION  YOUVE GONE AFTER MAGGIE HABERMAN  DON LEMON AND CHUCK TODD  BUT YOUVE PUBLICLY DENOUNCED ME ONLY ONCE  AND SO INCOHERENTLY THAT I COULDNT PRINT OUT A QUOTE TO IMPRESS MY KIDS  NEXT TIME YOURE ON TWITTER  HOW ABOUT FIRING OFF SOMETHING CONCISE LIKE  CRACKPOT KRISITOFFF IS THE WORST LYING REPORTER AT THE FAILING NYTIMES EVER YET I WORRY THAT OUR NATIONAL NONSTOP FOCUS ON TRUMP IS HELPING TO USHER AMERICA INTO A HOLE  A TRUMP OBSESSION  THE DANGER IS THAT TRUMP SUCKS UP ALL THE OXYGEN  SO THAT OTHER ISSUES DONT GET ADEQUATE ATTENTION WHILE I HAVE YOU HERE  I WANTED TO REMIND YOU THAT YOU CAN SIGN UP FOR MY TWICE WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE IN AMERICA TODAY  ITS ALL TRUMP  ALL THE TIME  WERE COLLECTIVELY ADDICTED TO HIM  THE NONSTOP SCANDALS AND OUTRAGES SUCK US IN  THEY AMOUNT TO TRUMP PORN AS PRESIDENT  TRUMP IS ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT  BUT THERES SO MUCH ELSE HAPPENING AS WELL  SOME 65 000 AMERICANS WILL DIE THIS YEAR OF DRUG OVERDOSES  AMERICAN LIFE EXPECTANCY HAS FALLEN FOR TWO YEARS IN A ROW  GUNS CLAIM A LIFE EVERY 15 MINUTES AND THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED IS RISING AGAIN EVEN AS A CHILD IN THE U S  IS 70 PERCENT MORE LIKELY TO DIE BEFORE ADULTHOOD THAN ONE IN OTHER ADVANCED NATIONS  THOSE ISSUES ARE RATHER MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE QUESTION OF WHETHER STORMY DANIELS SLEPT WITH TRUMP OR LOOK ABROAD  IN MYANMAR  THE GOVERNMENT IS ENGAGING IN WHAT MANY BELIEVE TO BE A GENOCIDE AGAINST THE ROHINGYA MINORITY  GAZA IS ERUPTING  AND THERES HEIGHTENED THREAT OF A NEW WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST  THE U S  HAS BEEN COMPLICIT IN SAUDI ARABIAN WAR CRIMES IN YEMEN  THE CARNAGE IN SYRIA CONTINUES THE WORLDS PROGRESS AGAINST MALARIA  WHICH KILLS ALMOST ONE PERSON A MINUTE  HAS STALLED  A FIFTH OF CHILDREN UNDER 5 WORLDWIDE ARE STUNTED FROM MALNUTRITION  BILL GATES AND OTHERS WARN THAT ONE OF OUR TOP RISKS IS A PANDEMIC FOR WHICH WE ARE ILL PREPARED PROGRESSIVE SNOBS LIKE ME BEMOAN TRUMPS INATTENTION TO THESE GLOBAL ISSUES  BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT WE DONT PAY ATTENTION  EITHER  AT COCKTAIL PARTIES  ON CABLE TELEVISION  AT THE DINNER TABLE  AT THE WATER COOLER  ALL WE TALK ABOUT THESE DAYS IS TRUMP  SO WE COMPLAIN ABOUT TRUMP BEING INSULAR AND PAROCHIAL  BUT WEVE BECOME INSULAR AND PAROCHIAL AS WELL  WEVE CAUGHT THE CONTAGION THAT WE MOCK IM ADDICTED MYSELF  WHICH IS WHY I WRITE SO MUCH ABOUT TRUMP  OR CATCH MYSELF ON A DATE NIGHT WITH MY WIFE ENGAGING IN HORRIFIED CONVERSATION ABOUT TRUMP IN FAIRNESS  THERES GOOD REASON WERE ALL TRUMP ADDICTS  PRESIDENT TRUMP TRULY IS THE STORY IN AMERICA TODAY  HE IS SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERMINING AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS AND NORMS THAT UNDERLIE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT  COURTS  LAW ENFORCEMENT  JOURNALISM  THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY  TRUTH  HE IS ALSO BEING INVESTIGATED FOR POSSIBLY OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE AND COLLUDING WITH A FOREIGN POWERS ATTACK ON OUR ELECTORAL SYSTEM  EPIC BATTLES WILL FOLLOW TWO THOUSAND YEARS FROM NOW  HISTORIANS MAY BE LECTURING ON TRUMP THE WAY THEY NOW DISCUSS  SAY  THE CHALLENGE TO ROMAN INSTITUTIONS FROM CALIGULA SO IM NOT ARGUING THAT WE AVERT OUR EYES FROM TRUMP OR MUTE OUR CRITICISM  FAR FROM IT  BUT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SPARE BANDWIDTH FOR GENOCIDE IN MYANMAR  OPIOIDS IN AMERICA AND SO ON IT WOULD ALSO BE USEFUL IF WE RECOGNIZED THAT THE BIGGEST TRUMP SCANDALS ARE NOT WHAT HE SAYS  BUT WHAT HE DOES HIS TWEETS AGAINST IMMIGRANTS MAY BE CRUEL  BUT HIS ACTIONS ARE CRUELER  PARTICULARLY THE PATTERN OF TEARING CHILDREN AWAY FROM THEIR REFUGEE PARENTS AT THE BORDER AND SENDING THEM TO FOSTER CARE  AND HIS EFFORTS TO CURB REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH PROGRAMS  WHICH WILL LEAVE MORE WOMEN DYING AGONIZING DEATHS FROM CERVICAL CANCER  AND HIS LIFTING OF ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS  CAUSING MORE INFANTS IN FARM STATES TO SUFFER BRAIN DAMAGE FROM THE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANYS NERVE GAS PESTICIDE IN OTHER WORDS  THE BIGGEST TRUMP SCANDALS ARENT THOSE UNFOLDING IN WASHINGTON  BUT THOSE DEVASTATING THE LIVES OF THE POOR AND VULNERABLE IN DISTANT AMERICAN TOWNS THERES SOME DANGER  I THINK  THAT PROGRESSIVES COME TO CARE PRIMARILY ABOUT ISSUES WHERE TRUMP IS INVOLVED  ALLOWING HIM TO DEFINE THE AGENDA  FOR EXAMPLE  THE BEST SINGLE WAY TO BREAK CYCLES OF POVERTY IS PROBABLY WITH EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS FOR AT RISK KIDS  BUT BECAUSE TRUMP DOESNT CARE ABOUT THIS  LIBERALS DONT SEEM MUCH INTERESTED  EITHER  THATS PATHETIC WE CAN COVER TRUMP AND OTHER THINGS AS WELL  AND THE BEST EVIDENCE IS  METOO  THE  METOO CASCADE DREW ON ANGER AT HOW TRUMP PREVAILED EVEN AFTER BOASTING ABOUT SEXUALLY ASSAULTING WOMEN  BUT IT SHINED THE SPOTLIGHT ELSEWHERE AND HAD ASTONISHING CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE STILL REVERBERATING AROUND THE WORLD IN SHORT  THINK OF THIS AS A MULTIFRONT WAR  TRUMP IS MOUNTING ONE ASSAULT ON OUR VALUES  INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES  AND WE HAVE TO FIGHT BACK  BUT IF WE BATTLE ONLY ON THAT FRONT  WE ARE IN EFFECT SURRENDERING EVERYWHERE ELSE

OURSELVES NOT ONLY WHAT COMPUTERS CAN DO BUT WHAT COMPUTERS SHOULD DO  HE SAID MICROSOFTS NEW ROLE IS PARTLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE COMPANY ISNT A MAJOR PLAYER IN SOCIAL MEDIA  VIDEO STREAMING AND SMARTPHONES  THE PRODUCTS BEHIND THE CURRENT DARK MOOD AROUND TECH  IT NO LONGER SQUEEZES THE OXYGEN OUT OF MARKETS AS AMAZON CAN BUT WHILE THE COMPANYS POWER HAS DIMINISHED SINCE A COUPLE OF DECADES

APPLE AND AMAZON AND AHEAD OF GOOGLE PARENT COMPANY  ALPHABET  AND FACEBOOK THE IRONY FOR MICROSOFT IS THAT THEY LOST IN SEARCH  THEY LOST IN SOCIAL NETWORKS AND THEY LOST IN MOBILE  AND AS A CONSEQUENCE  THEY HAVE AVOIDED THE RECENT PUSHBACK FROM GOVERNMENTS AND MEDIA  SAID DAVID YOFFIE  A PROFESSOR AT THE HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL  THIS HAS GIVEN MICROSOFT THE FREEDOM TO TAKE THE HIGH ROAD AS THE ETHICAL LEADER IN TECHNOLOGY SINCE TAKING THE REINS AT MICROSOFT IN 2014  MR  NADELLA HAS BROUGHT A MORE SENSITIVE STYLE OF LEADERSHIP TO THE COMPANY THAN HIS TWO PREDECESSORS  STEVE BALLMER

THE CASE AFTER CONGRESS ENACTED A LAW THAT MOOTED IT NOT ONLY DID MICROSOFT LEARN FROM ITS MISTAKES  SATYA IS A UNIQUE AND CARING INDIVIDUAL  SAID TIM OREILLY  A TECH INDUSTRY PUBLISHER AND CONFERENCE ORGANIZER  HE UNDERSTANDS DEEPLY THAT MICROSOFT MUST HELP OTHERS TO SUCCEED THE CLOSEST ANALOG AMONG MR  NADELLAS PEERS IS TIM D  COOK  THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF APPLE  WHO HAS PAINTED APPLE AS A STAUNCH DEFENDER OF ITS CUSTOMERS PRIVACY  HE HAS JABBED AT FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE  BOTH ADVERTISING SUPPORTED BUSINESSES THAT PROFIT FROM THE PERSONAL DATA THEY COLLECT FROM THEIR USERS  A CONTRAST TO APPLES BUSINESS MODEL OF SELLING DEVICES FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE  WHICH OWNS YOUTUBE  HAVE DEFENDED THEIR ADVERTISING BUSINESSES FOR ALLOWING THEM TO DELIVER SERVICES FOR FREE  THEYVE PROMISED TO ADD MORE HUMAN MODERATORS AND INVEST IN SOFTWARE TOOLS THAT CAN SCREEN OUT MISINFORMATION AND OTHER PROHIBITED CONTENT MR  COOK HAS NOT TURNED HIS IRE TOWARD MICROSOFT  WHICH GETS MOST OF ITS REVENUE FROM SOFTWARE  HARDWARE AND CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICES  THE COMPANY HAS INVESTMENTS IN INTERNET SERVICES THAT ARE SUPPORTED IN PART BY ADVERTISING  INCLUDING ITS BING SEARCH ENGINE AND LINKEDIN  THE SOCIAL NETWORK FOR PROFESSIONALS IT ACQUIRED IN 2016 MR  NADELLA HAS BEEN MORE HESITANT THAN MR  COOK TO PUBLICLY CRITICIZE OTHER TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES  TURNING TO MORE SUBTLE TYPES OF PERSUASION  A LOW KEY LEADER  MR  NADELLA PEPPERS HIS SPEECHES AND INTERVIEWS WITH REFERENCES TO LITERATURE  WARNING THAT CARELESS CREATORS OF TECHNOLOGY COULD CONTRIBUTE TO A DYSTOPIAN WORLD OF GEORGE ORWELLS 1984 OR ALDOUS HUXLEYS BRAVE NEW WORLD  HIS LIEUTENANT  MR  SMITH  HAS BECOME A UBIQUITOUS AMBASSADOR FOR MICROSOFT ON THE BIG SOCIAL ISSUES FACING TECHNOLOGY IN WASHINGTON  IN BRUSSELS AND ON THE CONFERENCE CIRCUIT

YOUR TV  YOU HELPED CREATE THIS MONSTER  AND NOW YOURE PROFITING OFF OF HIM  IF YOURE GOING TO PROFIT OFF OF TRUMP  YOU SHOULD AT LEAST GIVE HIM SOME MONEY  BECAUSE HE DOESNT HAVE ANY YOU KNOW DONALD

THE IRAN BACKED LEBANESE HEZBOLLAH MILITIA EMBROILED IN THAT WAR AND WATCHED SAUDI ARABIA TRY TO OUST ITS PRIME MINISTER YET CAMPAIGNING FOR SUNDAY S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION  THE FIRST IN NINE YEARS  HAS TIMIDLY SIDESTEPPED THE BIG ISSUES  LEAVING MANY LEBANESE EXPECTING MORE OF THE SAME  IT S ESPECIALLY GALLING FOR LEBANESE CONCERNED THAT A STILL DOMINANT HEZBOLLAH COULD DRAG THE COUNTRY INTO A LOOMING IRAN ISRAEL REGIONAL CONFRONTATION THE VOTE IS EXPECTED TO BE A TEST FOR THE COUNTRY S WESTERN BACKED SUNNI PRIME MINISTER  SAAD HARIRI  AND HIS IRAN BACKED SHIITE MILITANT OPPONENT  HEZBOLLAH  WHICH IS LOOKING TO TIGHTEN ITS GRIP AND EXPAND ITS PRESENCE IN THE 128 SEAT PARLIAMENT  LIKELY AT HARIRI S EXPENSE INTERIOR MINISTER NOUHAD MASHNOUK  A MEMBER OF HARIRI S INNER CIRCLE  SAID THE ELECTION IS NOT  A SUNNI SHIITE CONFLICT BUT RATHER A CONFLICT BETWEEN A GROUP THAT BELIEVES IN A STATE AND A NATION  AND ANOTHER THAT HAS REGIONAL AND IRANIAN LEANINGS THE SIDES  HOWEVER  CAN HARDLY GOVERN EFFECTIVELY WITHOUT EACH OTHER AND ARE EXPECTED TO RECREATE THE UNITY GOVERNMENT THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS  WHICH INCORPORATES MEMBERS OF THE MILITANT GROUP MOST OF THE CAMPAIGNING BY MORE THAN 500 CANDIDATES HAS REVOLVED AROUND PLATFORMS OF STABILITY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH  WITH MANY OF LEBANON S CIVIL WAR ERA POLITICAL TITANS SET TO RETURN  INCLUDING LEBANON S AGING SHIITE PARLIAMENT SPEAKER  NABIH BERRI  A HEZBOLLAH ALLY WHO HAS HELD THE POST FOR MORE THAN 25 YEARS AND WHO IS VIRTUALLY UNCONTESTED  SOME WARLORDS ARE PASSING ON THEIR SEATS TO THEIR SONS  INCLUDING DRUZE LEADER WALID JUMBLATT DIVISIVE ISSUES SUCH AS HEZBOLLAH S WEAPONS AND THE CONTROVERSY OVER ITS PARTICIPATION IN REGIONAL CONFLICTS ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY ABSENT FROM THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGNS  INDICATING IMPLICIT ACCEPTANCE OF THE PARTY S DOMESTIC HEGEMONY  WROTE ANALYST JOSEPH BAHOUT IN AN ARTICLE FOR THE CARNEGIE MIDDLE EAST CENTER A NEW ELECTION LAW AGREED ON LAST YEAR HAS OPENED CRACKS THROUGH WHICH RIVALS WITHIN THE SHIITE COMMUNITY COULD POTENTIALLY CHALLENGE HEZBOLLAH  AND POLITICAL NEWCOMERS AND INDEPENDENTS COULD TRY TO BREAK THROUGH THE MONOPOLY LONG ENJOYED BY THE POLITICAL DYNASTIES IT ALSO PROMISES TO SHAKE THINGS UP BY REORGANIZING LEBANON S ELECTORAL MAP  CONSOLIDATING 23 DISTRICTS INTO 15  AND AWARDING SEATS BY SHARE OF THE VOTE RECEIVED  RATHER THAN WINNER TAKES ALL  THE LAW ALSO ALLOWS LEBANESE EXPATRIATES TO VOTE ABROAD FOR THE FIRST TIME  ADDING A NEW LEVEL OF UNPREDICTABILITY TO THE MIX THE LAST TIME ELECTIONS WERE HELD IN LEBANON WAS IN 2009  SINCE THEN  MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT HAVE EXTENDED THEIR TERMS TWICE  CITING SECURITY THREATS LINKED TO THE WAR IN NEIGHBORING SYRIA LEBANON IS TECHNICALLY A PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY BUT IS SHACKLED BY A DECADES OLD SECTARIAN BASED POWER SHARING SYSTEM  AND ITS POLITICS ARE DOMINATED BY FORMER WARLORDS THAT HAVE LONG EXPLOITED THE SYSTEM TO PERPETUATE CORRUPTION AND NEPOTISM  ALL SENIOR GOVERNMENT POSITIONS ARE ALLOCATED ACCORDING TO SECT  INCLUDING THE HEAD OF STATE  WHO SHOULD BE A CHRISTIAN  THE PRIME MINISTER  A SUNNI MUSLIM  AND THE PARLIAMENT SPEAKER  A SHIITE  PARLIAMENT IS DIVIDED EQUALLY BETWEEN CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS  WITH SEATS ALLOTTED ACCORDING TO RELIGIOUS SECT THE FORMULA  BASED ON OUTDATED DEMOGRAPHIC DATA THAT DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY 200 000 PALESTINIANS WHO ARE DENIED CITIZENSHIP AND A VOTE  ALLOWS PEOPLE TO VOTE ACCORDING TO THEIR RELIGIOUS AFFILIATIONS  NOT A POLITICAL PROGRAM A RECORD NUMBER OF FIRST TIME HOPEFULS ARE CAMPAIGNING FOR CHANGE  URGING VOTERS TO SHUN POLITICIANS WHO HAVE

OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR MISMANAGEMENT PLAGUING LEBANON IT REFLECTS A NEW MINDSET EMERGING AMONG SIGNIFICANT SECTORS OF THE LEBANESE ELECTORATE  POINTING IN THE DIRECTION OF MAKING A SMALL DENT IN THE RELIGIOUS SECT BASED POLITICAL SYSTEM  SAID RANDA SLIM  AN ANALYST WITH THE WASHINGTON BASED MIDDLE EAST INSTITUTE STILL  THE BIGGEST WINNERS APPEAR TO BE HEZBOLLAH AND ITS ALLIES  WHO LOOK SET TO SCOOP UP AT LEAST SOME OF THE SEATS LOST BY HARIRI S COALITION  LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE EXPECTED FRAGMENTATION OF THE SUNNI VOTE HARIRI NOW HAS THE LARGEST BLOCK IN PARLIAMENT  BUT IS LIKELY TO LOSE SEATS TO RIVAL POLITICIANS  SOME OF HARIRI S SUPPORTERS SHIFTED THEIR ALLEGIANCE AFTER THE BILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN  WHO ALSO HOLDS SAUDI CITIZENSHIP  LAID OFF SCORES OF EMPLOYEES IN HIS DEVELOPMENT COMPANY  SAUDI OGER  AS WELL AS IN HARIRI OWNED CHARITIES AND MEDIA OUTLETS IN LEBANON  LARGELY BECAUSE OF SAUDI SPENDING CUTS THAT LOSS OF SUPPORT HAS BEEN COMPOUNDED BY WHAT SOME SEE AS A WEAK STANCE VIS A VIS HEZBOLLAH  ACCUSING HIM OF CATERING TO AND GIVING POLITICAL COVER TO THE MILITANT GROUP  WHICH A U N BACKED TRIBUNAL HAS ACCUSED IN THE 2015 ASSASSINATION OF HIS FATHER  RAFIK HARIRI HEZBOLLAH OFFERED ITS SUPPORT TO HARIRI AFTER HE WAS DETAINED IN SAUDI ARABIA LATE LAST YEAR DURING A VISIT TO RIYADH IN WHICH HE ANNOUNCED HIS RESIGNATION AS PRIME MINISTER  CITING IRAN AND HEZBOLLAH S MEDDLING IN THE REGION  THE MOVE WAS WIDELY SEEN AS SAUDI COERCION  ALTHOUGH HARIRI DENIES STEPPING DOWN AGAINST HIS WILL AND HAS SINCE REVERSED HIS RESIGNATION HEZBOLLAH NOW SEEKS  ALONG WITH ITS ALLIES  TO WIN AT LEAST 43 SEATS IN THE 128 MEMBER LEGISLATURE  WHICH WOULD ENABLE THE MILITANT GROUP TO VETO ANY LAWS IT OPPOSES HEZBOLLAH HAS SENT THOUSANDS OF FIGHTERS TO SYRIA TO SHORE UP PRESIDENT BASHAR ASSAD  AND HAS CLEARED THE VAST REGION ALONG THE COUNTRIES  SHARED BORDER OF ISLAMIC MILITANTS  LEAVING HUNDREDS OF ITS FIGHTERS KILLED AND WOUNDED  IT IS NOW CAMPAIGNING HEAVILY ON THOSE ACHIEVEMENTS ITS LEADER  SHEIKH HASSAN NASRALLAH  CALLED FOR HEAVY VOTER TURNOUT  PARTICULARLY IN THE BAALBEK HERMEL REGION IN EASTERN LEBANON  TRADITIONALLY A HEZBOLLAH STRONGHOLD WHICH NOW FACES A CHALLENGE FROM RIVALS YOU SHOULD PROTECT WITH YOUR VOTES YOUR VICTORIES AND ACHIEVEMENTS  FOR WHICH YOU VE PAID A VERY HIGH PRICE  NASRALLAH SAID IN AN APPEAL TO SUPPORTERS AT AN ELECTION RALLY IN THE AREA ON MONDAY DESPITE LIMITED PUSHBACK FROM THE SHIITE COMMUNITY  HEZBOLLAH HAS LARGELY DELIVERED ON ITS PROMISES IN SYRIA AS FAR AS THE SHIITE COMMUNITY IS CONCERNED AND WILL NOW BE EXPECTED TO DELIVER ON THE ECONOMIC FRONT  SLIM SAID SHE EXPECTS A GOVERNING COALITION BETWEEN HARIRI AND HEZBOLLAH TO RE EMERGE FROM SUNDAY S VOTE AND SAYS IF THE ELECTIONS PRODUCE A WEAKER HARIRI

20180502,politics,trump,1,JERUSALEM  AS ISRAEL FACES RISING TENSIONS WITH IRAN  SYRIA AND GAZA  ITS PARLIAMENT PASSED A NEW LAW ALLOWING THE PRIME MINISTER AND DEFENSE MINISTER TO DECIDE ALONE WHETHER THEIR NATION WILL GO TO WAR THE LEGISLATION  WHICH COMES AFTER MULTIPLE ATTACKS INSIDE SYRIA WIDELY BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BY ISRAEL  MAKES IT MUCH EASIER FOR PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU TO DECLARE WAR  ALTHOUGH THE NEW LAW RESTRICTS THE USE OF THAT POWER TO EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES  IT HAS PROVOKED DOMESTIC CRITICISM FOR CONCENTRATING IT IN THE HANDS OF JUST TWO PEOPLE THE LAW IS NOTHING LESS THAN INSANE  SAID OFER SHELAH  A LEGISLATOR FROM THE CENTRIST YESH ATID PARTY  WHICH SITS IN OPPOSITION  I AM DELUGED WITH CALLS FROM EXPERIENCED SECURITY OFFICIALS WHO ARE SHOCKED  AND RIGHTFULLY SO  HE WROTE ON TWITTER THE MEASURE  AN AMENDMENT TO THE BASIC LAWS THAT SERVE AS ISRAELS CONSTITUTION  PASSED ON MONDAY NIGHT BY A VOTE OF 62 TO 41 IN THE 120 SEAT KNESSET  THE VOTE WAS INITIALLY OVERSHADOWED BY MR  NETANYAHUS DRAMATIC  TELEVISED NEWS CONFERENCE THE SAME NIGHT IN WHICH HE PRESENTED EVIDENCE THAT HE SAID PROVED THAT IRAN HAD BEEN LYING ABOUT ITS EFFORTS TO BUILD A NUCLEAR WEAPON THE PRESENTATION  BASED ON A CACHE OF STOLEN IRANIAN DOCUMENTS  CAPPED A LONG CAMPAIGN BY MR  NETANYAHU TO KILL THE INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT TO CURB IRANS NUCLEAR PROGRAM  PRESIDENT TRUMP FACES A MAY 12 DEADLINE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO PULL THE UNITED STATES OUT OF THE AGREEMENT AND IT COMES AMID AN ESCALATING SHADOW WAR WITH IRAN AIRSTRIKES ON A SUSPECTED MISSILE STORAGE SITE NEAR HAMA  SYRIA  ON SUNDAY WHICH DESTROYED A CACHE OF MISSILES AND KILLED AT LEAST 16 PEOPLE  MANY OF THEM IRANIANS  WERE REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BY ISRAEL  ISRAEL IS BELIEVED TO HAVE CONDUCTED SEVERAL PREVIOUS ATTACKS IN SYRIA ON ASSETS BELONGING TO IRAN AND ITS ALLIES  AND IS BRACING FOR PROMISED IRANIAN RETALIATION FOR A STRIKE ON AN AIR BASE IN SYRIA LAST MONTH THE NEW LAW WOULD NOT NECESSARILY CHANGE THE PROCEDURE FOR THOSE AIRSTRIKES  WHICH ISRAEL HAS NOT ACKNOWLEDGED  WHAT APPROVAL MAY BE REQUIRED FOR THESE STRIKES IS NOT PUBLIC INFORMATION BUT IT COULD GIVE MR  NETANYAHU MORE LATITUDE TO BROADEN THE HOSTILITIES INTO OPEN WARFARE THE LAW WAS NOT WRITTEN WITH THE CURRENT SKIRMISHES WITH IRAN IN MIND  ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE ARCHITECTS OF THE REFORM  AND APPLIES TO ANY PRIME MINISTER AND DEFENSE MINISTER  NOT JUST THE CURRENT ONES STILL  CRITICS NOTE THAT MR  NETANYAHU IS UNDER INVESTIGATION IN MULTIPLE CORRUPTION CASES AND IS FIGHTING FOR HIS POLITICAL FUTURE  AND THE CURRENT DEFENSE MINISTER  AVIGDOR LIEBERMAN  IS A POLITICAL HARD LINER WITH LITTLE SECURITY EXPERIENCE  THOSE ISSUES COULD RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR MOTIVATIONS SHOULD THEY DECIDE TO TAKE ISRAEL TO WAR THE LAW REDUCES THE APPROVAL REQUIRED TO GO TO WAR FROM THE FULL CABINET TO HALF OF THE MUCH SMALLER SECURITY CABINET UNDER MOST CIRCUMSTANCES  BUT A PROVISION WAS ADDED LATE IN THE PROCESS TO GIVE THAT AUTHORITY TO THE PRIME MINISTER AND DEFENSE MINISTER IN EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES THE LAST MINUTE ADDITION GIVING AUTHORITY UNDER EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES TO THE PRIME MINISTER AND DEFENSE MINISTER ON THEIR OWN APPEARS TO BE OUT OF ORDER  SAID YEHUDA BEN MEIR  THE HEAD OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY AND PUBLIC OPINION PROJECT AT THE INSTITUTE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY STUDIES AT TEL AVIV UNIVERSITY  IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE TO ISRAELS CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT THE LAW DOES NOT DEFINE WHAT CONSTITUTES EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES PREVIOUSLY  ISRAELI LEADERS HAD TO SEEK THE APPROVAL OF THE FULL CABINET TO GO TO WAR  OR EVEN TO EMBARK ON A MILITARY ACTION THAT WAS LIKELY TO LEAD TO WAR  BUT IN RECENT YEARS  GOVERNMENTS HAVE SWELLED TO UP TO 30 MINISTERS  ADVOCATES OF THE NEW LAW SAY THAT WITH THE LARGER CABINETS  THAT SYSTEM HAS BECOME UNWIELDY HOWEVER  SOME EXPERTS ALSO SAID THAT THE LAW MAY HAVE LITTLE PRACTICAL EFFECT SINCE THE PRIME MINISTER AND DEFENSE MINISTER WERE UNLIKELY TO GO TO WAR WITHOUT STRONG POLITICAL BACKING AND THE SUPPORT OF THE MILITARY AND SECURITY AGENCIES  WHICH HAVE PROVEN IN THE PAST TO BE CAUTIOUS A GOVERNMENT CANNOT GO TO WAR  NO MATTER WHAT THE LAW SAYS  WITHOUT A NATIONAL CONSENSUS  SAID SHLOMO AVINERI  PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AT THE HEBREW UNIVERSITY OF JERUSALEM THAT MR  NETANYAHUS MOTIVES COULD COME UNDER SUSPICION BECAUSE OF HIS LEGAL TROUBLES ONLY STRENGTHENS THE NEED FOR PUBLIC AND POLITICAL SUPPORT  MR  AVINERI SAID OBVIOUSLY A PRIME MINISTER UNDER INVESTIGATION IS LIMITED BY THE KIND OF CHOICES HE CAN TAKE  AND THEY WILL BE SCRUTINIZED EVEN MORE THAN USUAL  MR  AVINERI SAID  ADDING THAT IN SUCH A CASE  THE NECESSITY FOR BROAD SUPPORT IS EVEN WIDER SEVERAL ANALYSTS POINTED TO AN EPISODE IN 2010 WHEN MR  NETANYAHU AND HIS DEFENSE MINISTER AT THE TIME  EHUD BARAK  WERE EAGER TO STRIKE IRANS NUCLEAR FACILITIES BUT WERE STOPPED FROM DOING SO BY THE ISRAELI MILITARY  WHICH SAID IT LACKED THE ABILITY  AND BY THE OPPOSITION OF THE BROADER SECURITY ESTABLISHMENT WHILE THAT EXAMPLE SUGGESTS THAT ISRAELI LEADERS WOULD NOT GO TO WAR WITHOUT BROADER SUPPORT  THE FOLLOWING YEAR  MR  NETANYAHU AND MR  BARAK WANTED TO STRIKE IRAN AGAIN BUT WERE STOPPED WHEN TWO MINISTERS BALKED AT THE IDEA  MR  BARAK LATER SAID UNDER THE NEW LAW  THEY MAY HAVE HAD A FREER HAND TO ATTACK IRAN A COMMITTEE WAS ESTABLISHED IN 2016 TO FORMULATE RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THE WORKINGS OF THE CABINET  HEADED BY YAAKOV AMIDROR  A FORMER ISRAELI NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER AND A MAJOR GENERAL IN THE RESERVES  THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED GIVING THE AUTHORITY TO GO TO WAR TO THE MORE SELECT SECURITY CABINET  WHICH BY LAW NUMBERS AT LEAST SEVEN MEMBERS AND NOT MORE THAN HALF THE MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT MR  AMIDROR SAID IN AN INTERVIEW

20180507,politics,trump,9,WASHINGTON ANKARA  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WILL ANNOUNCE ON TUESDAY WHETHER HE WILL WITHDRAW FROM THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL AND A SENIOR U S  OFFICIAL SAID IT WAS UNCLEAR IF EFFORTS BY EUROPEAN ALLIES TO ADDRESS TRUMP S CONCERNS WOULD BE ENOUGH TO SAVE THE PACT  TRUMP HAS REPEATEDLY THREATENED TO WITHDRAW FROM THE DEAL  WHICH EASED ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ON IRAN IN EXCHANGE FOR TEHRAN LIMITING ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM  UNLESS FRANCE  GERMANY AND BRITAIN   WHICH ALSO SIGNED THE AGREEMENT   FIX WHAT HE HAS CALLED ITS FLAWS  THE SENIOR U S  OFFICIAL SAID THE EUROPEAN ALLIES HAD MOVED SIGNIFICANTLY IN TRUMP S DIRECTION ON WHAT HE SEES AS THE DEFECTS   THE FAILURE TO ADDRESS IRAN S BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAM  THE TERMS UNDER WHICH INTERNATIONAL INSPECTORS VISIT SUSPECTED IRANIAN SITES  AND  SUNSET  CLAUSES UNDER WHICH SOME TERMS EXPIRE  THE OFFICIAL DID NOT KNOW  HOWEVER  IF THE EUROPEANS HAD DONE ENOUGH TO CONVINCE TRUMP TO REMAIN IN THE DEAL THE BIG QUESTION IN MY MIND IS DOES HE THINK THE EUROPEANS HAVE MOVED FAR ENOUGH SO THAT WE CAN ALL BE UNIFIED AND ANNOUNCE A DEAL  THATS ONE OPTION  SAID THE OFFICIAL   OR  DOES HE CONCLUDE  THE EUROPEANS HAVE NOT MOVED FAR ENOUGH AND WE SAY THEYVE GOT TO MOVE MORE EUROPEAN DIPLOMATS SAID PRIVATELY THEY EXPECTED TRUMP TO EFFECTIVELY WITHDRAW FROM THE AGREEMENT  WHICH WAS STRUCK BY SIX MAJOR POWERS   BRITAIN  CHINA  FRANCE  GERMANY  RUSSIA AND THE UNITED STATES   AND IRAN IN JULY 2015   ITS PRETTY OBVIOUS TO ME THAT UNLESS SOMETHING CHANGES IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS  I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT WILL NOT WAIVE THE SANCTIONS  ONE EUROPEAN DIPLOMAT SAID  ADDING HE SAW ONLY A  VERY SMALL  CHANCE THAT TRUMP STAYS IN THE DEAL EUROPEAN LEADERS HAVE WARNED THAT TRUMP S WITHDRAWAL WOULD STRIKE A BLOW TO THE ALLIANCE BETWEEN WESTERN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES  AND UNDO YEARS OF NEGOTIATIONS THAT THEY SAY WERE SUCCESSFUL IN HALTING IRAN S NUCLEAR AMBITIONS IRAN HAS RULED OUT RENEGOTIATING THE ACCORD AND THREATENED TO RETALIATE  ALTHOUGH IT HAS NOT SAID EXACTLY HOW  IF WASHINGTON PULLS OUT TRUMP GAVE NO INDICATION OF WHICH WAY HE WAS LEANING ON MONDAY  SAYING ONLY IN A TWITTER POST THAT HE WOULD ANNOUNCE HIS DECISION AT 2 P M   1800 GMT  ON TUESDAY IRAN BACKLASH UNDER THE DEAL  FORMALLY KNOWN AS THE JOINT COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF ACTION  JCPOA  THE UNITED STATES COMMITTED TO EASING A SERIES OF U S  SANCTIONS ON IRAN AND IT HAS DONE SO UNDER A STRING OF  WAIVERS  THAT EFFECTIVELY SUSPEND THEM UNDER U S  LAW  TRUMP HAS UNTIL SATURDAY TO DECIDE WHETHER TO REINTRODUCE U S  SANCTIONS RELATED TO IRAN S CENTRAL BANK AND IRANIAN OIL EXPORTS THE REIMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS WOULD DISSUADE FOREIGN COMPANIES FROM DOING BUSINESS WITH IRAN BECAUSE THEY COULD BE SUBJECT TO U S  PENALTIES BRINGING BACK U S  SANCTIONS COULD ALSO TRIGGER A BACKLASH BY IRAN  WHICH COULD RESUME ITS NUCLEAR ARMS PROGRAM OR PUNISH U S  ALLIES IN SYRIA  IRAQ  YEMEN AND LEBANON  DIPLOMATS SAID ON MONDAY  IRANIAN PRESIDENT HASSAN ROUHANI SUGGESTED IRAN COULD REMAIN IN THE ACCORD EVEN IF THE UNITED STATES DROPPED OUT BUT THAT TEHRAN WOULD FIERCELY RESIST U S  PRESSURE TO LIMIT ITS INFLUENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST ROUHANI SAID THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC HAD BEEN PREPARING FOR EVERY POSSIBLE SCENARIO  INCLUDING A DEAL WITHOUT WASHINGTON   WHICH WOULD STILL INCLUDE THE OTHER SIGNATORIES THAT REMAIN COMMITTED TO IT   OR NO DEAL AT ALL WE ARE PREPARED FOR ALL SCENARIOS AND NO CHANGE WILL OCCUR IN OUR LIVES NEXT WEEK  ROUHANI SAID IN A SPEECH BROADCAST LIVE ON STATE TV IF WE CAN GET WHAT WE WANT FROM A DEAL WITHOUT AMERICA  THEN IRAN WILL CONTINUE TO REMAIN COMMITTED TO THE DEAL  WHAT IRAN WANTS IS OUR INTERESTS TO BE GUARANTEED BY ITS NON AMERICAN SIGNATORIES    IN THAT CASE  GETTING RID OF AMERICA S MISCHIEVOUS PRESENCE WILL BE FINE FOR IRAN  TRUMP S IRAN TWEET HELPED OIL PRICES BREAK  A BARREL TO REACH THEIR HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE LATE 2014  ALLIES COMMITTED TO DEAL BRITAIN  FRANCE AND GERMANY REMAIN COMMITTED TO THE ACCORD AND  IN AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS U S  COMPLAINTS  WANT TO OPEN TALKS ON IRAN S BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAM  ITS NUCLEAR ACTIVITIES BEYOND 2025   WHEN PIVOTAL PROVISIONS OF THE DEAL EXPIRE   AND ITS ROLE IN THE WARS IN SYRIA AND YEMEN BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY BORIS JOHNSON  IN WASHINGTON THIS WEEK  SAID THE DEAL S WEAKNESSES COULD BE REMEDIED AT THIS MOMENT BRITAIN IS WORKING ALONGSIDE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND OUR FRENCH AND GERMAN ALLIES TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE  HE SAID IN A COMMENTARY IN THE NEW YORK TIMES  JOHNSON MET U S  SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO AND VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE ON MONDAY   DIPLOMATS SAY IRAN WOULD RATHER THE DEAL REMAIN INTACT OUT OF CONCERN ABOUT A REVIVAL OF DOMESTIC UNREST OVER ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS THAT MOUNTED OVER THE YEARS SANCTIONS WERE IN PLACE SANCTIONS IMPOSED ON IRAN IN EARLY 2012 BY THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPEAN UNION OVER ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM CUT IRAN S CRUDE EXPORTS FROM A PEAK OF 2 5 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY BEFORE THE SANCTIONS

OFFICE  TWO MEDICAL BILLING COMPANIES  TWO MANAGEMENT COMPANIES AND A TRANSPORTATION COMPANY THE VENTURES WERE NOTEWORTHY  IN PART  BECAUSE THEY WERE CREATED AT A TIME WHEN COUNTLESS PHONY COMPANIES WERE CROPPING UP TO EXPLOIT SO CALLED NO FAULT AUTO INSURANCE LAWS IN NEW YORK AND OTHER STATES  HUNDREDS OF DOCTORS  BUSINESSES OWNERS AND OTHERS WOULD EVENTUALLY BE CRIMINALLY CHARGED OR ACCUSED OF FRAUD BY INSURANCE COMPANIES THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT MR  COHEN OR THE COMPANIES HE CREATED WERE PART OF SUCH SCHEMES  NOR IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT MR  COHEN DID ANYTHING OTHER THAN REGISTER THE COMPANIES WITH STATE AUTHORITIES THE NO FAULT INSURANCE SCHEMES  WHICH WERE OFTEN MASTERMINDED BY ORGANIZED CRIME FIGURES FROM THE FORMER SOVIET UNION  ALL FOLLOWED A BASIC TEMPLATE  STAGED OR

COMPANIES HE HELPED SET UP WAS UNCLEAR  THE ONLY PEOPLE LISTED IN THE INCORPORATION PAPERS AS HAVING ROLES IN THE BUSINESSES ARE THE TWO DOCTORS  ALEKSANDR MARTIROSOV AND ZHANNA KANEVSKY  WHO WERE

20180502,politics,politics,9,WASHINGTON  PRESIDENT TRUMP PLUNGED INTO AN ANGRY DISPUTE ON WEDNESDAY BETWEEN CONSERVATIVE HOUSE REPUBLICANS AND THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL  SIDING WITH HARD LINE LAWMAKERS OVER HIS OWN JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AS THEY PRESSED FOR ACCESS TO SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE SPECIAL COUNSELS INVESTIGATION AND OTHER POLITICALLY CHARGED CASES IN A TWITTER POST  MR  TRUMP CALLED THE LEGAL SYSTEM RIGGED AND AMPLIFIED THE LAWMAKERS COMPLAINTS THAT THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL  ROD J  ROSENSTEIN  WAS NOT MOVING FAST ENOUGH TO TURN OVER THE DOCUMENTS THEY WANT  THE PRESIDENT STEPPED IN JUST AS MR  ROSENSTEIN APPEARED TO MOLLIFY THREE KEY COMMITTEE CHAIRMEN WHO WERE ALSO DEMANDING INTERNAL DOCUMENTS THEY DONT WANT TO TURN OVER DOCUMENTS TO CONGRESS  WHAT ARE THEY AFRAID OF  WHY SO MUCH REDACTING  WHY SUCH UNEQUAL JUSTICE  MR  TRUMP WROTE  AT SOME POINT I WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO USE THE POWERS GRANTED TO THE PRESIDENCY AND GET INVOLVED  WHICH PRESIDENTIAL POWERS MR  TRUMP WAS REFERRING TO WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY CLEAR DISTRUST BETWEEN MR  ROSENSTEIN AND CONGRESS HAS BEEN BUILDING OVER MONTHS  IN RECENT WEEKS  HE HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT GESTURES TO RELEASE DOCUMENTS DEMANDED BY PROMINENT CONGRESSMEN  ONLY TO BE THREATENED WITH IMPEACHMENT BY LAWMAKERS FROM THE FAR RIGHT MR  ROSENSTEIN RESPONDED ON TUESDAY TO THAT THREAT BY DECLARING THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WOULD NOT BE EXTORTED OFFICIALS AT THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVE THAT THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE NOW GONE TOO FAR WITH DOCUMENT REQUESTS RELATED TO CONTINUING INVESTIGATIONS THAT THE LAWMAKERS CLEARLY DO NOT SUPPORT  INCLUDING THE INQUIRY LED BY THE SPECIAL COUNSEL  ROBERT S  MUELLER III  INTO RUSSIAS ELECTION INTERFERENCE  A FORMER FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL FAMILIAR WITH THE DEPARTMENTS VIEWS SAID THAT MR  ROSENSTEIN AND TOP F B I  OFFICIALS HAVE COME TO SUSPECT THAT SOME LAWMAKERS WERE USING THEIR OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY TO GAIN INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THAT INVESTIGATION SO THAT IT COULD BE SHARED WITH THE WHITE HOUSE MR  TRUMPS THREAT ON WEDNESDAY TO INTERVENE BOLSTERED THOSE VOICES AND COULD UNDERMINE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS ABILITY TO PROTECT SOME OF ITS MOST CLOSELY HELD SECRETS  LAWMAKERS CONDUCTING OVERSIGHT ARE USUALLY GIVEN SUMMARIES OF THE INFORMATION  BUT NOT THE INTELLIGENCE COLLECTED DIRECTLY FROM WIRETAPS AND SENSITIVE SOURCES SIMILAR STANDOFFS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AND CONGRESS HAVE RESULTED IN COMPROMISE DATING BACK DECADES  BUT IN THOSE CASES  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAD THE SUPPORT OF THE PRESIDENT  WITHOUT MR  TRUMPS SUPPORT  CONGRESS IS GAINING THE ADVANTAGE REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS  FOR THEIR PART  ARGUE THAT MR  ROSENSTEINS DEPARTMENT HAS SLOW WALKED IMPORTANT REQUESTS AND WITHHELD CRUCIAL DETAILS FROM DOCUMENTS THEY DO TURN OVER  MATERIAL THEY SAY IS NECESSARY TO DOING THEIR JOBS  AND THEIR THREATS ARE HARDLY VEILED DESPITE HIS REPEATED PROMISES TO COOPERATE  MR  ROSENSTEINS SUPERVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS BEEN SORELY INADEQUATE  SAID REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS  REPUBLICAN OF NORTH CAROLINA AND ONE OF MR  ROSENSTEINS MOST OUTSPOKEN ANTAGONISTS  VALID INVESTIGATIVE REQUESTS FROM CONGRESS HAVE BEEN SLOW WALKED  STONEWALLED AND IMPEDED AT EACH STEP OF THE WAY UNDER HIS WATCH HE ADDED  IF MR  ROSENSTEINS HESITANCE TO PRODUCE DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION TO CONGRESS REPRESENTED AN EFFORT TO SAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FROM EMBARRASSMENT  IT IS TOO LATE MR  ROSENSTEIN  AWARE OF THE THREATS AGAINST HIM  HAS TAKEN UNUSUAL STEPS TO TRY TO MEET THE DEMANDS  ADDING EMPLOYEES TO REVIEW THE REQUESTED FILES AND SHARING UNREDACTED DOCUMENTS NORMALLY OFF LIMITS TO CONGRESS  INCLUDING MEMOS DRAFTED BY THE FORMER F B I  DIRECTOR JAMES B  COMEY ABOUT HIS INTERACTIONS WITH MR  TRUMP  THE DEPARTMENT HAS EVEN SET UP OFFICE SPACE AT ITS HEADQUARTERS FOR CONGRESSIONAL STAFF MEMBERS AND LAWMAKERS TO REVIEW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS ALREADY STUDIED BY THE DEPARTMENTS INSPECTOR GENERAL  ACCORDING TO A DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THOSE EFFORTS HAVE PLACATED POWERFUL REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE CHAIRMEN AFTER REPRESENTATIVE DEVIN NUNES OF CALIFORNIA  THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE  THREATENED LAST MONTH TO HOLD MR  ROSENSTEIN IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS OR PROCEED WITH IMPEACHMENT  MR  ROSENSTEIN GAVE HIM ACCESS TO AN ALMOST COMPLETELY UNREDACTED F B I  MEMO ON THE OPENING OF THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION AND WON HIS THANKS HE REACHED AN AGREEMENT LAST WEEK WITH THE TWO REPUBLICANS WHO RUN THE COMMITTEES THAT CONDUCT OVERSIGHT OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  REPRESENTATIVES ROBERT W  GOODLATTE OF VIRGINIA AND TREY GOWDY OF SOUTH CAROLINA  TO SATISFY THE LAST OF THEIR DEMANDS FOR DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE INVESTIGATION INTO HILLARY CLINTONS EMAILS AND OTHER DECISIONS RELATED TO THE RUSSIA CASE BUT THOSE COMPROMISES MAY HAVE ONLY EMBOLDENED MR  TRUMPS FIERCEST ALLIES  INCLUDING MR  MEADOWS  THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HARD LINE HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS  AND REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN OF OHIO  A FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE CAUCUS  IN AN UNUSUAL SHOW OF DEFIANCE  BOTH MEN HAVE INSISTED THAT THE AGREEMENT WITH THE CHAIRMEN OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY AND HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH AND THAT THEY NEED ACCESS TO AN UNREDACTED VERSION OF AN AUGUST 2017 MEMO OUTLINING THE SCOPE OF MR  MUELLERS INVESTIGATION DEMOCRATS FEAR THAT THE REPUBLICAN REQUESTS  MANY OF WHICH CALL ON THE DEPARTMENT TO IGNORE LONGSTANDING POLICY ABOUT WHAT IT SHARES WITH CONGRESS  ARE MEANT AS A TRAP  EITHER MR  ROSENSTEIN CAN TURN OVER INFORMATION THAT COULD BE USED TO UNDERMINE THE SPECIAL COUNSELS INQUIRY  OR HE COULD REFUSE  GIVING MR  TRUMP COVER  OR EVEN CAUSE  TO FIRE THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL REPRESENTATIVE JERROLD NADLER OF NEW YORK  THE TOP DEMOCRAT ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE  SAID THE LATEST REPUBLICAN EFFORTS WERE CLEARLY TRYING TO SABOTAGE MR  MUELLERS INVESTIGATION AND COURT A CONFRONTATION WITH MR  ROSENSTEIN ALL OF THIS NOISE IS AIMED AT UNDERMINING THE SPECIAL COUNSELS WORK AS THE INVESTIGATION CLOSES IN ON THE PRESIDENT  MR  NADLER SAID IN A STATEMENT  THE PRESIDENTS ATTACKS ON THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE GROW MORE PARANOID BY THE DAY  THE CASE FOR OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE  AND THE COMPLICITY OF THESE HOUSE REPUBLICANS  GROWS DAY BY DAY AS WELL MR  ROSENSTEIN  WHO HAS ALREADY GIVEN THE REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS ACCESS TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS  HAS MADE CLEAR IN RECENT DAYS THAT HE DOES NOT INTEND TO GO FURTHER ON MONDAY  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WROTE TO MR  MEADOWS AND MR  JORDAN TO DENY THEM ACCESS TO THE DOCUMENT ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THE RUSSIA INQUIRY  CITING DEPARTMENT POLICY AGAINST SHARING INFORMATION ON A CONTINUING INVESTIGATION THE DEPARTMENT RECOGNIZES THE KEEN INTEREST THAT CONGRESS HAS IN THE SPECIAL COUNSELS INVESTIGATION  BUT  RESPECTFULLY  WE MUST ADHERE TO THE LONGSTANDING POSITION OF THE DEPARTMENT THAT CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRIES PERTAINING TO ONGOING CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS THREATEN THE INTEGRITY OF THOSE INVESTIGATIONS  STEPHEN E  BOYD  AN ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL  WROTE IN THE LETTER  A COPY OF WHICH WAS PROVIDED TO THE NEW YORK TIMES WE HOPE YOU CAN RESPECT OUR POSITION  HE ADDED AND ON TUESDAY  MR  ROSENSTEIN  REACTING TO REPORTS THAT MR  MEADOWS HAD DRAFTED ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT TO USE AGAINST HIM IF NEEDED  PUSHED BACK HARD IF WE WERE TO JUST OPEN OUR DOORS TO ALLOW CONGRESS TO COME AND RUMMAGE THROUGH THE FILES  THAT WOULD BE A SERIOUS INFRINGEMENT ON THE SEPARATION OF POWERS  MR  ROSENSTEIN SAID AT AN EVENT IN WASHINGTON  IT MIGHT RESOLVE A DISPUTE TODAY  BUT IT WOULD HAVE NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS IN THE LONG RUN  AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DEFEND THE INSTITUTION IT IS UNUSUAL FOR RANK AND FILE MEMBERS OF A COMMITTEE TO CHALLENGE OR MANEUVER AROUND THEIR OWN CHAIRMEN ON SENSITIVE MATTERS

REPEATEDLY ATTACKED MR  SESSIONS FOR HIS RECUSAL THE PRESIDENTS WARNING ON WEDNESDAY WAS A SHARP DEPARTURE FROM EARLIER COMMENTS  WHEN HE HAS SAID THAT ALTHOUGH HE IS FRUSTRATED WITH THE INVESTIGATION INTO HIS CAMPAIGN  HE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE INVOLVED WITH DEPARTMENT MATTERS I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO BE INVOLVED WITH THE F B I  MR  TRUMP SAID IN AN INTERVIEW IN NOVEMBER  IM NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THE KIND OF THINGS THAT I WOULD LOVE TO BE DOING  AND IM VERY FRUSTRATED BY IT BUT MR  TRUMP IS INCREASINGLY ON THE DEFENSIVE  AFTER AN F B I  RAID OF THE OFFICE AND HOTEL ROOM OF HIS PERSONAL LAWYER  MICHAEL D  COHEN  AND THE DISCLOSURE OF MORE THAN 40 QUESTIONS THAT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL WOULD LIKE HIM TO ANSWER  THE QUESTIONS TOUCH ON A VARIETY OF TOPICS  INCLUDING COORDINATION WITH THE RUSSIANS

20180505,business,business,2,NEW ORLEANS  GLANCING AT THE STREET SIGNS ON A STROLL THROUGH UPTOWN AND DOWNTOWN NEW ORLEANS CAN SERVE AS A KIND OF SHUFFLED UP HISTORY LESSON  THE REFERENCES TO FRENCH ROYALTY  TO PROMINENT SPANIARDS  CREOLES AND AFRICAN AMERICANS  AND TO WORDS DERIVED FROM AMERICAN INDIAN TRIBES BETRAY A COMPLEX PAST  ONE INDELIBLY LINKED TO THE ARRAY OF CULTURES THAT HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY TO THE CENTER OF A CITY APPROACHING ITS TRICENTENNIAL BUT A HANDFUL OF SIGNS  SAIGON DRIVE  MY VIET DRIVE  TU DO DRIVE  IN VILLAGE DE LEST  A NEIGHBORHOOD AT THE CITYS EASTERN EDGE  SOME 15 MILES FROM THE FRENCH QUARTER  HINT AT AN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY THAT  IN MANY RESPECTS  HAS EXISTED ONLY ON THE MARGINS FOR DECADES  VILLAGE DE LEST HAS BEEN HOME TO SEVERAL THOUSAND VIETNAMESE AMERICANS  NOT THE LARGEST SUCH COMMUNITY IN THE COUNTRY  THOSE ARE FOUND IN CALIFORNIA AND TEXAS  BUT ONE OF THE MOST CONCENTRATED  YET  EVEN HERE IN NEW ORLEANS  SAID CYNDI NGUYEN  SEATED ON HER FRONT STOOP  A LOT OF PEOPLE DONT KNOW MUCH ABOUT OUR CULTURE LIKE MANY OF HER FELLOW RESIDENTS  MS  NGUYEN  WHO IS 48  SETTLED HERE WITH HER PARENTS AS PART OF A WAVE OF REFUGEES WHO ESCAPED FROM VIETNAM BEGINNING IN 1975  AFTER THE FALL OF SAIGON   MANY OF THE INITIAL REFUGEES WERE TIED TO THE UNITED STATES PRESENCE IN VIETNAM  EITHER AS SOLDIERS OR CIVIL SERVANTS  OTHERS FEARED RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION A LARGE PORTION OF THE POPULATION HERE  INCLUDING MS  NGUYENS FATHER  68  ONCE A FISHERMAN  AND HER MOTHER  65  WHO PEELED SHRIMP AT A SEAFOOD COMPANY  WAS DRAWN TO NEW ORLEANS BY THE PROMISE OF THE SOUTHERN LOUISIANA FISHING INDUSTRY  AND WITH SPONSORSHIP FROM THE LOCAL ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH  AND FOR THE FIRST 30 YEARS  MS  NGUYEN SAID  THE CLOSE KNIT  COMMUNITY EXISTED IN SOMETHING OF A COCOON  KEPT AT ARMS LENGTH FROM THE REST OF THE CITY BY LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL BARRIERS AND BY ITS ISOLATED LOCATION ALL OF THAT CHANGED IN 2005  THE DEVASTATION WROUGHT BY HURRICANE KATRINA  ALONG WITH A SERIES OF STRUGGLES IN THE HURRICANES AFTERMATH  FORCED THE VIETNAMESE COMMUNITY TO ASSERT ITSELF POLITICALLY  STARTING WITH SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGNS TO RESTORE CITY SERVICES TO VILLAGE DE LEST AND  MORE PROMINENTLY  TO OPPOSE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEARBY LANDFILL  LESS THAN FIVE YEARS LATER  THE DEEPWATER HORIZON OIL SPILL  WHICH AFFECTED THE COMMUNITY DISPROPORTIONATELY  GIVEN ITS TIES TO THE SEAFOOD INDUSTRY  PRECIPITATED ANOTHER ROUND OF COMMUNITY ACTIVISM AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT THAT WAS CENTERED ON THE CREATION OF ALTERNATIVE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AND THE PURSUIT OF COMPENSATION FOR WIDESPREAD LOSS OF INCOME THEN  MORE RECENTLY  CAME ANOTHER SEMINAL EVENT  MS  NGUYEN WON A SEAT ON THE NEW ORLEANS CITY COUNCIL IN LAST YEARS MUNICIPAL ELECTION  WHEN SHE TAKES OFFICE ON MONDAY  SHE WILL BE THE CITYS FIRST ASIAN AMERICAN COUNCIL MEMBER NOW  43 YEARS AFTER THE FALL OF SAIGON AND ALMOST 13 YEARS AFTER KATRINA  THE VIETNAMESE ENCLAVE WITHIN VILLAGE DE LEST IS CHANGING  IN SOME WAYS DRASTICALLY  AND MANY RESIDENTS THINK THE COMMUNITY IS NEARING ANOTHER INFLECTION POINT  SOME OF THE STRONGEST TIES THAT ONCE BOUND PEOPLE TOGETHER HERE  PARTICULARLY THE RELIANCE ON A SHARED LANGUAGE AND RELIGION  ARE BEGINNING TO FRAY WITHIN THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS  MANY OF WHOM ARE NO LONGER FLUENT IN VIETNAMESE AND  FOLLOWING A GENERAL TREND  ARE LESS INVESTED IN THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH  GREATER ACCESS TO EDUCATION  AND THE SUBSEQUENT JOB PROSPECTS THAT SUCH ACCESS PROVIDES  ARE ALSO DRIVING YOUNGER VIETNAMESE AMERICANS INCREASINGLY FARTHER FROM NEW ORLEANS EAST  ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF A DEARTH OF LOCAL ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY COLLECTIVELY  THESE CHANGES RAISE BROAD QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LIFE SPAN OF CONCENTRATED IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE UNITED STATES  AND ABOUT THE SEEMINGLY OPPOSING AIMS OF MAINTAINING RICH CULTURAL PRACTICES  OFTEN KINDLED BY FORMS OF ISOLATION  AND PROVIDING FOR GREATER DEGREES OF ENGAGEMENT AND INTEGRATION  ITS SOMETHING WERE ALL THINKING ABOUT  SAID LANG LE  WHO IS 49 AND SETTLED HERE WITH HER FAMILY AS A VIETNAMESE REFUGEE IN 1975  MY GENERATION  WERE MOSTLY STILL HERE  BUT THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS ARE MOVING OUT  THEYRE GOING TO COLLEGE  GETTING THEIR DEGREES  HEADING FOR TEXAS AND CALIFORNIA AND THOSE CONCERNS ARE INFLUENCING THE COMMUNITYS LONG TERM OUTLOOK  ALONG WITH ITS PLANS FOR THE FUTURE  BOTH LARGE AND SMALL  WERE TALKING ABOUT INVESTING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN A NEW CHURCH  MS  LE SAID  BUT DO WE NEED TO BUILD A CHURCH IF 10  20 YEARS FROM NOW  THE KIDS WONT BE HERE TO ATTEND IT  TO BE SURE  VILLAGE DE LEST IS STILL HOME TO A VIBRANT ARRAY OF VIETNAMESE TRADITIONS  MANY OF WHICH REVOLVE AROUND THREE CULTURAL PILLARS  RELIGION  FAMILY AND FOOD ITS HARD TO OVERSTATE THE CENTRALITY OF RELIGIOUS LIFE  AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE VIETNAMESE COMMUNITY HERE IS ROMAN CATHOLIC  AND THE LOCAL CHURCH  MARY QUEEN OF VIETNAM  SERVES THE RESIDENTS IN WAYS THAT EXTEND FAR BEYOND THE LITURGICAL ALL KINDS OF SOCIAL ISSUES COME TO THE CHURCH  AND TO THE PASTOR  SAID TONY TRAN  54  A LONGTIME PARISH COORDINATOR  POLITICAL  SOCIAL  MEDICAL ISSUES  THE WHOLE NINE YARDS  IN ITS EARLY DAYS  HE SAID  THE CHURCH EVEN HELPED TO EDUCATE RESIDENTS ABOUT  AND TRANSLATE  THE STATES ELECTRICAL CODES THE CHURCH HOSTS THE COMMUNITYS ANNUAL TET FESTIVAL  A CELEBRATION OF THE LUNAR NEW YEAR AN EVENT THAT INCLUDES FIREWORK DISPLAYS AND DRAGON DANCES  THE CHURCH WAS ALSO INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING TO BEGIN A COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION  MQVN  THAT SINCE 2006 HAS ADVOCATED A RANGE OF DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS  INCLUDING THOSE TIED TO HEALTH CARE  EDUCATION  HOUSING  SOCIAL SERVICES AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AMONG MQVNS SUCCESSFUL VENTURES WAS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A FARMING COOPERATIVE  VEGGI  WHICH HELPED PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED INCOME TO RESIDENTS WHOSE LIVELIHOODS WERE WIPED OUT BY THE DEEPWATER HORIZON SPILL IN 2010 AFTER THE SPILL  A LOT OF PEOPLE BASICALLY LOST THEIR JOBS OVERNIGHT  SAID KHAI NGUYEN  32  A PROGRAM OFFICER AT MQVN  WHO ESTIMATED THAT A THIRD OF THE COMMUNITY WORKED IN AFFECTED INDUSTRIES  PREDOMINANTLY FISHERMEN AND SHRIMPERS  HE SAID  BUT ALSO RESTAURANT OWNERS  SERVERS  SEAFOOD WHOLESALERS AND OYSTER SHUCKERS  THE ORGANIZATION RAISED MONEY TO HELP RESIDENTS BUILD GREENHOUSES AND AQUAPONIC SYSTEMS  IT ALSO ESTABLISHED A COMMUNITY FARM ON LAND ACROSS FROM THE CHURCH IF YOU DRIVE AROUND HERE  MOST PEOPLE ARE GROWING SOMETHING IN THEIR FRONT YARDS OR BACKYARD  KHAI NGUYEN SAID  SO WE RECOGNIZED THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ALREADY HAD THE COMMITMENT AND PASSION FOR FARMING  PERSONAL AND COMMUNITY GARDENS ASIDE  THE COMMUNITYS INTRINSIC CONNECTION TO AGRICULTURE IS NOWHERE MORE EVIDENT THAN AT ITS WEEKLY FARMERS MARKET  BEGINNING BEFORE DAWN ON SATURDAY MORNINGS  RESIDENTS GATHER IN A PARKING LOT TO SELL AND BARTER A RANGE OF PRODUCTS  FROM HERBS  SHISO  CILANTRO  AND VEGETABLES  KOHLRABI  WAX GOURD  GREEN ONIONS  EGGPLANT  TO FISH  SHRIMP AND POULTRY THE PRODUCE IS MOSTLY LAID OUT ON THE GROUND ON MATS OR PLASTIC SHEETS  VENDORS SELL HOMEMADE COOKED FOOD  TOO  STICKY RICE  BANH TET RICE CAKES  SEAFOOD DISHES  OUTSIDERS ARE WELCOME  OF COURSE  BUT SHOULDNT EXPECT ANY SPECIAL ACCOMMODATION  A VAST MAJORITY OF CONVERSATIONS TAKE PLACE IN VIETNAMESE  AND OFTEN BY NECESSITY THE FARMERS  THEY GROW EVERYTHING IN OUR OWN BACKYARD  SAID THONG PHAN  A FISHERMAN WHO  ON A RECENT SATURDAY MORNING  STOOD OVER A SELECTION OF DRIED SHRIMP  KING MACKEREL AND SOFT SHELL CRAB  PART OF THE SECRET TO THEIR SUCCESS  HE ADDED  LIES IN THE ORIGIN OF THE SEEDS  WHICH  OVER THE YEARS  MANY RESIDENTS BROUGHT FROM VIETNAM IN SPITE OF ITS ROBUST AGRICULTURAL LIFE  THE VIETNAMESE COMMUNITY IN VILLAGE DE LEST FACES CONSIDERABLE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES  THERES JUST NOT ENOUGH BUSINESS  SAID ANH HOANG  WHO RUNS A GROCERY STORE  MINH CANH  THAT SERVES THE LOCAL AREA  NOT LONG AGO  THIS WHOLE CORRIDOR WAS FULL OF VIETNAMESE OWNED BUSINESSES  AND IT WAS FULLY OCCUPIED  BUT NOW THE OCCUPANCY RATE IS WAY DOWN  HE SAID  GESTURING ACROSS THE STREET AT A STRING OF AGING AND SHUTTERED BUSINESSES  AND THE DECLINING ECONOMIC TRENDS  HE SAID  ARE AT LEAST PARTLY TIED TO THE COMMUNITYS CULTURAL SHIFTS AS A CULTURE  WE USED TO BE MORE FAMILY ORIENTED  SAID MR  HOANG  WHO OPENED HIS STORE IN 2005 WITH HIS PARENTS  REFUGEES WHO SETTLED IN VILLAGE DE LEST IN 1976 AND INITIALLY WORKED AS FOOD VENDORS  BACK THEN  THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE HERE STUCK TOGETHER  BUT ITS DIFFERENT NOW  WERE TRANSITIONING  EVERY GENERATION  IT MOVES TOWARD THAT AMERICAN WAY  ORIENTED TOWARD THE INDIVIDUAL AARON TRUONG  WHO OWNS A SHOPPING STRIP AND RUNS A DRY CLEANING BUSINESS IN VILLAGE DE LEST  ATTESTED TO SIMILAR DECLINES  AS YOU CAN SEE  ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF THE OFFICES HERE ARE EMPTY  HE SAID  NOBODY COMES AROUND ASKING TO RENT ANYMORE THERES BIGGER ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY ELSEWHERE  HE SAID  ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE SOME OF THE SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSES TO HAVE SPRUNG FROM VILLAGE DE LEST ARE THOSE THAT HAVE INTEGRATED MORE BROADLY INTO GREATER NEW ORLEANS  DONG PHUONG BAKERY  FOR EXAMPLE  WHICH SUPPLIES MANY RESTAURANTS IN THE CITY WITH BREAD FOR BANH MI SANDWICHES  HAS GAINED NATIONAL ATTENTION FOR ITS BAKED GOODS  MOST RECENTLY AS A WINNER OF A 2018 JAMES BEARD FOUNDATION AMERICAS CLASSICS AWARD MORE GENERALLY  THE PROLIFERATION OF PHO AND BANH MI RESTAURANTS THROUGHOUT THE CITY  SEVERAL RESIDENTS POINTED OUT  IS PROOF OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF VIETNAMESE CULTURE ARE BEING INTEGRATED AND ASSIMILATED INTO GREATER NEW ORLEANS   AS IS OFTEN CITED  LOUISIANA AND VIETNAM ARE BOTH ONETIME COLONIES OF FRANCE  AND FRENCH INFLUENCES ABOUND IN BOTH CULINARY CULTURES  THE PO BOY AND BANH MI  FOR EXAMPLE  SHARE A COMMON ANCESTOR IN THE BAGUETTE  LOCALLY  BANH MI IS SOMETIMES MARKETED AS THE VIETNAMESE PO BOY BUT EVEN IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY  THE ROLE OF FAMILY CAN BE A POWERFUL FORM OF INSPIRATION  AS IS EXEMPLIFIED BY NAMESE  A VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT IN THE MID CITY NEIGHBORHOOD  BUILT AT THE SAME LOCATION AS A CORNER CONVENIENCE STORE RUN BY SOI TRAN  WHO SETTLED IN VILLAGE DE LEST AS A REFUGEE IN 1975  NAMESE IS NOW OWNED AND RUN BY MS  TRANS CHILDREN  HIEU  LOI  VINH AND LONG DOAN WEVE INHERITED SO MANY OF OUR CULINARY TRADITIONS FROM OUR PARENTS  HIEU DOAN SAID  BUT OUR GENERATION  WERE A LITTLE MORE BUSINESS SAVVY  AND MORE WILLING TO INCORPORATE ELEMENTS OF NEW ORLEANS CULTURE AS WELL WE GREW UP MAKING  EATING AND SELLING GUMBOS AND PO BOYS  HE ADDED WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE VIETNAMESE COMMUNITY IN VILLAGE DE LEST  RESIDENTS OFFERED A RANGE OF RESPONSES SOME  LIKE AARON TRUONG  DOUBT THE COMMUNITY WILL LAST ANOTHER GENERATION  DOWN THE ROAD  20 YEARS FROM NOW  YOURE NOT GOING TO SEE A WHOLE LOT BACK HERE ANYMORE  HE SAID  THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO END UP SPREAD ELSEWHERE CYNDI NGUYEN  THE COUNCILWOMAN ELECT  ALSO THINKS THE COMMUNITY HERE MAY DIMINISH  THOUGH SHE INTERPRETS IT MORE POSITIVELY  WE MAY SPREAD OUT INTO OTHER PARTS OF NEW ORLEANS  SHE SAID  BUT IN A WAY I THINK THATS GOOD THING  THAT SHOULD BE A VICTORY FOR US WE DIDNT COME OVER HERE JUST TO STAY BY OURSELVES  SHE ADDED  NO MATTER WHERE I LIVE  AS A VIETNAMESE AMERICAN PERSON  IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP UP THE TRADITIONS AND THE CULTURE  I DONT HAVE TO LIVE NEXT DOOR TO A VIETNAMESE PERSON TO FEEL LIKE WE HAVE KEPT MY CULTURE INTACT SURPRISINGLY  SOME OF THE MOST OPTIMISTIC RESPONSES ABOUT THE COMMUNITYS CONTINUED SURVIVAL COME FROM THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS  TUAN NGUYEN  THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF MQVN  WHO IS 37 AND GREW UP IN VILLAGE DE LEST  ACKNOWLEDGED THAT  EVEN THOUGH MANY OF HIS PEERS HAD LEFT  THE COMMUNITY AND ITS CULTURE HAD A WAY OF DRAWING PEOPLE BACK WE MAY NOT BECOME FARMERS OR FISHERMEN  BUT WE DO ROTATE BACK TO THOSE FISHING GROUNDS AND GROWING GROUNDS  HE SAID  I FIND MYSELF WANTING TO BE OUT ON THE FARM  WANTING TO GO FISHING  NOT COMMERCIALLY  BUT TO BE OUT ON THE WATER AND THERE ARE FEW THINGS HIS DAUGHTER LOVES MORE  HE SAID  THAN SPENDING AN AFTERNOON WITH HER GRANDMOTHER AT VILLAGE DE LESTS COMMUNITY FARM SOMEHOW  HE SAID  IT ALL LOOPS BACK AROUND
20180503,business,market,4,OVER THE OPPOSITION OF LAWYERS FOR A COMPANY OWNED BY PRESIDENT DONALD J  TRUMP  STATE SUPREME COURT JUDGE EILEEN BRANSTEN RULED THURSDAY THAT A CONDOMINIUM ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE COULD REMOVE THE BRONZE LETTERS SPELLING OUT HIS NAME FROM ITS 46 STORY BUILDING THE RULING OPENS THE DOOR FOR THE 377 CONDO OWNERS AT 200 RIVERSIDE BOULEVARD TO FORMALLY VOTE ON WHETHER TO KEEP OR REMOVE THE T R U M P LETTERS THAT HAVE ADORNED THE BUILDING  BETWEEN 69TH AND 70TH STREETS  FOR THE PAST 19 YEARS READING A 12 PAGE DOCUMENT FROM THE BENCH  JUDGE BRANSTEN REPEATEDLY REJECTED  DISMISSED OR FOUND THE TRUMP LAWYERS ARGUMENTS TO BE UNPERSUASIVE AND GRANTED SUMMARY JUDGMENT TO THE CONDOMINIUMS BOARD THE RULING CAME IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST IN JANUARY BY THE BOARD  ASKING THE JUDGE TO DECLARE THAT A LICENSING AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE BUILDING AND DJT HOLDINGS  ONE OF MR  TRUMPS COMPANIES  THAT GAVE THE CONDO THE RIGHT TO USE THE TRUMP NAME ON ITS FACADE  DID NOT REQUIRE IT TO USE THE NAME AFTER MR  TRUMP WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT IN 2016  A STRAW POLL OF BUILDING RESIDENTS FOUND THAT TWO THIRDS OF THE 253 CONDO OWNERS WHO PARTICIPATED WANTED TO REMOVE THE NAME  WHILE 23 PERCENT WANTED TO KEEP IT  BUT A LAWYER FOR A TRUMP SUBSIDIARY SENT A LETTER PROMISING TO FILE SUIT IF THE BOARD TOOK ANY ACTION IN THE LETTER  MR  TRUMPS LAWYER  ALAN GARTEN  SAID THAT IF THE CONDO MADE ANY EFFORT TO REMOVE THE TRUMP LETTERING  MR  TRUMP WOULD COMMENCE APPROPRIATE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS TO NOT ONLY PREVENT SUCH UNAUTHORIZED ACTION  BUT TO ALSO RECOVER THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DAMAGES  COSTS AND ATTORNEYS FEES THAT WAS NO SMALL MATTER IN THE MINDS OF MANY CONDO OWNERS  MR  TRUMP HAS A REPUTATION AS A VIGOROUS IF NOT ALWAYS VICTORIOUS PLAINTIFF AND DEFENDANT WHOSE DETERMINATION TO DRAG OUT A COURT FIGHT COULD COST A FORTUNE MR  TRUMP  FOR INSTANCE  SPENT 15 YEARS FENDING OFF A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OVER THE USE OF 200 UNDOCUMENTED POLISH WORKERS AT HIS FIRST SIGNATURE LUXURY BUILDING  TRUMP TOWER  HE SETTLED THE MATTER IN 1998 IN A ONCE SECRET SETTLEMENT IN WHICH HIS OPPONENTS ESSENTIALLY GOT EVERYTHING THEY HAD ORIGINALLY ASKED FOR   375 MILLION MR  TRUMP  HOWEVER  DID NOT ADMIT ANY WRONGDOING AND THE BATTLE OVER THE T R U M P LETTERS AT 200 RIVERSIDE MAY NOT BE OVER  AMANDA MILLER  A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION  CALLED THE JUDGES DECISION BOTH UNPRECEDENTED AND LIMITED TO A TECHNICAL ISSUE IN A SIGN THAT THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION WILL CHALLENGE JUDGE BRANSTENS RULING  MS  MILLER SAID THE COMPANY WAS CONFIDENT THAT THE APPEALS COURT WILL CONCLUDE OTHERWISE MARTI FRUCCI  A RESIDENT OF 200 RIVERSIDE WHO RENTS HER APARTMENT FROM THE OWNER  SAID SHE IS FOLLOWING THE DEBATE CLOSELY BECAUSE SHE MAY BUY AN APARTMENT THERE IN THE FUTURE I DONT THINK IT ADDS ANYTHING TO THE BUILDING  SHE SAID OF THE TRUMP BRAND  THERE ARE A LOT OF US WHO CRINGE WHEN PEOPLE ASSOCIATE THE BUILDING WITH HIS NAME STILL  SOME RESIDENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT BEING ENSNARED IN COSTLY AND LENGTHY LITIGATION  I WOULD RATHER THE BUILDING SPEND MONEY ON A LONG GESTATING RENOVATION PROJECT THAN THIS LITIGATION  SAID THE LONGTIME RESIDENT WHO ASKED FOR ANONYMITY BECAUSE FEELINGS ARE RUNNING HOT IN THE BUILDING THE MARCH 2000 LICENSING AGREEMENT WAS MADE IN THE EARLY DAYS OF MR  TRUMPS EFFORT TO ESTABLISH THE TRUMP BRAND THE AGREEMENT IDENTIFIED MR  TRUMP IN THE FIRST SENTENCE AS A WORLDWIDE RENOWNED BUILDER AND DEVELOPER OF REAL ESTATE WHO ENJOYS THE HIGHEST REPUTATION IN THESE FIELDS AMONG OTHERS  AND IT GRANTED THE CONDOMINIUM OWNERS THE CONTINUED USE OF THE TRUMP NAME FOR   FOREVER THE TRUMP LAWYERS HAVE ARGUED IN COURT PAPERS THAT THE CONSIDERATION THAT FLOWED TO MR  TRUMP WAS NOT SIMPLY A SINGLE DOLLAR  BUT RATHER THE ASSURANCE THAT THE BUILDING WOULD BE NAMED TRUMP PLACE IN PERPETUITY JUDGE BRANSTEN  FOLLOWING IN THE PATH OF FEDERAL JUDGES WHO HAVE RECENTLY CONFOUNDED MR  TRUMP IN COURT ON IMMIGRATION ISSUES  FOUND THAT THE FOUR PAGE LICENSING AGREEMENT BETWEEN MR  TRUMP AND THE CONDOMINIUM GAVE THE CONDO PERMISSION TO USE THE TRUMP NAME BUT IN NO WAY REQUIRES THE OWNER TO USE IT  THEREFORE  NOTHING PREVENTS THE BOARD FROM TAKING IT OFF THE BUILDING THE BOARD PLANS TO CONDUCT A FORMAL VOTE OF OWNERS TO DECIDE THE MATTER  THE BOARD HAS ESTIMATED THAT IT WOULD COST ABOUT  000 TO REMOVE THE LETTERS AND ANOTHER  000 TO WASH THE FACADE OF THE BUILDING AFTERWARD THE ONCE UBIQUITOUS TRUMP BRAND HAS BECOME DIVISIVE SINCE MR  TRUMP ENTERED THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  AT THE SAME TIME  TRUMP BRANDED BUILDINGS IN NEW YORK HAVE LAGGED BEHIND THE LUXURY MARKET  SELLING FOR ABOUT 6 6 PERCENT LESS THAN THE AVERAGE MANHATTAN CONDOMINIUM IN 2017 CONDO OWNERS AT THE TRUMP PARC IN STAMFORD  CONN  ARE DEBATING A SIMILAR MOVE AS THE OWNERS OF 200 RIVERSIDE BOULEVARD  THE SILVER T R U M P LETTERS WERE PRIED OFF A TROUBLED HOTEL AND RESIDENTIAL CONDOMINIUM IN PANAMA CITY EARLIER THIS YEAR  THE TRUMP INTERNATIONAL HOTEL AND TOWER IN TORONTO WAS RENAMED THE ADELAIDE THE TRUMP NAME WAS CLIPPED OFF THE TRUMP SOHO  A CONDOMINIUM HOTEL IN MANHATTAN  AND THREE RENTAL APARTMENT BUILDINGS JUST SOUTH OF 200 RIVERSIDE EXCISED THE TRUMP NAME FROM THE BUILDING AND THE STAFFS UNIFORMS WITHOUT ANY REPERCUSSIONS AFTER MR  TRUMP WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT BUT THE TRUMP COMPANY HAD APPARENTLY HOPED TO STEM THE TIDE AT 200 RIVERSIDE OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM  LAWRENCE S  ROSEN  A LAWYER FOR MR  TRUMP SAID OF THE JUDGE  SHE GOT IT WRONG BUT WE RESPECT HER DECISION  HE INSISTED THAT REMOVAL OF THE SIGNAGE WOULD REQUIRE APPROVAL BY TWO THIRDS OF THE CONDO OWNERS  RATHER THAN A SIMPLE MAJORITY  AN ISSUE JUDGE BRANSTEN DID NOT ADDRESS FURTHER  MR  ROSEN SAID THAT RESIDENTS IN THE PAST HAD SEEN THE TRUMP BRAND AS VALUABLE  SOMETHING THEY WERE WILLING TO PAY FOR THE LICENSING DOCUMENT WAS SIGNED IN 2000 BY MR  TRUMP AND PAUL DAVIS  PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGERS AT 200 RIVERSIDE  BUT MR  DAVIS DID NOT OWN A CONDO IN THE BUILDING  HE WAS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF HUDSON WATERFRONT ASSOCIATES  A COMPANY CREATED BY THE HONG KONG BILLIONAIRES WHO OWNED THE LAND ON WHICH THE PROJECT WAS BEING BUILT AND OVERSAW THE DEVELOPMENT HARRY LIPMAN  A LAWYER FOR THE CONDO BOARD  SAID  WERE PLEASED  OBVIOUSLY  BUT DECLINED FURTHER COMMENT

WEEKS OF PREGNANCY  PROPELLING THE STATE OVERNIGHT TO THE FRONT OF A PUSH AMONG CONSERVATIVE STATEHOUSES JOCKEYING TO ENACT THE NATION S MOST RESTRICTIVE REGULATIONS ON THE PROCEDURE CRITICS SAY THE SO CALLED  HEARTBEAT  BILL  WHICH NOW AWAITS THE SIGNATURE OF ANTI ABORTION GOP GOV  KIM REYNOLDS  WOULD BAN ABORTIONS BEFORE SOME WOMEN EVEN KNOW THEY RE PREGNANT  THAT COULD SET UP THE STATE FOR A LEGAL CHALLENGE OVER ITS CONSTITUTIONALITY  INCLUDING FROM THE SAME FEDERAL APPEALS COURT THAT THREE YEARS AGO STRUCK DOWN SIMILAR LEGISLATION APPROVED IN ARKANSAS AND NORTH DAKOTA BACKERS OF THE LEGISLATION  WHICH FAILED TO GET A SINGLE DEMOCRATIC VOTE IN EITHER IOWA CHAMBER  EXPRESSED HOPE IT COULD CHALLENGE ROE VS  WADE  THE LANDMARK 1973 U S  SUPREME COURT RULING THAT ESTABLISHED WOMEN HAVE A RIGHT TO TERMINATE PREGNANCIES UNTIL A FETUS IS VIABLE  CONSERVATIVES SAY AN INFLUX OF RIGHT LEANING JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP COULD MAKE IT A POSSIBILITY TODAY WE WILL BEGIN THIS JOURNEY AS IOWA BECOMES GROUND ZERO  NOW NATIONALLY  IN THE LIFE MOVEMENT  SEN  RICK BERTRAND  A REPUBLICAN FROM SIOUX CITY  SAID DURING FLOOR DEBATE ERIN DAVISON RIPPEY  A SPOKESWOMAN FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF THE HEARTLAND  SAID IN A STATEMENT IOWA REPUBLICANS  DO NOT CARE HOW MUCH TAXPAYER MONEY WILL BE SPENT ON A LAWSUIT   OR HOW MANY FAMILIES MAY CHOOSE TO GO ELSEWHERE BECAUSE IOWA IS NO LONGER A STATE WHERE THEY ARE SAFE TO LIVE AND WORK THE HOUSE BEGAN DEBATE OVER THE MEASURE EARLY TUESDAY AFTERNOON  VOTING IT OUT SHORTLY BEFORE MIDNIGHT WITH SIX REPUBLICANS THERE OPPOSING IT  THE SENATE THEN PICKED IT UP  WITH APPROVAL SHORTLY AFTER 2 A M  WEDNESDAY  THE NEARLY BACK TO BACK VOTES COME AS IOWA LAWMAKERS ARE ON OVERTIME AT THE STATE CAPITOL  TRYING TO PASS A SPENDING BUDGET

GENERAL TOM MILLER TOLD REPORTERS WEDNESDAY HE S REVIEWING WHETHER HIS OFFICE WOULD DEFEND THE BILL IF SIGNED INTO LAW  ACKNOWLEDGING HIS STAFF IS REVIEWING ITS CONSTITUTIONALITY WE RE CONSIDERING WHETHER WE SHOULD RECUSE OURSELVES  HE SAID   WE DO THIS VERY RARELY  BUT WE RE LOOKING AT THIS CASE TO SEE WHETHER THAT SHOULD BE ONE OF THOSE RARE EXCEPTIONS SEVERAL STATES HAVE ATTEMPTED TO ADVANCE ABORTION BANS IN RECENT YEARS  MISSISSIPPI PASSED A LAW EARLIER THIS YEAR BANNING ABORTIONS AFTER 15 WEEKS OF PREGNANCY  BUT IT S ON HOLD AFTER A COURT CHALLENGE  THE U S  SUPREME COURT HAS DECLINED TO HEAR SIMILAR HEARTBEAT BILLS NORTH DAKOTA AND ARKANSAS APPROVED IN 2013  AFTER THEY WERE REJECTED BY THE 8TH U S  CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS A FEDERAL COURT CHALLENGE WOULD LIKELY MAKE ITS WAY TO THAT APPEALS COURT  WHICH HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY CONSERVATIVE DURING DONALD TRUMP S ADMINISTRATION OF THE 11 ACTIVE JUDGES ON THE COURT  ONLY ONE DEMOCRATIC APPOINTMENT REMAINS  JANE KELLY WAS NAMED BY BARACK OBAMA IN 2013  ONE JUDGE IS A RONALD REAGAN PICK  SIX WERE APPOINTEES OF GEORGE W  BUSH AND THREE WERE NAMED TO THE COURT BY DONALD TRUMP  TWO TRUMP JUDGES REPLACED BILL CLINTON APPOINTEES  THE THIRD REPLACED A BUSH JUDGE THE COURT BEGRUDGINGLY REJECTED AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL THE HEARTBEAT BILLS FROM NORTH DAKOTA AND ARKANSAS IN BOTH CASES THE APPEALS COURT JUDGES MADE IT CLEAR THEY WERE ONLY STRIKING DOWN THE LAWS BECAUSE THE U S  SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT BOUND THEM TO DO SO  THEY STRONGLY SUGGESTED THAT THE HIGH COURT REVERSE PREVIOUS ABORTION RULINGS BY ELIMINATING A FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ABORTION AND ALLOWING STATES TO DECIDE WHEN A FETUS IS VIABLE THE IOWA LEGISLATION CONTAINS SOME EXEMPTIONS  INCLUDING ALLOWING ABORTIONS AFTER A DETECTABLE HEARTBEAT TO SAVE A PREGNANT WOMAN S LIFE OR IN SOME CASES OF RAPE AND INCEST  ANOTHER PROVISION PROHIBITS SOME USES OF FETAL TISSUE  WITH EXEMPTIONS FOR RESEARCH  A WOMAN WOULD HAVE TO REPORT A RAPE WITHIN 45 DAYS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OR A PHYSICIAN TO QUALIFY FOR AN EXEMPTION TO THE ABORTION BAN  INCEST MUST BE REPORTED WITHIN 140 DAYS TO RECEIVE AN EXEMPTION REP  MARY WOLFE  A DEMOCRAT FROM CLINTON  SAID NOTHING WOULD STOP A WOMAN FROM LYING TO A PHYSICIAN  WHO CAN T INVESTIGATE OR REPORT THE ALLEGED CRIME  CONVERSELY  SHE SAID A CHILD WHO IS RAPED BUT DELAYS REPORTING IT UNTIL SHOWING SIGNS OF PREGNANCY COULD BE DENIED AN ABORTION THE BILL PROVIDES IMMUNITY TO WOMEN RECEIVING ABORTIONS BUT NOT TO DOCTORS WHO PERFORM THEM  THEIR LICENSES COULD BE REVOKED FOR VIOLATIONS  AND PROSECUTORS COULD CONSIDER CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST THEM  THAT S NOT ADDRESSED BY THE BILL  A POINT DEMOCRATS CRITICIZED IOWA REPUBLICANS HAVE LONG SOUGHT TO APPROVE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD FURTHER RESTRICT ABORTION  AND THEIR FLIP OF THE STATE SENATE CHAMBER IN THE 2016 ELECTION GAVE THEM A TRIFECTA OF GOP POWER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY 20 YEARS  LAST SESSION  THEY PASSED A BILL BANNING MOST ABORTIONS AFTER 20 WEEKS OF PREGNANCY  WHICH IS IN EFFECT A PROVISION IN THAT LEGISLATION REQUIRING A THREE DAY WAITING PERIOD FOR ABORTIONS  AMONG THE LONGEST WAIT PERIODS IN THE COUNTRY  WAS CHALLENGED IN COURT  IT REMAINS ON

TALK SHOW ROUNDS THIS NEW PASSION WAS IGNITED BY A COMPUTER MUSIC PROGRAM  NURTURED BY HOW TO VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE AND PERFECTED BY A CHANCE MEETING WITH ANOTHER ECLECTICALLY WIRED BROWN CLASSMATE IN SOPHIE HAWLEY WELD  AND IT HAS PRODUCED A CAREER THAT WAS ALL FORCED UPON HIM BY AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE THAT ONCE PUT HIM IN BED FOR EIGHT TERRIFYING MONTHS AFTER EARNING ALL IVY HONORABLE MENTION HONORS IN 2011 AS A SOPHOMORE  MR  HALPERN WAS SIDELINED BY FATIGUE FROM WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS A PERSISTENT CASE OF MONONUCLEOSIS  MONTHS OF HOSPITAL STAYS AND MEDICAL TESTS RULED OUT EVERYTHING FROM

LUNCH OUTINGS WITH HIS MOTHER  HE WAS SCARED  BORED AND DEPRESSED  HE NEEDED TO GET OUT OF HIS OWN HEAD  READING WASNT AN OPTION  MR  HALPERN SAYS HE IS SLIGHTLY DYSLEXIC BUT HE DID PLAY THE DRUMS AS A CHILD AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN TAKEN BY MUSIC SO I LAID THERE WITH THE LAPTOP  PUSHING BUTTONS AND WATCHING VIDEOS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE SAMPLES AND BEATS  MR  HALPERN SAID  PRETTY SOON  I WAS REACHING FOR MY COMPUTER AS SOON AS I WOKE UP AND WORKING ON MUSIC UNTIL I FELL ASLEEP HE WAS ABLE TO MANAGE THE FATIGUE WELL ENOUGH TO RETURN TO BROWN IN THE FALL OF 2012 FOR HIS JUNIOR SEASON  BUT HE SOON

20180502,business,market,4,SAN FRANCISCO  MOST BIG BANKS HAVE TRIED TO STAY FAR AWAY FROM THE SCANDAL TAINTED VIRTUAL CURRENCY BITCOIN BUT GOLDMAN SACHS  PERHAPS THE MOST STORIED NAME IN FINANCE  IS BUCKING THE RISKS AND MOVING AHEAD WITH PLANS TO SET UP WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE FIRST BITCOIN TRADING OPERATION AT A WALL STREET BANK IN A STEP THAT IS LIKELY TO LEND LEGITIMACY TO VIRTUAL CURRENCIES  AND CREATE NEW CONCERNS FOR GOLDMAN  THE BANK IS ABOUT TO BEGIN USING ITS OWN MONEY TO TRADE WITH CLIENTS IN A VARIETY OF CONTRACTS LINKED TO THE PRICE OF BITCOIN WHILE GOLDMAN WILL NOT INITIALLY BE BUYING AND SELLING ACTUAL BITCOINS  A TEAM AT THE BANK IS LOOKING AT GOING IN THAT DIRECTION IF IT CAN GET REGULATORY APPROVAL AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE ADDITIONAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HOLDING THE VIRTUAL CURRENCY RANA YARED  ONE OF THE GOLDMAN EXECUTIVES OVERSEEING THE CREATION OF THE TRADING OPERATION  SAID THE BANK WAS CLEAREYED ABOUT WHAT IT WAS GETTING ITSELF INTO I WOULD NOT DESCRIBE MYSELF AS A TRUE BELIEVER WHO WAKES UP THINKING BITCOIN WILL TAKE OVER THE WORLD  MS  YARED SAID  FOR ALMOST EVERY PERSON INVOLVED  THERE HAS BEEN PERSONAL SKEPTICISM BROUGHT TO THE TABLE STILL  THE SUGGESTION THAT GOLDMAN SACHS  AMONG THE MOST VAUNTED BANKS ON WALL STREET AND A FREQUENT TARGET FOR CRITICISM  WOULD EVEN CONSIDER TRADING BITCOIN WOULD HAVE BEEN VIEWED AS PREPOSTEROUS A FEW YEARS AGO  WHEN BITCOIN WAS PRIMARILY KNOWN AS A WAY TO BUY DRUGS ONLINE BITCOIN WAS CREATED IN 2009 BY AN ANONYMOUS FIGURE GOING BY THE NAME SATOSHI NAKAMOTO  WHO TALKED ABOUT REPLACING WALL STREET BANKS  NOT GIVING THEM A NEW REVENUE LINE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS  HOWEVER  A GROWING NUMBER OF HEDGE FUNDS AND OTHER LARGE INVESTORS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN VIRTUAL CURRENCIES  TECH COMPANIES LIKE SQUARE HAVE BEGUN OFFERING BITCOIN SERVICES TO THEIR CUSTOMERS  AND THE COMMODITY EXCHANGES IN CHICAGO STARTED ALLOWING CUSTOMERS TO TRADE BITCOIN FUTURES CONTRACTS IN DECEMBER BUT UNTIL NOW  REGULATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE STEERED CLEAR OF BITCOIN  WITH SOME GOING SO FAR AS TO SHUT DOWN THE ACCOUNTS OF CUSTOMERS WHO TRADED BITCOIN  JAMIE DIMON  THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF JPMORGAN CHASE  FAMOUSLY CALLED IT A FRAUD  AND MANY OTHER BANK CHIEF EXECUTIVES HAVE SAID BITCOIN IS NOTHING MORE THAN A SPECULATIVE BUBBLE MS  YARED SAID GOLDMAN HAD CONCLUDED THAT BITCOIN IS NOT A FRAUD AND DOES NOT HAVE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A CURRENCY  BUT A NUMBER OF CLIENTS WANTED TO HOLD IT AS A VALUABLE COMMODITY  SIMILAR TO GOLD  GIVEN THE LIMITED QUANTITY OF BITCOIN THAT CAN EVER BE MINED IN A COMPLEX  VIRTUAL SYSTEM IT RESONATES WITH US WHEN A CLIENT SAYS  I WANT TO HOLD BITCOIN OR BITCOIN FUTURES BECAUSE I THINK IT IS AN ALTERNATE STORE OF VALUE  SHE SAID MS  YARED SAID THE BANK HAD RECEIVED INQUIRIES FROM HEDGE FUNDS  AS WELL AS ENDOWMENTS AND FOUNDATIONS THAT RECEIVED VIRTUAL CURRENCY DONATIONS FROM NEWLY MINTED BITCOIN MILLIONAIRES AND DIDNT KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THEM  THE ULTIMATE DECISION TO BEGIN TRADING BITCOIN CONTRACTS WENT THROUGH GOLDMANS BOARD OF DIRECTORS THE STEP COMES WITH PLENTY OF UNCERTAINTIES  BITCOIN PRICES ARE PRIMARILY SET ON UNREGULATED EXCHANGES IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THERE ARE FEW MEASURES IN PLACE TO PREVENT MARKET MANIPULATION SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR  THE PRICE OF BITCOIN HAS PLUNGED  AND RECOVERED SIGNIFICANTLY  AS TRADERS HAVE FACED UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW REGULATORS WILL DEAL WITH VIRTUAL CURRENCIES IT IS NOT A NEW RISK THAT WE DONT UNDERSTAND  MS  YARED SAID  IT IS JUST A HEIGHTENED RISK THAT WE NEED TO BE EXTRA AWARE OF HERE GOLDMAN HAS ALREADY BEEN DOING MORE THAN MOST BANKS IN THE AREA  CLEARING TRADES FOR CUSTOMERS WHO WANT TO BUY AND SELL BITCOIN FUTURES ON THE CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE AND THE CHICAGO BOARD OPTIONS EXCHANGE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS  THE EXACT START DATE HAS NOT BEEN SET  GOLDMAN WILL BEGIN USING ITS OWN MONEY TO TRADE BITCOIN FUTURES CONTRACTS ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS  IT WILL ALSO CREATE ITS OWN  MORE FLEXIBLE VERSION OF A FUTURE  KNOWN AS A NON DELIVERABLE FORWARD  WHICH IT WILL OFFER TO CLIENTS THE BANKS FIRST DIGITAL ASSET TRADER  JUSTIN SCHMIDT  JOINED GOLDMAN TWO WEEKS AGO TO HANDLE THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS  A HIRING THAT WAS FIRST REPORTED BY TEARSHEET  IN HIS LAST JOB  MR  SCHMIDT  38  WAS AN ELECTRONIC TRADER AT THE HEDGE FUND SEVEN EIGHT CAPITAL  IN 2017  HE LEFT THAT JOB TO TRADE VIRTUAL CURRENCIES ON HIS OWN HE WILL INITIALLY BE PLACED ON GOLDMANS FOREIGN CURRENCY DESK BECAUSE BITCOIN TRADING HAS THE MOST SIMILARITY TO MOVEMENTS IN EMERGING MARKET CURRENCIES  MS  YARED SAID MR  SCHMIDT IS LOOKING AT TRADING ACTUAL BITCOIN  OR PHYSICAL BITCOIN  AS IT IS SOMEWHAT IRONICALLY CALLED  IF THE BANK CAN SECURE REGULATORY APPROVAL FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND NEW YORK AUTHORITIES THE FIRM ALSO HAS TO FIND A WAY TO CONFIDENTLY HOLD BITCOIN FOR CUSTOMERS WITHOUT ITS BEING STOLEN BY HACKERS  AS HAS HAPPENED TO MANY BITCOIN EXCHANGES  MR  SCHMIDT AND MS  YARED SAID THE CURRENT OPTIONS FOR HOLDING BITCOIN FOR CLIENTS DID NOT YET MEET WALL STREET STANDARDS GOLDMAN IS KNOWN FOR PUSHING THE ENVELOPE IN THE TRADING OF COMPLICATED PRODUCTS  THE FIRM FACED SIGNIFICANT CRITICISM AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS FOR ITS PROFITABLE TRADING OF SO CALLED SYNTHETIC DERIVATIVES TIED TO THE SUBPRIME MORTGAGE MARKETS SINCE THE CRISIS  GOLDMAN HAS MADE A BIG PUSH TO POSITION ITSELF AS THE MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY SOPHISTICATED FIRM ON WALL STREET  AMONG OTHER THINGS  IT HAS STARTED AN ONLINE LENDING SERVICE  KNOWN AS MARCUS  THAT HAS BROUGHT THE FIRM INTO CONTACT WITH RETAIL CUSTOMERS FOR THE FIRST TIME  THE VIRTUAL CURRENCY TRADING  THOUGH  WILL BE AVAILABLE ONLY TO BIG INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS MR  SCHMIDT SAID GOLDMANS SOPHISTICATION WAS A BIG PART OF THE REASON HE WAS OPEN TO THE JOB  DESPITE MANY OTHER OPPORTUNITIES IN THE VIRTUAL CURRENCY WORLD IN TERMS OF HAVING A TRUSTED INSTITUTIONAL PLAYER  IT HAS BEEN SOMETHING I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR IN MY OWN CRYPTO TRADING  BUT IT DIDNT EXIST  HE SAID

THE DISCUSSIONS WILL TAKE PLACE IN BEIJING  THE DECISIONS WILL TAKE PLACE IN WASHINGTON  SAID PETER NAVARRO  A TOP TRADE ADVISER AND LONGTIME CHINA CRITIC WHO IS AMONG THOSE TRAVELING TO BEIJING CHINA EXPERTS HAVE SAID THE TRIP IS VERY LIKELY TO BE MORE OF A LISTENING SESSION  IN WHICH ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS WILL WAIT TO HEAR WHAT THE CHINESE WILL OFFER  BUT WITHOUT AGREEMENT OR A CLEAR LIST OF GOALS FROM THE AMERICAN SIDE  THE CHINESE MAY TRY TO MOLLIFY OFFICIALS BY MEETING ONLY THE MOST MODEST OF THEIR TRADE DEMANDS  THAT COULD INCLUDE AGREEING TO BUY ADDITIONAL AMERICAN PRODUCTS TO LOWER THE TRADE SURPLUS WITH THE UNITED STATES  REVIVING OLD ECONOMIC DIALOGUES BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES  OR CRACKING OPEN SOME DOMESTIC MARKETS TO FOREIGN COMPETITION  BUT ONLY THOSE WHERE CHINESE COMPANIES ARE ALREADY SECURELY DOMINANT IN GENERAL  CHINA APPEARS SET TO TAKE A HARD LINE  CHINESE OFFICIALS SAID THEY WOULD NOT AGREE TO A  BILLION REDUCTION IN THE TRADE DEFICIT THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS DEMANDED  AND THEY DO NOT PLAN TO ENGAGE ON AMBITIOUS UNITED STATES DEMANDS TO CURB AN INDUSTRIAL PLAN KNOWN AS MADE IN CHINA 2025 THE DELEGATION ALSO INCLUDES ROBERT LIGHTHIZER  THE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE  WHO  LIKE MR  NAVARRO  EMBRACES A MORE COMBATIVE APPROACH TO DEALING WITH CHINA THAN OTHER ADVISERS ON THE TRIP  MR  NAVARRO AND MR  LIGHTHIZER HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON CHINAS TRADE PRACTICES FOR DECADES  AND INSIST THE COUNTRY MUST MAKE MORE DRAMATIC CHANGES TO EVEN THE PLAYING FIELD FOR AMERICAN COMPANIES  THEY ALSO APPEAR WILLING TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE TARIFFS PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS THREATENED  DESPITE THE PAIN IT COULD INFLICT ON MANY AMERICAN BUSINESSES AND WORKERS  IF THEY VIEW IT AS NECESSARY TO INCREASE THEIR LEVERAGE WITH THE CHINESE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE DELEGATION  INCLUDING TREASURY SECRETARY STEVEN MNUCHIN AND LARRY KUDLOW  WHO HEADS THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL  APPEAR MORE INCLINED TO STRIKE DEALS THAT WOULD ACCOMPLISH THE PRESIDENTS GOAL OF REDUCING THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT AMERICA IMPORTS FROM CHINA AND WHAT IT SELLS TO THE COUNTRY  AND THUS HEAD OFF THE RISK OF AN ESCALATING TRADE WAR  ALSO GOING ON THE TRIP ARE WILBUR ROSS  THE COMMERCE SECRETARY  WHO HAS PREVIOUSLY SEEMED RECEPTIVE TO STRIKING DEALS  EVERETT EISSENSTAT  AN EXPERIENCED TRADE ADVISER  AND TERRY BRANSTAD  THE UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO CHINA YUKON HUANG  A CHINA SCHOLAR AT THE CARNEGIE INSTITUTE  CALLED THE GROUP AN IDEOLOGICALLY HYBRID TEAM WITH COMPETING VIEWS ABOUT WHAT IS REALLY PLAGUING THE U S CHINA RELATIONSHIP ITS A MIXTURE BETWEEN TWO CAMPS  ONE FOCUSED ON TRADE ISSUES  ONE FOCUSED ON TECHNOLOGY WARS  MR  HUANG SAID  THE REASON IT IS SUCH  AND WE DONT HAVE A GAME PLAN  IS THE ISSUES ARENT WELL UNDERSTOOD AMONG THE CONCERNS ARE A RANGE OF PRACTICES  INCLUDING BARRIERS TO ENTRY  SUBSIDIES AND REGULATIONS THAT PRESSURE AMERICAN COMPANIES TO HAND OVER SENSITIVE TRADE SECRETS  WHICH CHINA USES TO MAKE NATIONAL CHAMPIONS OF ITS HOMEGROWN FIRMS  THESE TACTICS HAVE ENABLED THE CHINESE TO DOMINATE GLOBAL INDUSTRIES LIKE STEEL  ALUMINUM AND SOLAR PANELS  AND AMERICAN TRADE ADVISERS SAY THEY ARE CURRENTLY TIPPING THE PLAYING FIELD FOR INDUSTRIES OF THE FUTURE  INCLUDING SEMICONDUCTORS  ROBOTICS  CLOUD COMPUTING  ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND BIOTECHNOLOGY SPEAKING AT THE U S  CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN WASHINGTON ON TUESDAY  MR  LIGHTHIZER SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD NEARLY A THIRD OF THE WORLDS HIGH TECH BUSINESS  FOLLOWED BY CHINA  AND THAT CHINAS TRADE PRACTICES WERE IMPERILING THE ECONOMIC FUTURE OF THE UNITED STATES IM ALWAYS HOPING BUT NOT ALWAYS HOPEFUL  MR  LIGHTHIZER SAID ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF SUCCESS FROM THE TALKS MANY AMERICAN INDUSTRY LEADERS SUPPORT MR  LIGHTHIZERS EFFORTS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO CHINESE SECTORS THAT ARE RESTRICTED TO AMERICAN COMPANIES AND PROTECT AMERICAN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FROM THEFT AND COERCION  LONGSTANDING COMPLAINTS OF AMERICAN BUSINESS LEADERS ABOUT CHINAS TACTICS  BUT THEY ARE WARY OF THE ADMINISTRATIONS APPROACH TO RESOLVING LONGSTANDING PROBLEMS SOME BUSINESS LEADERS FEAR THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MAY SIMPLY ACCEPT CHINESE OFFERS TO LOWER THE TRADE SURPLUS BY BUYING MORE AMERICAN GOODS AND OPEN UP SEGMENTS OF THE ECONOMY THAT ARE ALREADY MATURE  LIKE FINANCIAL SERVICES  ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS OR THE AUTO SECTOR  ON THE OTHER HAND  THEY WORRY ABOUT THE ECONOMIC DAMAGE FROM A TRADE WAR IF THE ANTI CHINA WING OF THE DELEGATION WINS THE INTERNAL DEBATE AND FOLLOWS THROUGH WITH ITS THREATS THOMAS J  DONOHUE  THE PRESIDENT OF THE U S  CHAMBER OF COMMERCE  SAID TUESDAY THAT THERE WERE SERIOUS  GROWING AND LEGITIMATE CHALLENGES ABOUT CHINESE PRACTICES  BUT HE ALSO CAUTIONED AGAINST THE EFFECT OF A TIT FOR TAT TARIFF WAR WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT THE PROPOSED TARIFFS LIST AND ESCALATING TARIFF THREATS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT EFFECTIVELY ADVANCE OUR SHARED GOAL OF CHANGING THESE HARMFUL CHINESE PRACTICES  HE SAID ANALYSTS CONTINUE TO WARN OF POTENTIAL RISKS TO ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE UNITED STATES IF ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS CANNOT NEGOTIATE A QUICK RESOLUTION WITH THE CHINESE  AND THE TARIFFS GO INTO EFFECT  ANALYSTS AT GOLDMAN SACHS SAID IN A RESEARCH NOTE THIS WEEK THAT NEW INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS ON CHINA  WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO OUTLINE SOON  COULD ALSO RATTLE INVESTORS SOME ADDITIONAL MARKET DISRUPTIVE POLICY MOVES REGARDING U S CHINA TRADE SEEM LIKELY  GOLDMANS ALEC PHILLIPS WROTE IN THE RESEARCH NOTE  WHICH PLAYED DOWN THE ODDS OF SUCCESS IN THIS WEEKS TALKS  WE BELIEVE A SUBSTANTIAL BREAKTHROUGH AT THIS MEETING IS UNLIKELY AS THE ISSUES THE U S  HAS RAISED  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POLICIES  TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER  AND THE MADE IN CHINA 2025 STRATEGY  IN PARTICULAR  ARE NOT THE TYPE OF TECHNICAL TRADE ISSUES THAT CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS  ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL BUSINESS LOBBYING GROUPS IN WASHINGTON  HAS BEEN PRESSING MR  TRUMP AND HIS ECONOMIC TEAM TO OPEN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE CHINESE ON A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT  AN AMBITIOUS MOVE THAT MANY TRADE EXPERTS DOUBT WOULD BEAR FRUIT  GIVEN THE PAST STRUGGLES OF AMERICAN NEGOTIATORS WHO HAVE TRIED TO SECURE FAR MORE LIMITED AGREEMENTS WITH CHINA JAY TIMMONS  THE PRESIDENT OF THE MANUFACTURERS GROUP  URGED MR  TRUMP IN A LETTER THIS YEAR TO CONSIDER PURSUING A TRULY MODERN  INNOVATIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT WITH CHINA THAT WHOLLY RESTRUCTURES OUR ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP  THE GROUPS VICE PRESIDENT FOR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AFFAIRS  LINDA MENGHETTI DEMPSEY  TOLD A CONGRESSIONAL SUBCOMMITTEE IN APRIL THAT SUCH AN EFFORT WOULD BE AT ONCE BOTH A RADICAL IDEA AND  IN OUR ESTIMATION  THE MOST PRAGMATIC AND EFFECTIVE WAY FORWARD ON TRADE WITH CHINA THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ATTEMPTED TO NEGOTIATE A MORE LIMITED AGREEMENT WITH CHINA  A BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY  BUT COULD NOT FINALIZE THE DEAL BEFORE MR  TRUMP TOOK OFFICE  HIS TEAM HAS NOT YET REVIVED THE TALKS MANUFACTURERS HAVE DISCUSSED THE PLAN DIRECTLY WITH MR  KUDLOW AND WITH VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE  PROPONENTS SAY THEY BELIEVE THE IDEA COULD APPEAL TO MR  TRUMPS PREFERENCE FOR BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENTS AND HIS CONFIDENCE IN HIS NEGOTIATION SKILLS HOWEVER  WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS HAVE GIVEN NO PUBLIC INDICATION THAT THEY ARE CONSIDERING SUCH A NEGOTIATION  MR  LIGHTHIZER  MR  NAVARRO AND OTHER PROPONENTS OF A HARDER LINE AGAINST CHINA HAVE ARGUED THAT THE CHINESE TEND TO USE SUCH DIALOGUES AS A DELAYING TACTIC  AND THAT PAST TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THEM HAVE NOT BEEN PRODUCTIVE

SEEMED SINCERE AND LOOKED LIKE A HAPPY FAMILY MAN  BUT MOST IMPORTANT  HE WAS A DEMOCRAT  HER GREAT GRANDMOTHER  WHO GREW UP POOR IN PENNSYLVANIA  ALWAYS SAID THAT DEMOCRATS LOOK OUT FOR THE POOR PEOPLE IN 2016  THOUGH  SHE VOTED FOR DONALD J  TRUMP  YES  HE WAS RICH AND SEEMED MEAN ON HIS TV SHOW  THE APPRENTICE  BUT SHE LIKED HOW HE TALKED ABOUT JOBS AND WAGES AND PEOPLE BEING LEFT OUT OF THE ECONOMY NOW  MORE THAN A YEAR LATER  SHE IS WAVERING I VOTED FOR TRUMP BECAUSE I WANTED SOME CHANGE GOING ON  SAID MS  BAKER  28  BUT THEN AGAIN  MAYBE HES GOING TO DO THE WRONG CHANGE THE SWING OF OBAMA VOTERS TO MR  TRUMP PROVED A DECISIVE FACTOR IN THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION  OF THE MORE THAN 650 COUNTIES THAT CHOSE MR  OBAMA TWICE  ABOUT A THIRD FLIPPED TO MR  TRUMP  MANY WERE IN STATES CRITICAL TO MR  TRUMPS WIN  LIKE IOWA  MICHIGAN  OHIO AND WISCONSIN JOHN SIDES  A POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR AT GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY  HAS ESTIMATED THAT 9 PERCENT OF VOTERS WHO CAST BALLOTS FOR MR  OBAMA ENDED UP VOTING FOR MR  TRUMP  AMONG WHITE VOTERS WHO HAD NEVER BEEN TO COLLEGE  IT WAS 22 PERCENT NOW  AS THE COUNTRY LURCHES INTO ANOTHER ELECTION SEASON  THIS TIME THE PRIZE IS CONTROL OF CONGRESS  A CRUCIAL QUESTION FOR DEMOCRATS IS WHETHER THEY WILL BE ABLE TO LURE THESE VOTERS BACK  THE PARTY HAS HAD SOME EARLY SUCCESSES  WINS IN ALABAMA  PENNSYLVANIA AND VIRGINIA HAVE GIVEN DEMOCRATS HOPE THAT VOTERS MIGHT BE SOURING ON MR  TRUMP  TO THE POINT THAT THE PARTY MIGHT FLIP CONTROL OF THE HOUSE AND POSSIBLY EVEN THE SENATE  NEXT WEEKS PRIMARY RACES IN OHIO AND WEST VIRGINIA  BOTH STATES THAT WENT FOR MR  TRUMP IN 2016  WILL ALSO SERVE AS TESTS OF VOTER ENTHUSIASM FOR DEMOCRATS WE RECENTLY ASKED PEOPLE WHO CAST BALLOTS FOR BOTH MR  OBAMA AND MR  TRUMP TO DESCRIBE HOW THEY FELT ABOUT THE PRESIDENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AHEAD OF THE MIDTERMS  IN INTERVIEWS WITH 38 VOTERS IN 14 STATES ACROSS FOUR MONTHS  A CLEAR PATTERN EMERGED  VOTERS SAID THEY DID NOT LIKE MR  TRUMP AS A PERSON AND DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES DIE HARD SUPPORTERS  SOME WERE EVEN EMBARRASSED BY HIM BUT MANY WERE BASICALLY SATISFIED WITH HIS POLICIES  THE TAX BILL WAS MILDLY POSITIVE  THEY SAID  SEVERAL HAD A BIT OF EXTRA MONEY IN THEIR PAYCHECK  THEY LIKED THAT HE WAS TRYING TO ADDRESS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION  ONLY A FEW REGRETTED THEIR VOTE VOTERS SAID THEY STILL LIKED MR  OBAMA AND THAT THEY VOTED FOR MR  TRUMP BECAUSE THEY DIDNT WANT TO CAST A BALLOT FOR HILLARY CLINTON  BUT THEY WERE STILL OPEN TO VOTING FOR DEMOCRATS  IF THE PARTY COULD COME UP WITH THE RIGHT CANDIDATES  FOR THE MOST PART  THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS WERE NOT YET ON THEIR RADARS HONESTLY  IT HASNT CROSSED MY MIND REALLY AT ALL  MS  BAKER SAID  WHEN ASKED ABOUT THEM SEVERAL VOTERS SAID THEY CHOSE MR  TRUMP FOR THE SAME REASON THEY CHOSE MR  OBAMA  A DEEP CRAVING FOR CHANGE AND DISGUST WITH BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES CHARLOTTE GRIFFIN  THE MAYOR OF BEAR GRASS  N C  A TOWN OF ABOUT 80 PEOPLE IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE STATE  SAID HER VOTE FOR MR  TRUMP WAS MORE AN ACT OF DESPERATION THAN A POSITIVE POLITICAL CHOICE  SHE HAD GROWN FURIOUS WITH THE NATIONAL POLITICAL CLASS  AND WHAT SHE SAW AS ITS WEALTH  IGNORANCE OF ORDINARY PEOPLES LIVES AND INABILITY TO GET ANYTHING DONE  IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHED CHOSEN A REPUBLICAN IN 50 YEARS OF VOTING  HER COUNTY FLIPPED TO MR  TRUMP AFTER CHOOSING MR  OBAMA TWICE DID I REALLY LIKE TRUMP  NO  I STILL DONT  MS  GRIFFIN SAID IN JANUARY  BUT AT LEAST I THOUGHT WE MIGHT MOVE  WE WERE IN A STALEMATE  WE WERE AT DEAD CENTER ZERO  WE WERE JUST SITTING THERE SPINNING OUR WHEELS IN JANUARY  MR  TRUMP WAS DEFENDING HIMSELF AFTER AN UPROAR OVER VULGAR COMMENTS HE WAS SAID TO HAVE MADE AT A CLOSED DOOR IMMIGRATION MEETING  WHEN ASKED AGAIN IN APRIL HOW SHE FELT  MS  GRIFFIN SAID MR  TRUMP WAS STILL SEVERELY TESTING MY SENSIBILITIES SHE SAID SHE PLANNED TO VOTE FOR THE SAME DEMOCRAT  G K  BUTTERFIELD  WHO HAS BEEN HER CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVE SINCE 2004 ITS A VARIABLE WIND SITUATION  SHE SAID BY PHONE  REFERRING TO THE COUNTRY  ONE DAY IT SEEMS TO BE GOING THIS WAY  AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN ITS GOING THE OTHER WAY COUNTIES LIKE MS  GRIFFINS THAT FLIPPED FROM MR  OBAMA TO MR  TRUMP HAVE LOST GROUND TO THE REST OF THE NATION  EVEN MORE SO THAN THE COUNTIES THAT HAVE BEEN SOLIDLY REPUBLICAN  FORTY YEARS AGO  WORKERS IN THE FLIP COUNTIES EARNED 85 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR EARNED BY WORKERS IN THE DEMOCRATIC STRONGHOLDS  BY 2016  THE RATIO HAD FALLEN TO 77 CENTS MS  BAKER WORKS AT A HAIR SALON STARK COUNTY  OHIO  WHICH FLIPPED TO MR  TRUMP AFTER CHOOSING MR  OBAMA TWICE  AND SHE SAID THE PRESIDENT WAS AN ECONOMIC DISAPPOINTMENT HES NOT THERE FOR THE POOR AND THE MIDDLE CLASS  SHE SAID  SITTING ON HER MOTHERS COUCH IN THE SMALL TOWN OF

PACKAGING PLANT FOR CAMERA MEMORY CHIPS AND A FRAME STORE  ALL PAID BADLY  SHE DIDNT HAVE HEALTH CARE OR 401 K  RETIREMENT BENEFITS WITH ANY OF THEM MS  BAKER HATED MAKING MINIMUM WAGE  AND HOW POWERLESS IT MADE HER FEEL  SO SHE ENROLLED IN BEAUTY SCHOOL TO GET MORE CONTROL OVER HER LIFE SHE HAD HOPED MR  TRUMP WOULD RAISE WAGES AND FORCE COMPANIES TO GIVE ALL THEIR EMPLOYEES BENEFITS  BUT THAT HASNT HAPPENED  ALL SHE HEARS NOW IS HARSH TALK BY REPUBLICANS ON TV ABOUT POOR PEOPLE  HOW PEOPLE WHO GET FOOD STAMPS ARE LAZY  HOW THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN BOXES OF FOOD INSTEAD OF MONEY MS  BAKER KNOWS THERE IS ANOTHER ELECTION THIS YEAR  BUT LIKE MOST PEOPLE INTERVIEWED FOR THIS ARTICLE  SHE SAID SHE HAD NOT LOOKED UP THE CANDIDATES YET  SHE WAS NOT SURE IF SHE WOULD VOTE MANY PEOPLE INTERVIEWED WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY TO SAY THEY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES TRUMP SUPPORTERS DONNA BURGRAFF  A REGISTERED INDEPENDENT IN CHILLICOTHE  IN SOUTHERN OHIO  SAID SHE FINDS MR  TRUMP BOORISH  SHE SAID THAT HE JUDGES WOMEN ON THEIR LOOKS AND SEEMS TO THRIVE ON EMBARRASSING PEOPLE  BEHAVIOR THAT MS  BURGRAFF  AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF EDUCATION AT OHIO UNIVERSITY  DISAPPROVES OF MS  BURGRAFF

JUDGES ABOUT TRUMP S BAN ON TRAVELERS FROM MOSTLY MUSLIM COUNTRIES  IT FOUND ONLY ONE JUDGE NOMINATED BY A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT HAS SUPPORTED TRUMP S AUTHORITY TO KEEP OUT ALL TRAVELERS OR DEPORT

CONSIDERED DIFFERENT LAWSUITS IN DIFFERENT COURTS 3 000 MILES  4 800 KILOMETERS  APART  BUT THEY WERE ALSO NOMINATED TO THE BENCH BY PRESIDENTS FROM DIFFERENT PARTIES  GORTON BY REPUBLICAN GEORGE H W  BUSH AND BIROTTE BY DEMOCRAT BARACK OBAMA FOR THE MOST PART  THE JUDICIAL SPLIT ALONG PARTY LINES HAS CONTINUED AS THE BAN S VARIOUS VERSIONS HAVE MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH FEDERAL COURTS  THE THREE BANS

JOURNEY  EXAMINING 26 DECISIONS BY 38 JUDGES  THE TWO KEY FINDINGS  A MAJORITY OF THE JUDGES  24  WERE NOMINATED BY DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTS  ONLY ONE OF THOSE JUDGES SUPPORTED TRUMP S POWER TO BLOCK ALL

CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS  PRODUCED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE DECISIONS OF REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC JUDICIAL NOMINEES  BUT IN OTHER AREAS  POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS WERE GOOD PREDICTORS OF JUDGES  RULINGS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS WERE AMONG THE ISSUES ON WHICH REPUBLICAN NOMINEES WERE MORE LIKELY TO TAKE A CONSERVATIVE VIEW  WHILE THEIR DEMOCRATIC COUNTERPARTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO GO IN A LIBERAL DIRECTION  THE RESEARCHERS FOUND THE REALITY IS  THERE ARE CERTAIN HOT BUTTON ISSUES WHERE YOU VE GOT THESE SPLITS  AND THERE S NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE  SAID DAVID

NOMINEES HAVE POINTED TO THE PRESIDENT S CAMPAIGN RHETORIC ABOUT BARRING MUSLIMS FROM ENTERING THE COUNTRY AS EVIDENCE THE BANS ARE ILLEGALLY MOTIVATED BY RELIGIOUS PREJUDICE  THEY SAID THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDED INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE FOR ITS CLAIM THAT THE BANS ARE NEEDED FOR U S  SECURITY THE  INITIAL  ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE MUSLIM BAN  OFFERED REPEATEDLY AND EXPLICITLY THROUGH PRESIDENT

RESTRICTS TRAVEL TO THE UNITED STATES BY RESIDENTS OF FIVE MAJORITY MUSLIM COUNTRIES  DOWN FROM SEVEN IN THE FIRST BAN  AS WELL AS NORTH KOREA  IT ALSO RESTRICTS TRAVELERS FROM VENEZUELA THE JUSTICES

CHINA BY  BILLION OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND A HALT ON CHINESE SUBSIDIES FOR ADVANCED MANUFACTURING SECTORS THE DEMANDS  WHICH SPREAD ON CHINESE SOCIAL MEDIA AND WERE CONFIRMED BY A PERSON CLOSE TO THE NEGOTIATIONS  SUGGESTED THAT BOTH SIDES HARDENED THEIR POSITIONS THIS WEEK DESPITE THE TWO DAYS OF TALKS  SENIOR CHINESE OFFICIALS AND THEIR ADVISERS WERE ALSO SENDING A DELIBERATE MESSAGE TO THE WEST THAT THE DAYS OF BEIJING BEING CONCILIATORY WERE OVER  AND THAT CHINA WAS STAKING OUT ITS OWN POSITION IN THE NEGOTIATIONS THE PERSON CLOSE TO THE NEGOTIATIONS INSISTED ON ANONYMITY BECAUSE OF DIPLOMATIC SENSITIVITIES THE EXTENSIVE LIST OF UNITED STATES TRADE DEMANDS WAS UNEXPECTEDLY SWEEPING  AND SHOWED THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS NO INTENTION OF BACKING DOWN DESPITE BEIJINGS ASSERTIVE STANCE IN THE LAST FEW DAYS  THE LIST READS LIKE THE TERMS FOR A SURRENDER RATHER THAN A BASIS FOR NEGOTIATION  SAID ESWAR PRASAD  AN ECONOMICS PROFESSOR AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY HERE ARE THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE DEMANDS CHINA MUST  CUT ITS TRADE SURPLUS BY  BILLION IN THE 12 MONTHS STARTING IN JUNE  AND BY ANOTHER  BILLION IN THE FOLLOWING 12 MONTHS  HALT ALL SUBSIDIES TO ADVANCED MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES IN ITS SO CALLED MADE IN CHINA 2025 PROGRAM  THE PROGRAM COVERS 10 SECTORS  INCLUDING AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURING  ELECTRIC CARS  ROBOTICS  COMPUTER MICROCHIPS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  ACCEPT THAT THE UNITED STATES MAY RESTRICT IMPORTS FROM THE INDUSTRIES UNDER MADE IN CHINA 2025  TAKE IMMEDIATE  VERIFIABLE STEPS TO HALT CYBERESPIONAGE INTO COMMERCIAL NETWORKS IN THE UNITED STATES  STRENGTHEN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTIONS  ACCEPT UNITED STATES RESTRICTIONS ON CHINESE INVESTMENTS IN SENSITIVE TECHNOLOGIES WITHOUT RETALIATING  CUT ITS TARIFFS  WHICH CURRENTLY AVERAGE 10 PERCENT  TO THE SAME LEVEL AS IN THE UNITED STATES  WHERE THEY AVERAGE 3 5 PERCENT FOR ALL NONCRITICAL SECTORS  OPEN UP ITS SERVICES AND AGRICULTURAL SECTORS TO FULL AMERICAN COMPETITION THE UNITED STATES ALSO STIPULATED THAT THE TWO SIDES SHOULD MEET EVERY QUARTER TO REVIEW PROGRESS CHINESE OFFICIALS PUT THE TALKS IN A POSITIVE LIGHT  THE TWO SIDES AGREED THAT A SOUND AND STABLE CHINA U S  TRADE RELATIONSHIP IS CRUCIAL FOR BOTH  AND THEY ARE COMMITTED TO RESOLVING RELEVANT ECONOMIC AND TRADE ISSUES THROUGH DIALOGUE AND CONSULTATION  XINHUA  THE OFFICIAL NEWS AGENCY  SAID SOON AFTER THE TALKS ENDED BUT THE NEGOTIATIONS ALSO HIGHLIGHTED KEY DIFFERENCES  AND THE AMERICAN DELEGATIONS TIGHT LIPPED DEPARTURE FROM DIAOYUTAI  THE PARKLIKE ENCLOSURE OF GUESTHOUSES WHERE THE TALKS WERE HELD  SUGGESTED THAT THE TWO SIDES HAD MADE LITTLE HEADWAY IN SOLVING THEM BEFORE THE TRADE TALKS BEGAN  PEOPLE INVOLVED IN CHINAS POLICYMAKING SAID  BEIJING WAS WILLING TO ACT ON SOME CONCESSIONS PREVIOUSLY LAID OUT BY PRESIDENT XI JINPING  AMONG THE MOST NOTABLE WAS A WILLINGNESS TO MAKE IT SLIGHTLY EASIER FOR FOREIGN AUTOMAKERS AND FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO COMPETE IN CHINA BUT CHINA HAS ITS OWN DEMANDS  BEIJING WANTS THE UNITED STATES TO RELAX RESTRICTIONS ON EXPORTS OF HIGH TECH COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS THAT MAY HAVE MILITARY APPLICATIONS  DURING THE TRADE TALKS HERE THIS WEEK  CHINESE OFFICIALS ALSO TOOK ISSUE WITH THE PENALTIES THAT AMERICAN OFFICIALS IMPOSED LAST MONTH ON ZTE  A CHINESE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY  FOR REPEATEDLY VIOLATING UNITED STATES SANCTIONS ON IRAN THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT BANNED ALL SHIPMENTS OF AMERICAN WARES TO ZTE  INCLUDING CHIPS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO MANY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS  THE MOVE APPEARS TO HAVE STRENGTHENED CHINAS RESOLVE TO CONTINUE ITS DRIVE FOR SELF SUFFICIENCY AND TO CURB IMPORTS IN VARIOUS HIGH TECH FIELDS CHINAS PUSH TO UPGRADE ITS TECHNOLOGY ACCOUNTS FOR MANY OF ITS DISAGREEMENTS WITH THE UNITED STATES  THE AMERICAN DOCUMENT REITERATED TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CALLS FOR A BROAD HALT OF CHINESE SUBSIDIES TO MANUFACTURERS IN ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES  AND CHINESE OFFICIALS HAVE DEFENDED THE MADE IN 2025 PROGRAM AS ESSENTIAL TO UPGRADING THE ECONOMY AND HAVE SAID THEY WOULD NOT AGREE TO ANY LIMITS ON THE MADE IN CHINA PROGRAM BEIJING HAS SAID IT WOULD BE WILLING TO REDUCE SOME TRADE BARRIERS  BUT ONLY IF THE UNITED STATES ALSO LOWERED TRADE BARRIERS  CHINESE OFFICIALS PARTICULARLY OBJECT TO AMERICAN LIMITS ON THE EXPORT OF HIGH TECH GOODS THAT HAVE BOTH CIVILIAN AND MILITARY APPLICATIONS  CONTENDING THAT THESE RESTRICTIONS PREVENT SIZABLE POTENTIAL EXPORTS THEY ALSO OBJECTED TO UNITED STATES DEMANDS FOR A SPECIFIC CUT IN THE BILATERAL SURPLUS  LI GANG  THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMERCE MINISTRYS RESEARCH AND TRAINING INSTITUTE  SAID IN A SEPARATE INTERVIEW LAST MONTH THAT A  BILLION CUT IN THE SURPLUS WAS IMPOSSIBLE  CHINAS SURPLUS HAS BEEN WIDENING LATELY AS THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY GROWS FAIRLY STRONGLY AND TAKES IN MORE IMPORTS THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCED ON THURSDAY IN WASHINGTON THAT THE TRADE IMBALANCE WITH CHINA HAD WIDENED SLIGHTLY IN MARCH COMPARED WITH THE SAME MONTH A YEAR AGO  ALTHOUGH IT NARROWED SLIGHTLY COMPARED WITH FEBRUARY  POSSIBLY FOR SEASONAL REASONS THE LACK OF A DEAL THIS WEEK  AS WELL AS THE FAILURE TO SCHEDULE FURTHER TALKS RIGHT AWAY  DOES NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT CHINESE NEGOTIATORS WILL VISIT THE UNITED STATES NEXT MONTH FOR FURTHER TALKS  ONE POSSIBILITY THAT AMERICAN OFFICIALS HAVE CONSIDERED IS WHETHER CHINA MIGHT SEND VICE PRESIDENT WANG QISHAN  WHO IS CLOSE TO MR  XI  ON A FOLLOW UP TRIP SO FAR  THE CHINESE SIDE HAS BEEN LED BY LIU HE  A POLITBURO MEMBER WHO IS ALSO THE VICE PREMIER FOR FINANCE  TRADE AND TECHNOLOGY TRADE EXPERTS HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR WEEKS THAT CHINESE OFFICIALS WOULD LIKE TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE WITH THE UNITED STATES SO THAT THEY CAN GO BACK TO FOCUSING ON ISSUES CLOSER TO HOME THATS THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM  BECAUSE ITS A HEADACHE FOR THEM THATS DISTRACTING FROM A VERY PRESSING DOMESTIC AGENDA  SAID CHRISTOPHER K  JOHNSON  A FORMER C I A  OFFICER WHO ANALYZED CHINA AND NOW HOLDS THE FREEMAN CHAIR IN CHINA STUDIES AT THE CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES THE BEIJING TALKS WERE UNLIKELY TO RESULT IN A COMPREHENSIVE DEAL  BUT EXPERTS SAID THEY COULD STILL BE A FIRST STEP TOWARD REACHING SOME SORT OF ACCORD THERES NO WAY OUR TEAM IS GOING TO RISK SIGNING UP TO SOMETHING WITHOUT GETTING BACK HERE AND MAKING SURE THAT TRUMP IS HAPPY WITH IT FIRST  MR  JOHNSON SAID  MAYBE THERES ALSO SOME OPTICS WHERE TRUMP WANTS TO BE SEEN STANDING WITH WANG QISHAN AND STRIKING THE DEAL I THINK WERE STILL SEVERAL JUMPS DOWN THE TRACK FROM THAT
